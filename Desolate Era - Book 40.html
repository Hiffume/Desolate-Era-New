<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fate
had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: The Imprisoned Exalt</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Spacetime
around the Wellspring Sea was in a state of constant flux. It had
taken even the Blazesun Ruler a full three years of travel via his
warship before he had managed to pass through it. Ji Ning was at a
higher level of insight than him, but it had still taken Ning a full
five months before passing through the region of dangerous, distorted
spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
you made a mistake when passing through a region of distorted
spacetime, you could end up within a spacetime fragment and be
forever unable to escape! If you were ‘lucky’, you might simply
be teleported to an incredibly distant place… which might end up
being a death trap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why the Blazesun Ruler had felt so certain that he was the only
person to discover the Blazesun Wellspring Sea. At first, he didn’t
even consider the possibility that Ning would be there. It was only
after his forces had searched the entire Blazesun Domain to no avail
that he had thought of this place and came here to test us luck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Head
in that direction,” Ning ordered as he used his Sword Dao domain to
chop a spacetime tunnel open for the realmship to pass through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Wellspring Sea truly was hidden quite well,” Hegemon Azurefiend
mumbled to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
often visit the Blazesun Domain, but I’ve never even heard of this
place,” Patriarch Treewind said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
continued to advance through the twisting, changing spacetime
continuum. They constantly changed directions as they advanced, and
after a full month Ning suddenly called out, “Halt!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
we haven’t left yet,” Hegemon Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
preparing to train here for a period of time,” Ning said with a
smile. “This is currently the safest place in the entire Blazesun
Domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?”
Everyone present looked flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Wellspring Sea is like a boulder which is sitting within many
currents of chaotic spacetime,” Ning said. “It doesn’t matter
which way we go; we’ll still run into those streams. The Blazesun
Ruler is at a lower level of insight than me; even if he came back
with four other Domain Rulers, he would still just follow the
pathways he is already familiar with. There’s no way he would
search and scan all of the possible routes. At his current level, if
he dared to do so he’d probably get lost! My guess is that the
reason why he was even able to find the Wellspring Sea was because he
had the warship helping him out; otherwise, he would never have been
able to find this place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
guess was correct. The warship was even more tightly attuned to
spacetime than ordinary realmships were, and it was primarily thanks
to the warship that the Blazesun Ruler had been able to find the
Wellspring Sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
won’t be able to find me as I train here,” Ning said. “Their
chances might improve if there are three or four of them, but
eventually the other Domain Rulers will have to go back. There’s no
way they’ll stay in the Blazesun Domain the entire time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
partially wanted a quiet place to train, but he also wanted to be
cautious. Battling against the likes of the Blazesun Ruler was truly
pointless for him. They were merely at the Hegemonic level of
insight; their primary advantage lay in the fact that they were truly
blessed with incredible gifts. Ning had only been able to destroy 5%
of the Blazesun Ruler’s truesoul with a full-power strike; a battle
against a Domain Ruler would literally be nothing more than Ning
pitting his truesoul against the Domain Ruler’s in a war of
attrition. Ning truly couldn’t be bothered to take part in
something like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
speaks the truth. It is best to be cautious,” Nuwa agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
yes. Let’s spend some more time here.” Su Youji was similarly
worried about Ning exhausting too much energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Ning began to train within a small spacetime pocket located
within the chaotic spacetime surrounding the Wellspring Sea. Every
day, he was able to hear the whooshing, rumbling sound of the
Wellspring Sea. Even Su Youji, who walked the path of the Dao of
Fire, began to gain many insights and began to train. Ning himself
continued to focus on slowly merging his Dao of Water into his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao. After spending a total of 1.2 billion years,
he finally completed the process and fully integrated his Dao of
Water into his Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Supremely
kind and gentle, and filled with all the secrets of water… I
suppose I can call this the Water Sword Dao.” Ning smiled as he
opened his eyes. He could sense that his sword-heart was a hair more
calm and peaceful than it had been in the past. This was the nature
of water; it struggled against nothing and accepted everything.
Thanks to the Dao of Water, his soul and truesoul were now
significantly calmed and began to disintegrate much more slowly than
before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
killed the Lonely King and the eight-armed giant, then struck out
against the Blazesun Ruler. These actions caused my truesoul to
disintegrate more quickly, but integrating the mysteries of the Dao
of Water into my Sword Dao caused the process to slow down once
again. These things actually ended up cancelling each other out. I
still have roughly eight thousand chaos cycles left to me.” Ning
laughed, but he knew that there was no way to make up for what he had
lost during those three battles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he had never fought at all, then the full integration of the Dao of
Water would’ve resulted in his lifespan being extended to ten
thousand chaos cycles! It must be remembered that his other Daos,
such as the Dao of Lightning, would be of little use to him in
preserving his truesoul. Ning had the feeling that the Dao of Water
was the most effective in this regard… but alas, its benefits had
been cancelled out by the battles he had taken part in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
battles had an effect akin to creating cracks on a dike. Each battle
would cause those cracks to become greater and greater, hastening the
day when the dike crumbled apart in its entirety.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning stretched out his right hand, causing a sword to manifest in the
palm of his hand. This was an unadorned sword that looked extremely
ordinary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
This sword…” Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, Azurefiend, Goodsong, and
the others inside the realmship couldn’t help but feel intrigued
and enticed by that sword. It looked quite ordinary, but in their
hearts they couldn’t help but feel that this sword somehow embodied
all the mysteries of the Dao of the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled as he then reached out with his left hand. A second sword
appeared within the palm of his left hand, but this one was covered
with a layer of flowing watery light that made it seem calmer, more
beautiful, and more gentle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
one side is the ‘pure’ Eternal Omega Sword Dao,” Ning said with
a laugh, “And on the other is the Eternal Omega Sword Dao that has
been infused with the mysteries of water. I suppose you can call it
the Water Sword Dao. Can you sense the differences between the two?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
first seems purer; save for the sword, there is nothing else,” Nuwa
said. “I can sense a gentle stream of water coming from the other…
but it also feels like a vast, completely calm ocean.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
purity better, or is infusing other mysteries better?” Patriarch
Treewind couldn’t help but ask.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded in response to the question. “In the early stages of
cultivation, purity is better! But when you reach the utmost apex in
purity and are unable to advance any further, that’s when you’ll
need to broaden your base. Alright, I’ve already completed my task.
Given that it has been 1.2 billion years, my guess is that even if
the Blazesun Ruler did invite other Domain Rulers to come help him
out, they’ve probably left by now after all these years of
fruitless waiting. Let’s head out and go towards the place where
that Sithe Exalt has been imprisoned.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go!” Flamewing said excitedly. Finally! It had grown bored long
ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
never seen a Sithe Exalt either.” Azurefiend was filled with
anticipation as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe Exalts of legend…” Nuwa and Su Youji had never seen one of
them either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Thanks to Ning’s guidance, the realmship spent another three months
before finally exiting the region of distorted spacetime and
returning to the normal spacetime continuum. Next, Ning’s group
spent another month riding the realmship before finally reaching the
place where the legendary Sithe Exalt was imprisoned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
place where the Sithe Exalt has been imprisoned is known as the
Earthfire Continent,” Patriarch Treewind explained. “Anyone who
sees a Sithe Exalt will feel a sense of awe. The feeling they give us
is completely different from the feeling which the Blazesun Ruler
gives us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Completely
different?” Ning was startled. “But aren’t the Sithe Exalts on
par with the Blazesun Ruler in power?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
understand when you see him,” Patriarch Treewind said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe Exalts are rather pitiable creatures,” Imperator Jade Rainbow
said. He shook his head and sighed. “Everyone who sees them feels
sorry for them, but none of us dares to go too close to them. This is
because the Sithe Exalts remain as crazed and berserk as ever. If you
go too close, you might end up dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
they chatted, a vast continent suddenly appeared in the void in front
of them. This continent was so gigantic in size, it was impossible
for them to see to the ends of it. The realmship flew into the skies
above the vast continent, with Patriarch Treewind and Imperator Jade
Rainbow guiding them closer and closer to the prison.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom!!! Even though they were still very far away, Ning was
already able to vaguely hear a series of booming sounds. He was also
able to see with the naked eye a hint of fiery light flickering from
far away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the realmship flew closer and closer, the fiery light became
increasingly dazzling to behold. It was actually a vast field of
fiery light that stretched off to cover an area of ten billion
kilometers. It was like a field of divine punishment that was
crushing and suppressing a blurry figure at the very center of the
field. The blurry figure was seated in the lotus position, its body
emanating an aura of tremendous power that was fighting back against
the endless field of fiery light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning turned pale. The vast field of fiery light clearly concentrated
its power at the center, where an endless series of explosions
continued to burst out against the blurry figure. The power of each
explosion vastly surpassed the full-strength strikes of the Blazesun
Ruler… and the aura emanating from the blurry figure was clearly
superior to the Blazesun Ruler’s as well!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Didn’t
they say that the Sithe Exalt was on par with the Blazesun Ruler in
power?” Ning immediately felt puzzled by this.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_002__The"></A>
Chapter 2: Crazed</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship continued to fly towards the prison. Ji Ning could see that
within the fiery field of ten billion kilometers, there were actually
a series of other figures who were either seated in the lotus
position or located within small buildings. These cultivators were
scattered in the region around the Sithe Exalt, with even the closest
maintaining a minimum distance of ten million kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth,” Patriarch Treewind immediately explained, “The
Earthfire Continent is extremely famous. Quite a few cultivators come
here to visit, and every so often the imprisoned Sithe Exalt will
provide them with some guidance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Guidance?”
Ning was surprised. “The Sithe are our mortal enemies. Why would it
be so kind-hearted as to provide us with some guidance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
it perhaps be a trick?” Nuwa guessed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Imperator
Jade Rainbow laughed. “The Sithe Exalt has been imprisoned here for
countless years. It is possible that to him, the occasional
interaction with cultivators is a form of temporary release. How can
there be any ‘tricks’ when pointing out the flaws in their Daos?
If they were wrong in their Dao, they were wrong. Quite a few
cultivators have already perfected their Daos thanks to this Exalt’s
guidance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
This was the first time that Ning, Su Youji, Nuwa, and many of the
others within the realmship had heard such a thing. All of them felt
that this really didn’t make much sense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Hegemon Azurefiend said, “There are other cultivators here. I’m
afraid that they’ll immediately recognize you once you appear, and
then word will probably spread out quite quickly. Is it possible that
the Blazesun Ruler would head over here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “Don’t worry; I wager that the Blazesun Ruler wouldn’t
dare to come here on his own! It would take him time to summon four
or five of the other Domain Rulers and then make it all the way over
to the Earthfire Continent. All I wish to do is visit the Sithe
Exalt; half a day will be more than enough! By the time the Blazesun
Ruler arrives, we’ll have left long ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Watched by many cultivators, the realmship finally descended upon
this great continent. This entire region was covered by fiery light,
but the pressure wasn’t all that great; the centermost region where
the Sithe Exalt resided suffered the vast majority of the pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Which
major power has just arrived?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
actually descended upon the Earthfire Continent via realmship. It
seems an extraordinary figure has just appeared in our midst.” The
scattered cultivators all stared towards the descending realmship.
They watched as a large number of people flew out from within the
realmship, with the leader being a white-robed youth who bore a black
sheath on his back. Next to him stood the dazzlingly beautiful Su
Youji as well as the honest-looking Protector Whitethaw. Nuwa,
Hegemon Azurefiend, Hegemon Goodsong, the Flamewing God, Patriarch
Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and the others all appeared next to
them as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
Patriarch Treewind!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
actually Patriarch Treewind and Imperator Jade Rainbow? I heard that
they left this place alongside Daolord Darknorth. I even heard that
the Blazesun Ruler had gone to Houwu City to hunt them down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
white-robed Daolord at their head… his truesoul is slowly crumbling
away. That should be the legendary Daolord Darknorth, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
white-robed youth who bears a black sheath on his back and who failed
the Daomerge… Hegemon Goodsong is by his side, as is a dazzlingly
beautiful red-robed woman… yes, that has to be Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
almost certainly has to be Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
formerly-calm cultivators suddenly all grew excited. A violet-robed
elder who was an old friend of Patriarch Treewind’s actually
reached out to him mentally: “Brother Treewind, is that the
legendary Daolord Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is indeed,” Patriarch Treewind said proudly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings to you, Daolord Darknorth,” the violet-robed elder
hurriedly rose to his feet and bowed as he said these words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other Hegemons and Emperors present emerged as well and all bowed
respectfully towards Ning: “Respectful greetings to you, Daolord
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning wasn’t the type to stand on formal ceremony, all of the
cultivators he had encountered recently had spoken to him in this
very respectful manner, and so Ning no longer tried to dissuade them.
In fact, if he was excessively courteous to them, many of them would
actually begin to feel nervous!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Carry
on, gentlemen. I’ve merely come to take a look at the Sithe Exalt,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the cultivators all assented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivators had all come out to greet Ning respectfully. Some of the
other creatures residing here quickly noticed this behavior. This was
an important place where the Sithe Exalt was imprisoned, after all;
the Blazesun Ruler had naturally arranged for some of his
subordinates to be permanently stationed here and watch over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?” Multiple creatures emerged. Some popped their heads up
from beneath the earth while some manifested out of bonfires. All of
them stared at the distant white-robed youth in astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Domain Ruler has been searching for Daolord Darknorth this entire
time… who would’ve thought that he’d suddenly appear in the
Earthfire Continent?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Notify
the Domain Ruler right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and notify the Domain Ruler!” None of the creatures dared to
approach Ning, but since they were responsible for keeping a watch
over the trapped Sithe Exalt, they naturally had ways to send
information up the chain of command. They all sent word in almost the
same instant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning arrived, he didn’t just attract interest from the cultivators
and the other creatures; he also attracted the attention of the Sithe
Exalt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Explosions continued to blast away at his body. All of
the power of the fiery light was concentrated here and continuously
hammered away at him. These attacks all seemed quite ferocious, but
in truth they were all quite different.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
were like countless needles that stabbed into his body, piercing into
his very soul and truesoul. They caused truly soul-tearing agony!
Others were like knives that continuously cut away at his skin; they
didn’t cause any real injuries at all, but the pain was
excruciating! Still others carried illusory effects. In short, all of
these attacks served to torment it to the extreme! Although the Sithe
Exalt was dressed in gray armor, the exposed parts of his arm, neck,
and face were all covered by strange formation-diagrams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Beneath
his feet, there was an enormous formation-diagram that was ten
thousand kilometers in size which was identical to the ones covering
him. The formation-diagram was imprinted on every part of his body,
ensuring that he was perpetually trapped, suppressed, and tormented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhhh!”
He let out a screeching roar. He had three curved horns growing out
of his head, and a pair of azure eyes that stared intently at the
distant Ning. “DIE! EVERYONE SHOULD DIE!” He continuously raved,
repeating these words over and over again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been trapped here for far too long. He had been imprisoned here
since their defeat in the Dawn War. The Autarchs had used their full
power to set up this sealing formation-diagram, then established the
most tortuous methods available to them to force him to suffer
perpetual torment. The suppressive effects of the formation-diagram
made it impossible for him to even commit suicide! There was nothing
save endless torture, unless he was willing to lower his head and
choose a humiliating path…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone
should die…” he mumbled. He had repeated these words far, far too
many times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of them are craven and afraid to move too close to me.” He stared
off into the distance, his azure eyes filled with malice. He truly
did wish to squish these bugs and kill them all! Alas, the little
bugs were all quite cautious. After having been sealed away, his
attack distance had become limited to a mere million kilometers.
After he had successfully killed a few of those ants, the rest had
grown cautious and stayed at least ten million kilometers away from
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings to you, Daolord Darknorth!” The distant cultivators all
bowed towards Ning with tremendous respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The Exalt’s attention was drawn to this. It had been a long, long
time since he had seen these cultivators treated someone else so
respectfully; the last time had been when the Blazesun Ruler had come
to this place. Yes, the Autarchs also received this sort of reception
when they came, but there was no way any other cultivators would.
This was because the cultivators here consisted of Hegemons and
Otherverse Lords; it was extremely hard for someone else to convince
them to display such respect!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth? Huh? He’s a Daolord of their civilization?” He was
puzzled. “Daolords should be weaker than Emperors in their system,
right? Why are so many of them being so respectful?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
word that Ning had mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao had spread
like wildfire across the cultivator civilizations, the imprisoned
Sithe Exalt had not been informed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
feeling he gives me… wait. Something’s wrong. That’s no
ordinary Daolord.” He focused his gaze on Ning. “And… he’s
failed his Daomerge? In their civilization, the Daolords who fail the
Daomerge shall face certain death. This Daolord has failed the
Daomerge, but they are all so respectful to him… and he gives me a
strange feeling, almost as though he is a match for me…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
his eyes widened as an enormous suspicion swept through his heart
like a tidal wave. “Can it… is he… yes. There’s no mistaking
it. That’s the only possibility!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord who can inspire such respect from even Otherverse Lords and
who is a match for even myself… there’s only one possibility!”
His azure eyes suddenly blazed with incredible luminosity. “Can it
be that their civilization has finally given birth to someone who is
in control of an Eternal Omega Dao? Thankfully, he’s a Daolord who
has failed the Daomerge. He doesn’t have much time left; otherwise,
he’d be a major problem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao, eh?” The Sithe Exalt
quickly came to this conclusion solely based off the scene appearing
before him. It was an easy guess to make. The only way a Daolord who
failed the Daomerge could be so powerful as to eclipse even
Otherverse Lords was if that Daolord was in control of an Eternal
Omega Dao. There were no other possibilities!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
if they’ve given birth to one, they’ll probably give birth to a
second, a third, a fourth. Haha… are we finally going to lose? I
hope we do. Let’s lose and end it all! Everyone should die.
Everyone should die!” he mumbled, his eyes turning even more crazed
than before.</P>

Chapter 3: Exalt Dauber</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
rest of you can stay here. No need to get too close to him,” Ji
Ning said. “I’ll go and chat with the Sithe Exalt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Daolord,” Patriarch Treewind said hurriedly. “The Sithe
Exalt can attack at any moment. Even though he has been imprisoned,
he can launch attacks out to a range of one million kilometers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Imperator Jade Rainbow said, “Treewind, not even the
Blazesun Ruler is close to being a match for the Daolord, much less
this imprisoned Sithe Exalt. However… Daolord, Treewind speaks the
truth. It wouldn’t be worth it if you ended up in a fight against
this Exalt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
thank you for your advice.” Ning smiled and nodded, then began to
walk towards the centermost region of this field of flaming light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa,
Su Youji, and Azurefiend all watched as he left. Flamewing hesitated
for a bit, in the end deciding not to follow. In its heart, it
couldn’t help but feel a bit of aversion towards Sithe Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
field of flaming light had accumulated all of the fire elemental
energy of the surrounding area, concentrating it into a series of
terrifying attacks at the center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Every
single one of these strikes surpasses the maximum power of the
Blazesun Ruler… but the Sithe Exalt is able to endure them with
ease. No matter how I inspect him, I keep on having the feeling that
he should be stronger than the Blazesun Ruler… but everyone in the
outside world agrees that the Blazesun Ruler is on par with Sithe
Exalts in power.” Ning stared at the Exalt, his heart filled with
suspicions. Suddenly, his gaze focused upon the incredibly
complicated formation-diagram that covered the area of ten thousand
kilometers around the seated Sithe Exalt. That formation-diagram was
the center and core of this entire field of flaming light!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
exposed parts of the Sithe Exalt’s skin were also covered by
identical imprints of that formation-diagram.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
THAT is a nasty trick!” Ning sucked in a cold breath. “The person
who set up this formation-diagram vastly surpasses me in the Dao of
Formation.” Ning continued to stare. “And… this
formation-diagram includes the Dao of Fire, the Dao of Illusions, the
Dao of Darkness, and many other instruments of torture. Many are
meant to attack the soul and truesoul. In all the Chaosverse, only
the Autarchs could possibly set up a formation-diagram which contains
so many Daos.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
were at the Daobirth level, where ‘one Dao births many Daos’.
Autarch Bolin had reached Autarchy via the Dao of the Claw, and he
had also reached Hegemony in all of the other Daos! Formations,
illusions… even Daos he had never trained in; he had reached
Hegemony in all of them upon gaining Autarchy! Thus, Autarchs were
naturally able to employ many different Daos in setting up
formation-diagrams. The person who had set up this formation had
mixed the various Daos together perfectly. It seemed as though the
Autarchs weren’t just the strongest cultivators in the Chaosverse,
they were also the most terrifying torturers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
much hatred must the Autarchs hold towards them? Why is it that they
continue to torment the Sithe Exalts, even after the war has come to
an end?” Ning mused to himself, “And this punishment is eternal
and unending… wouldn’t just killing them be easier? Why spend so
much time and effort in creating these formation-diagrams?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Or
perhaps… the Autarchs have plans of their own?” Ning mused. As he
pondered this question, he continued to draw closer to the Exalt.
Eight million kilometers. Five million kilometers. Three million
kilometers. Two million kilometers. One million kilometers…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t hesitate at all as he advanced. Although he was now within
the range of the Sithe Exalt’s attacks, he didn’t worry at all.
Even though he had the feeling that the Sithe Exalt was more powerful
than the Blazesun Ruler, Ning had outstripped the Blazesun Ruler in
both power and insight into the Dao. He was probably at the Autarch
level of power, and if it wasn’t for the fact that his truesoul was
continuously crumbling, Ning would’ve dared to actually take an
Autarch on in a sparring match. How could he possibly fear an
imprisoned Sithe Exalt?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The Sithe Exalt, seated in the lotus position with his head lowered,
finally let out a little snort. The gray armor covering his body
seemed rather rusted and old. He raised his head up, the curved horns
on his head looking wicked sharp as he glared intently at Ning. A
rumbling sound rang out from his throat: “You actually dare to
approach me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
wouldn’t I dare?” Ning continued to walk towards him, only
halting when he was roughly a hundred thousand kilometers away. At
this distance, the two were able to clearly see each other’s
features.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
You truly are someone who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao. Haha…
I, Dauber, feel admiration towards very few members of your
cultivator civilizations. You’ve just joined that list.” The
Sithe Exalt stared intently at Ning, his features occasionally
twitching from pain but his voice quite calm and steady. “A pity
that you failed the Daomerge. Death will be coming for you soon. A
true pity. You are the first member of your civilization to master an
Eternal Omega Dao, but you are about to die soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
there is life, there is death.” Ning smiled. “There’s no reason
to fear death, and death is far better than what awaits you. You
literally are living a life worse than death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
you.” The Sithe Exalt let out a low growl, his eyes flickering with
savage light. “Kill me, Daolord. Kill me. I know you have the power
to kill me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs must have imprisoned you for a reason. Why should I
interfere and cause trouble?” Ning shook his head. “Besides…
the Sithe are the mortal enemies of us cultivators. I am a Daolord
who has failed the Daomerge; if I was to kill you, I’d have to use
up my own lifespan. There is no relationship between the two of us
which would impel me to make such a sacrifice.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalt was intrigued. It seemed as though this terrifying
Daolord didn’t know why he had been imprisoned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Graaaaaah!”
The Sithe Exalt let out a short, ragged growl of pain. Clearly, he
was in a great deal of agony. A short while later, he suppressed the
agony and continued to speak: “We Sithe were defeated, true. This
was a war of civilizations, a war to the death; either you had to
die, or we would die! We lost the war, and I’m willing to accept
death as being the result of that. Why must you torment me like
this?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
just listened silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I, Dauber, had been free and up to my own devices, I never would’ve
wanted to launch such a cruel and deadly war. There was no way to
avoid this war; if you cultivators remained in power, then we Sithe
would’ve perished. That is why I HAD to take part in the war. Both
our sides suffered greatly in the war. Why must you feel such hatred
for me? Why must you torment me so?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
me. Grant me release. I’ve had enough of this endless torment.”
The Sithe Exalt Dauber stared intently at Ning, his eyes filled with
anticipation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but feel a sudden impulse to charge over and kill the
man, releasing him from his torment. However, Ning quickly regained
his usual calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was actually able to affect my thoughts?” Ning glanced at the Sithe
Exalt, secretly shocked. From a certain perspective, the Sithe was
telling the truth. Even Ning himself felt that wiping out the enemy
after winning the war was enough; there was no need to perpetually
imprison and torment the survivors. However, the reason why Ning had
felt that sudden impulse was primarly because the Sithe Exalt’s
voice had managed to bewilder him. This Sithe Exalt had definitely
reached a terrifyingly profound level in the art of bewilderment;
Ning had a truly perfect sword-heart, but he had still been briefly
influenced by the Exalt’s voice, even though he had quickly
recovered from it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
hint of disappointment flickered through the Sithe Exalt’s eyes. He
gritted his teeth and said resentfully, “Are you really not going
to grant me release?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs must have imprisoned you for good reason. They are the
leaders of the cultivator civilizations, and they could well have
done this because of some secret they know which has a major impact
on the war between our two civilizations. There’s no way I would
intervene,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit.
I was so close.” The Sithe Exalt Dauber instantly grew even more
berserk and growled, “This is unfair. UNFAIR! An Eternal Omega Dao?
If I had also embarked upon the path of the Omega Dao long ago, then
regardless of whether I succeeded or failed I never would’ve ended
up like this. My destiny would’ve been completely changed. This is
utterly unfair!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could feel the deep emotions which filled the man’s roar. It was a
feeling of deep and intense regret, mixed with resentment! Ning
couldn’t help but mumble to himself, “So what if you had embarked
upon the path of the Omega Dao? Even if you had embarked upon the
path of the Omega Dao, you still would’ve taken part in this war as
a member of the Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Suddenly, the growling Sithe Exalt reached out with both hands. His
arms expanded dramatically in size, causing even the
formation-diagram imprints on them to twist and distort. As he
attacked, he finally spat out a murderous, hate-filled cry: “If you
don’t help me, you can go die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two arms almost instantly expanded to become over a hundred thousand
kilometers long. His hands were filled with tremendous power, and he
reached out to tear Ning apart. As they swept out towards Ning, they
were infused with such strange, profound mysteries that Ning wasn’t
even able to dodge them; it seemed as though he absolutely had to
face this attack head-on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?!”
Ning turned ashen, and his heart shook with shock. Ever since he had
mastered an Eternal Omega Dao, he had always had a feeling that he
was in complete control of his surroundings. Every so often,
something would surprise him, but nothing truly caught him off-guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this moment, however, Ning truly felt stunned, so stunned that his
heart was shaking. Even his sword-heart had become rather unsteady.
It was as though he had seen something that was completely impossible
before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…”
Ning had no time to think this matter over, because those two giant
palms had already reached him.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_004__The"></A>
Chapter 4: Completely Stunned</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
but a thought, Ji Ning immediately summoned the awesome Sword Dao
domain around him. Countless streams of sword-light descended upon
this place, filling it with attacks that were all comparable to
full-strength blows from Otherverse Lords. The sword-light quickly
moved in a marvelous way to block the murderous palms that were
crashing down towards Ning, doing their best to slow the palms down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
of the fingers on the twin palms began to slowly change, as they
changed they caused spacetime to change with them. Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every single finger completely suppressed the streaks of sword-light
that they touched!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a truly ferocious attack from the Sithe Exalt. If Ning wished to
merely rely on his Sword Dao domain to defend against it, he would
have to use the principles of using ‘four grams of force to
redirect a thousand kilograms of power’. However, his opponent was
clearly at a far higher level of insight than the Blazesun Ruler was;
thus, Ning’s attempted block didn’t truly succeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
The twin palms appeared in front of Ning and then slammed straight
through Ning’s body, tearing it apart into two pieces. Ning’s
body gradually faded away into nothingness, followed by a white-robed
Ning reappearing over a million kilometers away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
fast!” Exalt Dauber immediately halted his attacks, because Ning
had already moved past his maximum attack range. Due to the
suppressive effects of the formation-diagram, he was only able to
launch attacks to this distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Eternal Omega Daos truly are impressive. I can’t help but envy his
incredible speed. It would’ve been wonderful if I managed to master
an Eternal Omega Dao.” Exalt Dauber couldn’t help but let out a
sigh. “To be honest, I knew I wouldn’t be able to kill you. I
just wanted to lessen your lifespan by a bit. Unfortunately, I wasn’t
even able to force you to draw your sword.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood a million kilometers away, a solemn look on his face. “I
didn’t draw my sword, but I had to use up a bit of divine power in
using that evasion-art.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eternal
Omega Daos were as profound as the Daos of ordinary Autarchs. Thus,
Ning actually had access to many truly incredible techniques,
techniques which one would naturally gain access to upon reaching
certain levels of insight. For example, when Ning had become a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, he had reached such a high level of
insight into the Dao of the Sword that he had gained natural mastery
over the ‘Shadowless form’, an invulnerable form. His Dao of the
Sword had gained the power to pierce through spacetime and sever
karma, and he had reached incredible heights in many different areas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nowadays,
Ning’s abilities were even more unbelievable than before. If he was
truly willing to exhaust his life energy, he could increase his speed
to truly unbelievable heights. For example, when Ning had killed the
Lonely King, he had taken a single step to move an extremely great
distance to slay the Lonely King without the latter even being able
to react! This was a testament to Ning’s true speed. Similarly, he
had been able to heavily injure the Blazesun Ruler with one strike,
and the Blazesun Ruler hadn’t been able to block at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
far as warping through spacetime went, if Ning chose to use his sword
to tear through spacetime, he would actually be able to travel a
greater distance than even the Blacksun was capable of! The Autarchs
were able to easily tear through spacetime and warp tremendous
distances… but alas, these incredible techniques all consumed
enormous amounts of energy. Ning had to be extremely stingy with his
energy usage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single scrap of energy and power represented his vital energy. Just
now, he had simply used an evasion-art to dodge a single step
backwards, ensuring that the Sithe Exalt wasn’t able to touch him.
This didn’t take up too much of his divine power, but it still
wasn’t nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe Exalt just attacked Daolord Darknorth!” The distant
cultivators and the creatures serving the Blazesun Ruler all stared
in astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalt’s attack was as savage and overbearing as ever. It was
strange. The Blazesun Ruler and the Sithe Exalt were clearly on the
same level of power, but when they saw the Sithe Exalt attack, they
felt a much greater sense of fear!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had already witnessed the Sithe Exalt attack on numerous occasions,
and several cultivators had died as a result. Daolord Darknorth,
however, was naturally different. He took just a single step back and
was able to dodge with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
side struck with full power, the other dodged with calm and unhurried
grace. Daolord Darknorth truly is more powerful!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incredible,”
the cultivators murmured. As for Nuwa, Su Youji, and the others who
were close to Ning? They only felt nervous. Given how fast Ning had
just moved, it was obvious that he had been forced to use some of his
own power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was only able to force you to use an evasion-art. How much energy
could that possibly consume? You’d probably have to use it to take
ten steps back in order to match the amount of energy you would use
up from a sword-strike,” Exalt Dauber said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face remained as solemn as ever. He stared intently at the Sithe
Exalt, as though he was trying to see through to some hidden truth.
After staring for several long seconds, Ning finally said, “The
claw-arts you just used…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahaha!
So you noticed, eh?” The Sithe Exalt laughed madly. “Ahaha, it
makes sense… you are someone who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao.
Of course you would be able to notice!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tell
me everything.” Ning stared at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
the only thing I’ll tell you is that you saw exactly what you
thought you saw.” The Sithe Exalt, Dauber, continued to laugh with
wild abandon. “I won’t tell you anything else, ahaha! I’ll let
you worry away and wrack your brains trying to find an answer. Hah!
I’m having fun just thinking about it. To be able to mystify the
very first master of an Eternal Omega Dao in this Chaosverse… what
a wonderful feeling!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned upon hearing this. The Sithe Exalt continued, “Unless…
you were willing to kill me and grant me release. Only then would I
tell you everything.” Exalt Dauber stared hungrily at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.”
Ning shook his head. After seeing the Sithe Exalt’s claw-arts, he
felt increasingly certain that there was an enormous secret behind
the Exalt’s imprisonment. The Autarchs had to have imprisoned them
for an extremely important reason.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
you will NEVER know the answer,” Exalt Dauber said viciously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tell
me… do you think the Autarchs know the answer?” Ning suddenly
smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
The Sithe Exalt was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go and ask the Autarchs. I was planning to visit them a final time
before dying anyhow,” Ning said. He then turned and left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Dauber gnashed his teeth as he watched Ning leave, but there was
nothing he could do. Use an illusion? That terrifying Daolord had an
incredibly powerful Dao-heart, one which was truly perfect. It was
already quite incredible that the Sithe Exalt had been able to have
even a slight effect on Ning earlier; there was no way he would
actually be able to actually influence Ning’s actions. Other
methods would be equally futile; there was no way such a major power
as Ning would succumb to the likes of mere curiosity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to be imprisoned here forever… tortured forever…” Dauber
raised his head, his azure eyes staring into the endless fiery light
in the skies. His gaze was filled with hatred and regret… and then
he mumbled with a hint of exhaustion, “When will it come to an end?
I really don’t want to hold on any longer…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned and left, returning to Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind and the others
with a belly full of suspicions. The images of the Sithe Exalt using
claw-arts to assault him continually replayed in his mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is it possible… how could that be? Is this the real reason why the
Autarchs have imprisoned them?” Ning continually pondered this
question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s face turned slightly pale as he raised his head and stared
towards the skies. Whoosh! A bolt of thunder suddenly appeared,
tearing through the heavens and warping through spacetime, causing a
stable but temporary passageway to form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment, eight towering figures appeared within the bolt of
thunder, with one being the muscular black-armored Blazesun Ruler.
The other seven all had different auras; one was as cold and remote
as an endless sea of ice, a second seemed to represent the
destruction of space itself… but all of them were of equal
magnitude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
eight Domain Rulers!!!” Ning’s face turned completely pale. “Have
they gone mad? The Blazesun Ruler must be insane!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had considered the possibility that the Blazesun Ruler might be able
to recruit four or five of the others to work with him, but he never
would’ve imagined that the legendary eight, the most powerful
Sourcewalkers of the Eight Domains of the Chaosverse, would all
appear en masse! All eight! Ning would probably exhaust himself and
die without being able to do anything to the eight of them; there was
simply no way he could fight at full-power for an extended period of
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
eight Domain Rulers?! B-but…” Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, and the
others were all shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
one over there is the Blazesun Ruler. Why is it that I have the
feeling that the other seven are just as terrifying as him? Their
auras seem to be of equal power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other seven are also Domain Rulers?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
The eight Domain Rulers are all here?!” Given that even Ning was
shocked, the other cultivators present were all completely scared
senseless. They had never even heard of all eight Domain Rulers
appearing at the same time!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
gone mad! Stark raving mad! All eight have rushed over right away?
I’m certainly not sticking around!” Ning took a single step
forwards and reappeared in front of Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, and the
others. He pulled them into his estate-treasure with a wave of his
hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
Ning brandished the Darknorth sword a single time, generating a
streak of sword-light that tore a rift through spacetime. Ning leaped
into that spacetime rift, which quickly closed and healed behind him.
By now, only the Autarchs could surpass Ning when it came to tearing
through spacetime. There was no way the eight Domain Rulers could
possibly stop him at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Domain Rulers had just used a valuable treasure to instantly
teleport here. They could do nothing but stare, stupefied, as Ning
disappeared from right in front of them… and they could find no
traces of where he had gone at all.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_005__The"></A>
Chapter 5: The Castle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ji Ning wished to, he could’ve used his sword to tear through
spacetime and let him exit the entire Blazesun Domain! However, as
one of the Eight Domains, there were many places within the Blazesun
Domain which were extremely hard to traverse via a spacetime warp; to
forcibly tear through via the Dao of the Sword would require an
enormous amount of energy. Ji Ning wasn’t willing to waste his
lifespan on something like this. He was able to sense that there was
something strange happening in spacetime nearby, and so he chose the
exit tunnel to be placed there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning vanished from the Earthfire Continent and followed the
sword-formed spacetime tunnel to arrive at an extremely distant place
within the Blazefire Domain. “Eh?” Ning swept the area with his
gaze, slightly surprised: “I sensed from afar that the spacetime
continuum here was quite unique. So this is what this place looks
like?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was currently standing in empty space, facing a distant dimensional
whirlpool. Battered bits of debris were flying out of the whirlpool,
including some shattered pieces of golden metal, strange mechanical
parts, and even an enormous but tattered-looking castle. These bits
and fragments were all flying out of the whirlpool, while the
whirlpool itself was starting to spin more slowly, almost as though
space was going back to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems my luck isn’t bad. I managed to find a Sithe trove after just
a single teleport,” Ning laughed. Ning waved his hand, releasing
Nuwa, Su Youji, Patriarch Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, the
Flamewing God, and the others. As soon as this awesome group of
experts appeared, they began to scan their surroundings. They quickly
noticed the dimensional whirlpool and were duly astonished by it and
the Sithe treasures floating out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Sithe treasure trove?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
actually a treasure trove here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And,
by the looks of it, it looks like it just appeared.” Patriarch
Treewind and the others were all quite stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he laughed. “I heard that otherverses and Sithe
treasuries will often appear out of nowhere within the Eight Domains.
Is that so?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is.” Patriarch Treewind nodded. “When wandering through the
Blazesun Domain, you’ll occasionally stumble across an otherverse
which has no owners in it, and Sithe caches will sometimes appear out
of nowhere as well. However, the ones we find have usually been
floating around in the Blazesun Domain for quite some time. I’ve
only heard stories about actually seeing them appear from dimensional
whirlpools; this is my first time witnessing it in person.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Otherverses
are created by Autarchs,” Ning said, “But the Sithe caches were
left behind from the Dawn War. Why would they appear here out of
nowhere?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
sure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs are probably behind this for some reason.” Patriarch
Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and the others who were familiar
with the Blazesun Domain all shook their heads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to ponder this question. The giant, battered-looking castle
off in the distance was in a more-or-less complete shape, but it had
clearly experienced the ravages of battle. Otherwise, why would it be
riddled with so many ‘wounds’? But it had been an extremely long
period of time since the Dawn War had ended. Why had it and all these
other treasures suddenly appeared now? Ning had only sensed that
something strange was happening in spacetime in this location while
he himself was warping through spacetime, which was why he had exited
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Over
the years, there had been other instances in the Eight Domains where
Sithe treasure caches had appeared out of nowhere. In fact, even Nuwa
had somehow vanished from the Three Realms and then appeared in the
Blazesun Domain!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
the otherverses… those were personally hand-crafted by the
Autarchs. Why would they appear here as well?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
we have an entire Sithe treasury in front of us!” Hegemon
Azurefiend was rather excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Nuwa remained quite calm, and she immediately asked, “Are the eight
Domain Rulers still in pursuit of us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. “Don’t worry, they aren’t able to track us down at
all. However… I really don’t understand what the eight of them
were thinking. I still can’t believe all eight of them joined
forces…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
probably have plans of their own.” Nuwa felt quite frustrated as
well. Anyone faced with all eight Domain Rulers at once would feel a
sense of tremendous pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
can keep searching if they want. I have no desire to waste my time on
them.” Ning didn’t wish to waste any of his vital energy;
otherwise, if he truly went all-out, he’d be able to dominate all
eight of them. All they would be able to do would be to endure his
attacks as best as they could, relying on their innate gifts; if they
managed to tank the hits, they would live, but if they failed they
would perish! Ning himself felt that if he was lucky, he would at
most be able to kill one of the eight if all eight joined forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
why? What was the point? Ning naturally preferred to stay far, far
away from the eight of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
let’s go take a look at those floating Sithe treasures.”
Flamewing stared quite curiously at the distant castle and the other
relics floating in space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth?”
Nuwa looked at Ning as well. She, too, felt curious about this
treasure cache.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord.”
All the others were also intrigued, but as they saw it, since Ning
had discovered this cache its contents would naturally belong to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and take a look.” Ning laughed. “Just be careful. Don’t
just rummage through things blindly; there might be traps hidden
there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Daolord. We’ll be careful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I’m going to go take a look as well.” Not even Su Youji could
refrain from taking a look. All of them flew towards the Sithe cache,
with only Protector Whitethaw continuing to solemnly stand guard over
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, the dimensional vortex had already vanished, allowing space to
go back to normal. Ning didn’t really care that much about the
Sithe treasury; he was already close to the Autarchs in power! Why
would he care about Sithe treasures or armaments?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
did I just see earlier, though?” Ning pondered by himself, his mind
thinking back to the Earthfire Continent and the sneak-attack the
imprisoned Sithe Exalt had launched against him. “It’s completely
impossible, but I can’t explain it any other way…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
this very moment, Ning still felt quite stunned by the implications.
This was also part of the reason why he had no interest in exploring
the Sithe treasure cache.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
definitely wasn’t seeing things. That imprisoned Sithe Exalt… it
had definitely reached the Autarch level of insight!” Ning was
shaking inside. That Sithe Autarch had probably reached Hegemony in
the Dao of Bewilderment, but the twin claw attacks he had launched
against Ning had been incomparably profound. Ning hadn’t been able
to disturb it or shake it at all with his Sword Dao domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Other
cultivators might not be able to tell, but Ning had already reached a
level of insight which was comparable to that of the Autarchs, and
had also received guidance from legacies left behind by Autarch
Awakener and Autarch Bolin. That brief moment of combat was enough
for Ning to ascertain that the Sithe Exalt, Dauber, had definitely
employed Autarchy-level mysteries in launching his twin claw attacks!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarch level of insight… that means he should be an Autarch!”
Ning simply didn’t understand. “B-but… he ended up being
imprisoned, just like that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he really was an Autarch, it would be incredibly easy for him and his
peers to capture the Flamewing God… but instead, three of them had
to work together to accomplish this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
fact, the Sithe once had multiple Exalts. If the Sithe Exalts truly
were Autarchs, they would’ve been able to overwhelm the cultivator
civilizations with ease… but instead, their performance in combat
proved that they were inferior to our Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
when Exalt Dauber battled against me… I could sense that although
he had reached an incredibly high level of insight, the power of his
attacks were vastly inferior to mine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
truly was puzzled. He felt certain that Sithe Exalt Dauber had
reached the Autarch level of insight, but the amount of power the
Exalt had unleashed in battle was much lower than that level; at
most, it was on par with the Blazesun Ruler’s. Ning had only been
forced to use a tiny bit of his energy, and a single backwards step
had allowed him to dodge the attack with ease. Clearly, Ning had
completely outstripped the Exalt in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
odd. There’s no way I was wrong; he has to be at the Autarch level
in insight, but for some reason he’s only able to unleash a
fraction of their power.” Ning mused to himself, “It felt as
though his techniques were only able to employ a tiny amount of the
power of the Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
major powers, the power of the Dao was paramount. The higher a level
of insight you reached, the more important the power of your Dao.
Ning, for example, was able to form a Sword Dao domain with just a
thought. He didn’t even need to use up any of his own energy, but
the domain would be filled with streaks of sword-light that were
comparable to full-strength strikes from Otherverse Lords! This was
the power of the Dao, not Ning’s own internal power! When he
himself fought in battle and used his sword-arts, his sword-arts were
so profound that they were capable of unleashing many marvelous
effects. This happened because he would use a fraction of his own
energy to fully command the power of the Dao and unleash even more
devastating amounts of might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
the Sithe Exalt was completely different. Ning could tell that he had
clearly reached the Autarch level of insight into the Dao, but his
techniques were only able to unleash a fraction of the Dao’s power.
As a result, the overall power of his attacks was merely at the
Blazesun Ruler’s level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what’s the reason for this? As far as I can tell, he should be an
Autarch… but he’s dramatically weaker than the Autarchs. Or
perhaps these Sithe Exalts are pseudo-Autarchs? Perhaps they have
inherently flawed Daos, which is why they are unable to unleash much
power from them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was filled with many questions. Why did these Exalts have such a high
level of insight into the Dao? Were they truly Autarchs, or were they
pseudo-Autarchs? Why was it that the true Autarchs did not kill them
and instead chose to torture them forever?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
imagine only the Autarchs know the answer to these questions,” Ning
mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth!
Hurry over here!” Nuwa suddenly called out from nearby that
distant, levitating castle.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_006__The"></A>
Chapter 6: Formation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong?” Ji Ning took a single step forwards and warped through
space, rippling through it to appear right next to the battered,
scar-covered castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa,
Patriarch Treewind, the Flamewing God, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and
the others all stood next to the castle, completely helpless. Nuwa
pointed at the giant castle, which was fully fifteen thousand meters
long. “We’ve already completely searched the place, and we’re
sure that there’s a dimensional space within it… but we haven’t
been able to open it up, no matter what we do, nor can we find a way
to get inside. This castle seems to be quite complicated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me take a look.” Ning scrutinized it carefully. The enormous castle
just hung there in space, covered with many scars and with a number
of damaged parts floating around it. Ning slowly flew in a circle
around the castle, inspecting every part of it with care. He also
took a look at the damaged parts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
does it look?” Flamewing couldn’t help but ask, “Master, are
you able to open it up?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if I was, you wouldn’t be able to do anything to it. Why are YOU in
such a rush?” Ning teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
just curious!” Flamewing chortled. In truth, Su Youji and the
others were quite curious as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to inspect the castle for as much time as was needed to
boil a kettle of tea. Suddenly, he waved his hand and caused two
distant fragments to fly into his hands. One was roughly three meters
long, while the other was merely fist-sized.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
Clack! Ning placed the two fragments into two different locations on
the castle. Rumble… instantly, the entire castle began to slowly
swivel on its base, which looked like a series of leaf-shaped
mechanisms. The center of this towering castle suddenly parted,
revealing an entrance way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
open! It’s open!” Flamewing said excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
you truly are impressive,” Hegemon Goodsong flattered. He was quite
skilled in this regard. Ever since he had become a Golden Emperor, he
had shamelessly chosen to follow Ning and flattered him nonstop. Ning
had been in need of someone who was familiar with the Blazesun
Domain, and so had nodded and accepted his service. Hegemon Goodsong
had done his utmost to serve as Ning’s pathfinder, and so Ning had
naturally decided to give him some tips from time to time. There were
countless Hegemons and Emperors who envied Hegemon Goodsong, but
alas… Ning wouldn’t accept a retainer without a good reason.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Sithe artifact seems to be usable… and generally speaking,
castle-shaped Sithe weapons are incredibly powerful,” Patriarch
Treewind said with praise. Due to the war, many powerful Sithe war
machines had ended up being completely destroyed or rendered
inoperable. The ‘Stone Hellephant Wall’ which Ning had once
discovered, which had originally been known as the Sithe warship
‘Tigerhill’, was one example of an unusable Sithe war machine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Sithe castle is probably comparable in value to Houwu City,”
Imperator Jade Rainbow agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed as well. It was generally quite easy to tell from just a
visual inspection as to how powerful Sithe weapons were. Chains,
axes, shields… these were held items that generally wouldn’t be
all that powerful! The Blacksun, Houwu City, the ‘Tigerhill’, and
this giant castle in front of them… these were all large-scale war
machines and generally were incredibly potent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
but a thought, Ning summoned his Sword Dao domain and used it to
completely cover the entire castle, as well as its internals.
“Nothing dangerous inside. Let’s go take a look.” Ning
immediately flew into the entrance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa,
Su Youji, Patriarch Treewind, and the others all followed Ning
inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
passageway was very deep, dark, and gloomy. From the outside, the
castle looked as though it was merely fifteen thousand meters long,
but on the inside it was absolutely enormous. Ning’s group flew
more than a thousand kilometers along the hallway before they finaly
reached an open, empty region. This region was divided up into three
different levels, with each level representing three different core
controls used to operate the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were Sithe corpses floating above the altars which existed in all
three levels. The corpses all emanated the auras of Eternal Emperors.
There were also some Black Emperors and Golden Emperors who had
undergone the Ritual Sacrificium; all of them had perished here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
slowly descended upon the bottommost layer, then glanced at his
surroundings. Nuwa and the others came flying over as well, also
landing on the altar at the very bottom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
insides of this castle are intact. How did they all die?”
Azurefiend glanced at the corpses in astonishment. “I don’t see
any wounds on these corpses.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Someone
managed to kill these Golden Emperors through the protection of the
castle.” Nuwa and the others were all quite stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
total of thirty-two Sithe are inside here,” Ning said. “It had to
have been an Autarch who used either karmic techniques or truesoul
destruction techniques to bypass the castle walls and slay the Sithe
inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs had chosen different Daos and thus had different areas of
specialty. Some, like Autarch Bolin, specialized in frontal attacks.
Others had techniques which were more mysterious and harder to
understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are actually three command centers.” Ning raised his head to look
at the other two, his forehead creased into a frown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
bottom command center has an enormous formation within it which can
be used to reach out from the base of the castle and connect it to an
enormous area around it! This castle can be used to command,
consolidate, and protect an entire region. It will gather chaos
energy from the area around it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
middle command center is comparatively simpler. It controls a
scanning formation, ensuring that any opponent who appears will find
it almost impossible to escape. It has tremendous control over
dimensional power, allowing it to scan an incredibly vast area and
discover even the most minute of spatial ripples. Even I would
probably be unable to avoid its detection,” Ning said with a
surprised sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
for the top command center… it is also quite complicated. It
involves a powerful offensive formation that gathers together the
power of lightning, focusing it together into an attack of incredible
power. Even Golden Emperors would probably perish before it,” Ning
said slowly as he continued to inspect the insides of the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
it really that impressive? That means this is a perfect weapon of
war,” Hegemon Azurefiend said with a shocked sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“During
the Dawn War, it was probably just as important as the Blacksun,”
Ning said. “This, too, is a war machine that is capable of
affecting the flow of battle in an entire region. I’m amazed that
we were lucky enough to stumble upon such an important war machine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
given your incredible prowess, Daolord, it is only natural that your
luck is also extraordinary,” Patriarch Treewind praised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
himself felt rather puzzled. Luck, eh? It was true that he was held
in high favor by the prime essences of the Chaosverse. When he had
failed his Daomerge, he could sense that the prime essences had
sighed on his behalf. If the reason that he had just stumbled upon an
incredibly valuable war-fort was because he was ‘lucky’ thanks to
being favored by the prime essences… even Ning could do nothing but
sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sithe
war machines of this level of power were incredibly hard to find.
Lord Houwu had only become known as the ‘Lord Governor of Houwu’
after finding Houwu City, while the Blacksun had made a ‘Realmslord’
out of Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
would need at least three people to take control of the formations in
order to operate this castle.” Ning frowned. “And all three need
to be Hegemons.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Me
and my avatar can account for two, but that won’t be enough.”
Nuwa felt rather worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
about me?” Azurefiend volunteered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “I’m planning to leave this castle in my
homeland. Azurefiend, are you really volunteering to stay in my
homeland forever?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was speechless. He loved freedom and loved adventuring. He really
wouldn’t be able to endure staying in Daolord Darknorth’s
homeland forever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
formations within this castle are quite complicated. Nuwa, you
probably wouldn’t be able to take direct control of them either,”
Ning said. “Let me take a closer look.” Ning was planning to
modify the central command centers of this castle, making it more
suitable for the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
himself was able to easily control all three formation-diagrams, but
modifying them even slightly would be difficult. Ning actually ended
up creating a fourth formation-diagram inside the castle, one which
would serve as the ‘master controls’. Thanks to this fourth
formation-diagram, a single Emperor would be able to simultaneously
control all of the castle’s functions. This took Ning over eight
hundred million years to accomplish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahah!
Finally, I’ve succeeded.” Ning let out a loud laugh, his laughter
echoing within the empty space. Nuwa, Su Youji, and the others who
had been quietly meditating all immediately stopped their training.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa,”
Ning said with a smile, “I added an additional formation-diagram
that simplifies the process of controlling this castle! Once the
castle has been activated, it will be able to scan to a distance of
over a trillion kilometers, and it’ll be able to stand guard over
this region. When I go back, I plan to modify the formations
protecting our homeland and make this castle the centerpiece of our
defenses. If anyone dares to attack our home, they’ll have to
endure an assault from the castle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
modifications have resulted in a decreasing in its scanning range,
and have also resulted in it only being able to focus its firepower
on a single target… but I think it should be enough,” Ning said.
“Besides, if we have enough Hegemons in the future, you can just
ignore my fourth formation-diagram and take direct control over the
three original ones.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Nuwa nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, causing a jade slip to appear with instructions on
how to control the castle. “Take it.” Ning handed the slip over
to Nuwa. “Test it out and see how strong it is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Nuwa scanned the slip, quickly memorizing the information.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go out,” Ning said, “And take a look at the castle’s power.”
The group of cultivators immediately left the castle, leaving only
Nuwa behind. They all stood outside in the void, staring at the
castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the very tip of the castle suddenly began to light up. BOOM! An
invisible dimensional ripple suddenly spread out to cover an area of
a trillion kilometers, making it so that nothing within this area
could escape its sensors.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_007__The"></A>
Chapter 7: Acting On Orders</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was a round disk located at the ‘neck’ of the castle, which was
divided into a black side and a white side. Flickers of terrifying
lightning could be seen gathering around that location. According to
the castle’s original configuration and power, it was capable of
shooting out two bolts of thunder simultaneously, each one carrying a
tremendous amount of power. In order to simplify the controls, Ji
Ning had made it so that just a single bolt of thunder could be
unleashed. However, this had the beneficial side effect of reducing
energy costs by 50%. Attacks of such power consumed enormous amounts
of energy, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
looks absolutely terrifying. I can sense that the power of that
thunder is more than enough to wipe me out,” Azurefiend said with a
sense of lingering fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?
Even I would find it hard to survive.” Patriarch Treewind felt fear
as well, as did Imperator Jade Rainbow and the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
types of Sithe war machines were absolutely terrifying. During the
Dawn War, they were used to stabilize entire regions; so long as an
Autarch didn’t intervene, these things spelled certain doom for any
cultivators who faced them! However, they had to build up power
before launching each shot, and so during the Dawn War the
cultivators who were faced with these terrifying war machines used
their own lives to ‘block’ their attacks and buy time for their
peers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A streak of lightning suddenly shot out, causing both space and time
to congeal into a liquefied state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
distant, fiery-red boulder which was levitating in the distance
suddenly disappeared, silently and soundlessly. The bolt of lightning
briefly showed itself as the boulder was destroyed, followed by it
immediately continuing its forwards surge. The power of this attack
was so great that everyone save for Ning and the Flamewing God felt
utterly stunned. This attack was more than enough to wipe them all
out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
attack was too fast. Space wasn’t just twisted, it was liquefied!
Anyone within a range of ten billion kilometers would find it almost
impossible to dodge,” Patriarch Treewind said with a frown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
only option would be to stay out of its range. In the future, I’ll
have to remember to stay at least fifty billion kilometers away from
that thing,” Imperator Jade Rainbow said with a laugh. “If I’m
too close, I won’t even be able to dodge. Treewind, your disciple
is now even more powerful than you are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa
has always been far more talented than me. Even without Daolord
Darknorth’s help, she would eventually grow to eclipse me in
might,” Patriarch Treewind chortled. Daolord Darknorth was
whole-heartedly helping out Nuwa, and Nuwa was his disciple. As a
result, Treewind himself would benefit from the process. The more
powerful this female disciple of his became, the more influential he
himself would become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The silver-robed Nuwa flew out from the castle. She waved her hand,
causing the castle to quickly shrink to become palm-sized and fall
within her palm. Clearly, she had already fully mastered the control
technique Ning had given her and was in full control of this castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is powerful. With this castle under my control, our homeland
shall be impregnable,” Nuwa said, her face covered with joy. “Given
how mighty its attacks are, its defensive prowess should be even
better. Even the likes of the Blazesun Ruler would find it difficult
to break through.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt delighted as well. After fleeing from the Earthfire Continent,
he had actually warped to this place and discovered a treasure that
he was in desperate need of! He had actually been planning to spend
some time finding a treasure which would be suitable for the Three
Realm’s defense; now, one had just appeared before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
this castle is still riddled with damage. What should we do?” Nuwa
looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing that can be done. I’m certainly not able to repair Sithe
artifacts,” Ning said with a laugh. “Thankfully, at least its
interior is in perfect shape. The damage on the outside makes it look
a bit ugly, but all we need to do is add another protective layer on
top and it’ll look as good as new.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly frowned and turned to stare off into the distant. Boom!
A faint dimensional ripple appeared, followed by a strange creature
with a sharp head and furry tail appear. It stared curiously in their
direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
creatures again?” Nuwa said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
thunderbolt you launched was probably so powerful it attracted their
attention. We’ve been discovered,” Patriarch Treewind said.
“These creatures seem quite weak; the strongest of them are perhaps
just barely comparable to ordinary Hegemons.” Patriarch Treewind
and the others naturally wouldn’t care too much about a squad of
such weak creatures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
these creatures are often under the Blazesun Ruler’s command,”
Imperator Jade Rainbow said hurriedly. “Now that they’ve seen
you, they’ll probably send word to the Blazesun Ruler and he’s
probably going to rush over here again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Ruler…” Ning felt resigned. There was nothing he could
do against the eight Domain Rulers. “Let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth!” A voice suddenly rang out, followed by the most
powerful of the tailed beasts flying towards Ning at high speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning glanced at the strange creature, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
name is Stoneblade.” The strange creature bowed respectfully, then
said, “My humblest greetings to the mighty Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
so you actually recognize me?” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Ruler long ago spread word that he is searching for you and
provided a great deal of information about you. When I also saw Nuwa
and Patriarch Treewind by your side, I naturally was sure that it was
you,” the creature said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Ruler certainly is persistent. It seems everyone has been
notified about me, including you and your peers. Speak. What do you
need from me?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
strange creature said respectfully, “The Blazesun Ruler sent word
long ago that if we encountered Daolord Darknorth, we were to
immediately inform you that they bear you no ill-will at all, nor do
they intend to fight you. Instead, there is something important they
must inform you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning was puzzled. “Something important? What is it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
I do not know. After discovering you, I immediately sent word back. I
imagine the Domain Ruler will soon be notified, and they’ll
probably hasten here at full speed. Once you see him you’ll know
the answer, Daolord,” the creature said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
strange creature then bowed respectfully a second time before
retreating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the Blazesun Ruler and the other Domain Rulers have important
business with you?” Nuwa was puzzled. “What important business
could it possibly be?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
it be a scheme of some sort?” Flamewing immediately asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. “Flamewing, when did you learn about ‘schemes’? Haha!
However, I don’t think it is a trick or a trap… because I’m
powerful enough that if I wish to leave, the eight of them are
completely unable to stop me. There’s no need to lie to me either!
And, when I saw all eight of them last time, I felt quite puzzled.
For all eight Domain Rulers to join forces against me is quite odd.
Now, it seems, they have other business with me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
shall wait here for a time. Let’s wait for the eight Domain Rulers
to come and see what they want,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
fled so quickly last time, I didn’t even have a chance to see what
the other seven looked like.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Me
neither.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
saw two of them. This time, I’m going to see what all eight of them
look like.” Hegemon Goodsong, Treewind, Jade Rainbow, Azurefiend,
and the others all felt quite relaxed. With Ning present, they had
nothing to fear at all. In any other situation, they would’ve been
utterly terrified by the prospect of facing the eight Domain Rulers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Roughly
an hour later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A bolt of thunder appeared, splitting through the void and creating a
temporary but stable spacetime tunnel. Eight figures appeared within
the tunnel. It was the Blazesun Ruler and the rest of the eight. When
they saw the distant Ning, they revealed looks of delight and
hurriedly flew towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really doesn’t seem as though they come with bad intentions,”
Nuwa sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
see just what they want, exactly. They have infinite lifespans and
should be living without any worries or concerns whatsoever. There
shouldn’t be anything they need me to do for them,” Ning said.
And of course, if they came for his ‘Eternal Omega Sword Dao’,
there was no way he would transmit it to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
the eight Domain Rulers arrived. They all shrank down to human size
as they met with Ning and his team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Daolord Darknorth.” All of them spoke quite courteously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Domain Rulers.” Ning smiled. “Last time I saw you,
Blazesun Ruler, you were thirsting for battle and completely mad with
bloodlust. This time, all eight of you have appeared but are so
courteous… and I hear there is something important you wish to tell
me? Might I ask what that is?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Domain Rulers traded a glance. The Blazesun Ruler voluntarily
stepped forward and said, rather embarrassed, “Daolord Darknorth, I
was rash in my actions. As soon as we fought, I immediately knew that
I was no match for you. A while ago, when we came to speak to you at
the Earthfire Continent, it wasn’t for the sake of continuing the
fight. Rather, we came on orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
orders?” Ning was startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
A Sourcewalker dressed in deep blue armor respectfully replied,
“After you appeared in the Blazesun Domain, word of your presence
quickly made its way to the Autarch. The Autarch is within the
Quintessence of the Chaosverse and is too busy to come out, and so
she instructed the eight of us to find you and bring you to meet with
her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been searching for you this entire time. Last time, we found you, but
you left so quickly that we weren’t able to catch up,” a
Sourcewalker dressed in fiery armor said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was enlightened. “The Autarch is located amongst the prime essences
and wishes to meet with me? Might I ask, which Autarch is it?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_008__The"></A>
Chapter 8: Entering the Quintessence</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler said hurriedly, “It is Autarch Skyfeeder. Ever since
the war against the Sithe concluded, the Autarch has spent almost all
of her time within the Quintessence of the Chaosverse. We were lucky
enough to have received some guidance from her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skyfeeder?”
Ji Ning nodded slightly. The only Autarchs he knew of were Autarch
Bolin, Autarch Awakener, and Autarch Titanos. He didn’t really know
much about the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and lead the way,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord…”
The Sourcewalker dressed in deep blue armor glanced rather hesitantly
at the many cultivators behind Ning. “The Autarch is within the
prime essences, a place filled with tremendous power. There is no way
ordinary cultivators can enter there! You need to have either reached
the incredible level of the Autarchs, which you Daolord have, or be
like us and the Chaos Primordials. We’re able to endure the power
of that place with our powerful bodies. Weaker cultivators are
completely incapable of moving about within the prime essences. I’m
afraid that we would at most be able to bring you and your Chaos
Primordial.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry about us at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarch wishes to see YOU, Daolord. We wouldn’t dare go,”
Patriarch Treewind, Azurefiend, and the others said hurriedly. They
had all but stopped breathing when they heard that an Autarch had
summoned Ning. How could they possibly dare to get involved in a
meeting between Daolord Darknorth and such a supremely august
presence?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
go ahead and go. Don’t worry about us,” Nuwa concurred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning nodded. Even if he did bring them, there was no way for
them to move about inside the prime essences. “Stay here within the
Blazesun Domain. Once I return, I’ll reunite with you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Su Youji and the others hurriedly assented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you must be careful,” Nuwa instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry.” Ning smiled. The eight Domain Rulers wouldn’t dare to
cause trouble, which meant that Nuwa’s team of cultivators had
nothing to fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
me with you, Master! Take me with you!” Flamewing said eagerly.
“It’s been forever since I was back inside the prime essences!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed and nodded. “Very well. Follow me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
way please, Daolord Darknorth.” The Blazesun Ruler took out his
warship and invited Ning and Flamewing inside. Moments later, the
warship tore through spacetime and disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Domain Rulers used all the considerable tools at their
disposal. Just three days later, they exited the Blazesun Domain and
entered a silent, empty region of space. There was a total of ten
people in this group, and they all stood there within the empty
region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Sithe warship is useless once we go inside the prime essences. Once
we go inside, we’ll have to slowly fly on our own,” the Blazesun
Ruler explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Open
up!” One of the Domain Rulers stepped forward and made a slashing
motion with his hand. Swoosh! A gateway was torn within spacetime,
and at the opposite end of the gateway was a region filled with an
incredible, awesome amount of power and energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
you, Daolord,” the eight Domain Rules said very respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning was the first to step into the spacetime door, with
Flamewing and the eight Domain Rulers following from behind. After
they entered, the spacetime door vanished without a trace, leaving
behind a very ordinary-seeming region. Ordinary cultivators who came
here, including Otherverse Lords, were completely incapable of
finding the prime essences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
region they entered was filled with overwhelming power. Imagine a
mortal falling into an ocean; the entire area around him would be
surrounded by endless waves of suffocating might. The pressure from
these waves could easily cause even Hegemons to perish, while
Otherverse Lords would find it too difficult to take as much as a
single step here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Domain Rulers and the Flamewing God were all under tremendous
pressure as well. They had powerful bodies and thus were able to
endure it, especially Flamewing whose body was virtually
indestructible and who could thus completely ignore the pressure.
However, they still had to use all the power they could muster in
order to advance through this region. Thankfully, Flamewing had such
an endless source of power that this wasn’t of concern.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Which
way shall we go?” Ning was the most relaxed of the ten. The Sword
Dao domain emanating from him was enough to cause the surrounding
pressure to instantly vanish without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because the Dao of his Sword Dao domain was the same as the prime
essence of the Dao of the Sword. The prime essence of the Dao of the
Sword was naturally part of the collection of prime essences, and so
Ning was able to move through this region as easily as a fish moving
through water. He didn’t suffer any pressure or sense of rejection
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unfortunately,
Ning wasn’t able to protect anyone else. The power of the prime
essences was omnipresent, while the prime essence of the Dao of the
Sword was merely one part of them. If Ning pulled Flamewing and the
others into his estate-world, they would be protected. Otherwise,
they would simply have to endure it on their own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
follow us, Daolord,” the Blazesun Ruler said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you feel tired, you can rest inside my estate-world for a time,”
Ning said with a chuckle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry about us, Daolord. We’re used to this place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
this bit of pressure is nothing at all, Master!” The eight Domain
Rulers and Flamewing continued to advance rapidly, but they were all
using their full power to do so. As for Ning, he was able to
effortlessly follow from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
scanned at his surroundings. The Quintessence itself was like a place
that was divided into many different ‘lakes’, with each lake
representing a prime essence. He saw the prime essence of thunder,
the prime essence of water, the prime essence of ice, the prime
essence of the Dao of the Sword… every single prime essence was
here and overflowing with might. Through them, Ning was able to more
clearly scry some of the secrets of the various Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
prime essence of the Dao of the Sword was nothing more than one of
many prime essences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the true foundation of our entire Chaosverse,” Ning murmured
softly. “Even I am only able to control a tiny part of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them flew very fast, but even so it took them a full five days
before they flew past the many different prime essences. Finally,
they arrived at an ordinary-looking wooden cottage that was floating
in midair. There was a small courtyard surrounding this wooden
cottage which looked rather like a small crop field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Looks of delight appeared on the faces of all eight Domain
Rulers. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! They hurriedly flew closer, stepping
into the courtyard around the wooden cottage. Ning and Flamewing
followed them from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Invisible
barriers had been placed here which kept out the natural pressure of
the Quintessence. Only now did everyone finally relax.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a marvelous formation.” Ning scanned the formation, then let out a
sigh of approval. A formation capable of completely blocking out the
pressures of the Quintessence is impressive indeed. Ning then glanced
at the surrounding area. He could sense that no one was here aside
from them. He immediately turned to the Blazesun Ruler and asked,
“Where is the Autarch?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a place where the Autarch often rests,” the blue-armored
Sourcewalker said. “She’s cultivating nearby. As soon as we
entered her residence, she would be immediately notified. She’ll be
coming soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivating
nearby?” Ning glanced at the area around them. “Eh?” Soon, Ning
was able to detect a strange ripple of power emanating from a place
off in the distance. This was a temporal ripple, and it contained
utterly savage levels of power. It was almost like a terrifying
apocalyptic demon that sought to devour all before it. Ning couldn’t
help but turn slightly pale; how was it possible that ‘time’
itself could become so terrifying?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the ripples quickly calmed down. A short while later, an ephemeral
figure began to drift towards them, quickly leaving the prime
essences and arriving in front of the wooden cottage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a willowy woman whose features Ning wouldn’t describe as
exceptionally beautiful. In the Three Realms, her features would be
considered quite common and ordinary. Her face was slightly plump,
her gaze was gentle, and her aura was both awesome and mysterious,
tinged with the ripples of time. Time itself was like an obedient
child which swirled around her. She was the only female Autarch in
all the Chaosverse… Autarch Skyfeeder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
greets you, Autarch,” Ning said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder walked barefoot into her courtyard, then smiled merrily at
Ning and said, “Skyfeeder greets you, Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
spoke quite courteously. As soon as they glimpsed each other, they
were able to sense the level of insight the other had reached.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense how tremendously powerful this Autarch’s ‘Temporal
Daobirth Essence’ was, while the Autarch was able to sense how
incredible Ning’s ‘Eternal Omega Sword Dao’ was. They had
embarked upon different paths, but they had now reached the same
heights of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder and the other Autarchs had all first become Hegemons after
fusing multiple Supreme Daos together, then broke through to become
Autarchs!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had embarked upon the path of the Omega Dao, and he had eventually
come to master the Eternal Omega Sword Dao. Although strictly
speaking he was still just an ‘Eternal Emperor’, he truly had
reached the same heights of insight as the Autarchs possessed; his
only weakness was that the breadth of his understanding wasn’t
quite as wide. In actual combat, however, their blows would be
incredibly close to each other in might… but of course, as someone
who failed the Daomerge, Ning wasn’t able to fight for too long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
let’s chat inside,” Autarch Skyfeeder said. She pushed the door
to the wooden cottage open. The cottage was quite plain, with a few
seams appearing between the wooden logs that allowed one to clearly
see what was inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder sat down on the ground in front of a table. Ning did the
same in front of another table. Each table had a flagon of wine, and
the fragrant aroma of the wine instantly caused Ning’s eyes to
light up. This was, without a doubt, the finest wine he had ever
seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the two of them were merely separated from the eight Domain Rulers
and Flamewing by a thin wooden door, the nine were completely unable
to hear a word of the conversation within.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_009__The"></A>
Chapter 9: The Autarchs</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ji Ning smelled the aroma of the wine, he couldn’t help but pour
himself a cup and taste it first. He then nodded and sighed happily,
“What fine wine. My soul itself is uplifted by it; in fact, I can
sense that even the disintegration of my truesoul slowed down for a
brief instant.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
the disintegration of the truesoul is irreversible.” Autarch
Skyfeeder slowly poured herself a cup, her voice tinged with regret.
“Otherwise, our civilization would have given birth to a truly
incredible figure. To tell you the truth, your rise is far more more
important to our civilization than the rise of a new Autarch. You
are, after all, the very first who truly mastered an Eternal Omega
Dao. Sadly…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can only blame myself for not having trained well enough,” Ning
said with a laugh. “Perhaps if I was just a bit better, I would’ve
succeeded in the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
path is always the most perilous for the first trailblazer,”
Autarch Skyfeeder said. “There has never been anyone who has
mastered an Eternal Omega Dao before you, and so there were no
guideposts or experiences you could draw upon. If you did, you
probably would’ve succeeded in the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was startled. Indeed. He had been so very, very close. If he had just
a few extra months worth of time, he probably would’ve been able to
find the flaws during his Daomerge and he would’ve been able to
discover the true Eternal Omega Sword Dao before it ended. Alas, he
had wasted three entire years on perfecting his sword-heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
let out a chuckle. “Well, there always has to be a trailblazer. To
serve as the trailblazer for the Eternal Omega Daos isn’t a bad
destiny to have.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder smiled and nodded. “I just heard about you a short while
ago. When I found out you were in the Blazesun Domain, I immediately
sent the eight Domain Rulers out to search for you. I have something
important to discuss with you, something which involves the very
existence of all cultivator civilizations in the Chaosverse. We need
your help.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
involving the very existence of the cultivator civilizations?” Ning
was startled. This sounded serious. “Is there something which is
capable of threatening us?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is indeed.” Autarch Skyfeeder nodded. “Just now, I informed the
other Autarchs of your arrival. They are all hastening here as fast
as they can. When the others arrive, we’ll discuss this matter. It
is a blessing that the cultivator civilizations have finally given
birth to someone who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao.
Unfortunately, you failed the Daomerge. If you had succeeded, we
would be even more overjoyed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other Autarchs?” Ning was rather shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivator civilizations currently have a total of six surviving
Autarchs. One of them is permanently stationed in front of the
Sithelands and won’t be able to make it. The other four will all be
coming,” Autarch Skyfeeder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. Six Autarchs in total, with five of them coming to
meet him. This was indeed a weighty affair they wished to discuss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos’ residence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos was almost always secluded away within his private chambers,
analyzing the marvelous parts and artifacts which floated in the
center. “Huh?” Suddenly, Autarch Titanos’ face turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“WHAT?!?!”
The two fleshy antennae on top of Autarch Titanos’ head suddenly
stood up straight, and his golden eyes bulged out. “An Eternal
Omega Dao? Someone from our civilization has finally mastered an
Eternal Omega Dao?!” Autarch Titanos was truly stunned. “And his
name is… eh? Darknorth? Wasn’t that kid I saw a while ago also
named Darknorth? Back then, he had merely improved his Omega Dao to
the level of a Daolord of the Fourth Step. He actually mastered an
Eternal Omega Dao?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is huge! How did it happen that the old biddy Skyfeeder actually
ended up being the one to find out and notify me?!” Autarch Titanos
completely ignored the Sithe artifacts floating around in his room.
He immediately charged outside in a fine rage, slamming open the door
with a boom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The azure-robed youth immediately moved to welcome him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“XIAN!”
Autarch Titanos said furiously, “Have you heard about the Daomerge
of that kid who once asked me for help? Daolord Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heard?
Of course I heard.” The azure-robed youth nodded repeatedly. “This
was major news which quickly spread everywhere! He failed his
Daomerge, but he still managed to master an Eternal Omega Dao. Even
the Lonely King of the Icepeak Army was killed by a single slash of
his sword. He went out searching for Nuwa, and Realmslord Windgrace
did everything in his power to help spread the word. He even asked us
to help out! I told quite a number of my friends about this. By now,
I imagine the major powers in most of the realmverses and otherverses
all know about him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“BUT
I DIDN’T KNOW!” Autarch Titanos stared at him, eyes bulging. “Why
the hell didn’t you tell MEEEE!!!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
A baffled and miserable look was on the azure-robed youth’s face.
“Master, didn’t you forbid me from disturbing you while you were
analyzing those Sithe weapons unless something really big happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
IS big! This is literally BIGGER THAN ANYTHING ELSE!” Autarch
Titanos exploded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth failed his Daomerge. He’ll probably die soon, leaving
behind nothing more than a legend. Why would this be ‘big news’
to you, Master?” The azure-robed youth was completely puzzled. To
him and the other Hegemons, this was a stunning piece of gossip, but
in the end it was nothing more than that – gossip. He didn’t feel
there was a need to bother the Autarch over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
the love of…” Autarch Titanos felt helpless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were six Autarchs in total. One was permanently stationed in front of
the Sithelands and thus didn’t know of Ning. The other four were
almost impossible for Hegemons to find, which was why they didn’t
know of Ning even though Ning’s legend had long ago spread far and
wide amongst the Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only Autarch who was in fairly constant contact with the Hegemons and
Emperors was Autarch Titanos, but he had been researching in
seclusion and his subordinates didn’t dare to disturb him. As a
result, he didn’t find out either. It wasn’t until just a short
while ago that the Autarchs found out about Ning, with Autarch
Skyfeeder who was located within the Quintessence being the first to
find out. She had notified the other Autarchs, and only then did they
realize what had happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…forget
it.” Autarch Titanos shook his head. “I’ve really embarrassed
myself this time. I am usually the first to find out about things,
but this time I was the last.” As he spoke, he waved his hand and
immediately warped through spacetime and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
couldn’t help but feel angry. The Autarchs had agreed long ago to a
division of labor, and Autarch Titanos had agreed to be the one
responsible for maintaining contact with the Hegemons and Emperors;
he was to serve as a the bridge linking the Autarchs to the rest of
civilization. If anything major happened amongst the Hegemons and
Emperors, news of it would quickly make its way over to him, and he
would then notify the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
time, the news involved the rise of someone who controlled the
Eternal Omega Sword Dao. This was news of incredible importance…
but he ended up being the notified party rather than the notifying
party. Of course he felt humiliated by this!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
empty, barren region. The stars and chaosworlds here seemed to have
sunken into the silence of death. This entire region, which was the
size of dozens of territories, was completely and utterly still. No
life could rise here, nor would anyone dare to draw near here! If
Hegemons did dare to draw near this place, they would sense the
terrifying power of death seep into their bodies… and if they came
any closer, they would die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, this region was in a perpetual state of death and silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was an enormous planet here that was roughly a hundred billion
kilometers in diameter. This entire planet was a dark gray color, and
an incredibly dense aura of death surrounded the entire planet. This
planet was the source of the deathly energy which pervaded this
entire region, and even the stones here had been completely broken
apart into countless grains of dark gray sand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the earth began to tremble, and the endless aura of death began to
change. The ground slowly began to turn fertile and full of life.
Soon, countless blades of green grass began to appear on the surface
of the earth as the power of life began to emanate from this planet,
and the aura of death that surrounded this region slowly began to
dissipate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rain
began to fall from the skies, resulting in rivers, lakes, and seas
appearing. The earth began to change, with mountains and valleys
taking shape. Vegetation began to grow rapidly, with prairies and
forests appearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
transformation from utter death to brimming life happened in just a
single breath’s worth of time! In this single instant, time itself
seemed to have somehow twisted. An incredibly long period of time
seemed to have gone past, more than enough time to allow this place
to become brimming with life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A figure suddenly appeared on the surface of this planet. A sorrowful
look was in his eyes, and he slowly shook his head. “I trained for
very long this time. Why is it so difficult to gain insight into a
Daobirth Essence from the line that separates life from death? If I
mastered an additional Daobirth Essence, there would probably be a
new transformation. Ugh. I failed yet again. Perhaps cultivators are
only capable of mastering a single Daobirth Essence? Perhaps all the
efforts of myself, Bolin, are for naught?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
Skyfeeder just sent some good news. It seems our civilization has
finally given birth to someone in control of an Eternal Omega Dao.
His name is Daolord Darknorth, eh? A pity, truly a pity… how
wonderful would it be if he had succeeded in his Daomerge? Still, no
matter what, at least he has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao.” He
took a single step forwards, causing space to ripple around him, then
vanished without a trace.</P>

Chapter 10: The Autarchs Gather</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the sea of the prime essences of the Chaosverse. Inside the wooden
cottage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning and Autarch Skyfeeder were seated in the lotus position. They
were going to patiently wait for the other Autarchs before talking
business. While waiting, Ning began to discuss the Dao and its myriad
mysteries with Autarch Skyfeeder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Over
two hours went past in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
A thunderous laugh rang out, followed by the door swinging open and a
muscular man dressed in loose green robes walking in. He had a pair
of curved horns on his head, and his eyes were like an endlessly dark
abyss. He emanated an aura of terrifying pressure that caused Ning to
feel shocked, and his palms were quite large and thick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” The muscular man smiled when he saw Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
this would be Autarch Ekong,” Autarch Skyfeeder introduced with a
smile. “He is the only Autarch who rose from our civilization after
the Dawn War against the Sithe concluded. He was incredibly talented
and rose to become a Hegemon in a very short period of time. He
caused quite a stir in his youth, and he has a rather special title –
he is known as the Autarch of Annihilation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
actually a fairly nice guy and I rarely kill people, but my path was
that of the Destruction Daobirth Essence. That’s why I’m known as
the ‘Autarch of Annihilation’,” the muscular Autarch Ekong said
with a booming laugh. “You can just call me Ekong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ekong,
hurry up and sit down,” Autarch Skyfeeder said. “Sit and chat
with us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t help it! I’m so happy to meet Daolord Darknorth. Our
civilization has finally given birth to a master of an Eternal Omega
Dao.” Autarch Ekong sat down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but secretly sigh in approval. Every Autarch truly
was an extraordinary figure. For example, Ning felt as though Autarch
Skyfeeder was a transcendent figure that was quite unlike ordinary
living beings; she was like the mother of all things who benevolently
watched over all creation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Autarch Ekong, he emanated a heroic aura that was tinged with a
terrifying, all-encompassing dominance that whispered of a hidden
potential for destruction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ekong,
you little drakeling! I can’t believe you actually got here faster
than me.” The door swung open once more, followed by a bald,
black-robed old man walking in with a smile on his face. The two
fleshy antennae on his head twirled around, seemingly quite
delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
man, can you knock it off with the ‘little drakeling’ thing? Just
because you started training a bit earlier than me…” Autarch
Ekong said helplessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
your own fault for calling me ‘old man’.” Autarch Titanos gave
him a ‘hard’ look, then turned and beamed at Ning. “Darknorth,
my young friend… we meet again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Autarch Titanos.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
met?” Autarch Skyfeeder and Autarch Ekong were both surprised.
Autarchs were quite hard to meet, and Ning had only trained for a
fairly brief period of time. They had thought that Ning had never met
with any Autarchs before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes
indeed. My young friend Darknorth once asked me to help him reverse
spacetime to revive his Dao-companion.” Autarch Titanos let out a
sigh. “Alas… the chaosworld his Dao-companion resided within was
a world that was created from the godgems left behind by ol’
Awakener after he died. In fact, it was a world created from TWO
godgems that collided together. I’d probably kill myself trying to
bring her back to life, and it still probably wouldn’t work.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Skyfeeder
and Ekong were both startled. As for Ning, he fell silent for a
moment before letting out a chuckle: “What’s past is past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let me offer you a toast.” Ekong lifted up his wine cup. “I’ve
had quite a few Dao-companions in the past and thus have experienced
the travails involved in reversing spacetime to bring them back.
Thankfully, my Dao-companions resided in a mundane chaosworld, making
reviving them much easier. I was a bit luckier than you, I suppose.
Let’s drink together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lifted up his own cup and drank some of the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t expect that you would actually have a connection to
Awakener, Darknorth.” Autarch Skyfeeder let out a sigh. “Awakener
was tremendously talented and was actually one of the first Autarchs
to rise to power. The only one remaining from the oldest days is you,
old man Titanos.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
because I’m not tired of living yet!” Autarch Titanos stared at
her. “But you, Skyfeeder… you’ve trained for a shorter period
of time than me. Are you thinking of taking the same route which
Awakener and Entropos took?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are no other paths to take. That was the same conclusion they came
to. However… thankfully, our civilization has finally given birth
to someone like Daolord Darknorth, a master of an Eternal Omega Dao.
As a result, I can relax a bit and won’t rush off to give it a
try.” Autarch Skyfeeder smiled as she glanced at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but ask, “Awakener and ‘Entropos’; who were
they?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Two
other old fellows,” Autarch Titanos chortled. “The three of us
were the originals, the ones who lived the longest – Entropos,
Awakener, and myself! A great deal of time passed before Skyfeeder
and the others made their breakthroughs. Alas, Awakener and Entropos
have already died.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Both
of them died? How did they die?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos, Autarch Skyfeeder, and Autarch Ekong exchanged a glance.
Autarch Titanos then let out a chuckle and said, “Darknorth, my
young friend, don’t be impatient. We’ll discuss this matter
later, and I’m sure you’ll come to understand. This actually is
connected to the reason why we need your help. Let’s wait for the
other two to arrive. Actually… hah! They’ve already arrived.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all turned to look towards the outside. The seams
between the wooden logs were quite large, allowing one to clearly see
what was going on outside. Right now, two figures were walking
side-by-side towards the cottage. These were the two remaining
Autarchs of the five who were meeting today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Domain Rulers and the Flamewing God continued to wait outside
in the courtyard, their eyes growing wider and wider. “They just
keep coming…” they mumbled breathlessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single person who came was an Autarch. Each time, the nine could
sense that invisible aura of might and pressure. Even the normally
brash Flamewing was now on his absolute best behavior.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Two
more Autarchs?” Flamewing and the others all stared as two figures
emerged from the sea of prime essences and walked into the courtyard.
The two glanced at the eight Domain Rulers and Flamewing but didn’t
say a word, simply walking straight inside the cottage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Five
Autarchs.” Flamewing muttered to itself, “What do these five
Autarchs want from my master?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been alive for an eternity, but I’ve never seen five Autarchs
together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
I have only seen three of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Five
Autarchs have gathered together. How rare must this be?!” The eight
Domain Rulers were all speechless. Autarchs were incredibly hard to
find; even during the Dawn War against the Sithe, the Autarchs had
commanded separate troops of Hegemons. Some of the eight Domain
Rulers had taken part in this war, but none of them had seen all of
the Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
eight of the Domain Rulers and Flamewing stared towards that wooden
cottage with curiosity. That ordinary looking cottage actually held
five Autarchs and a Daolord who was the first person in the
Chaosverse to master an Eternal Omega Dao. All nine of them were
curious… what was being discussed inside?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Inside
the room. The two final Autarchs walked in alongside each other, and
Ning couldn’t help but smile when he saw them. Compared to Autarch
Ekong or Autarch Titanos, Ning could be considered quite handsome.
Even Autarch Skyfeeder wasn’t all that attractive… but the final
two Autarchs who had just arrived were both ravishingly handsome men
of empire-toppling beauty. Ning could use every single superlative in
his vocabulary to describe their appearance, and it would all be
completely justified.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
one on the left had white hair. He had a rather tired aura and his
face was unshaven, but he was without a doubt a truly handsome man.
He seemed to be walking the line between life and death; he seemed
like the font of all life, but he also seemed like the final resting
place of the dead. All living creatures would feel an uncontrollable
sense of yearning towards him… but of course, major powers like
Ning wouldn’t be affected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the one on the right, he was an incomparably noble figure. He had
black hair, bore a smile on his face, and seemed to be a truly
perfect person. Even someone whose Dao-heart was incredibly strong
like Ning couldn’t help but feel somewhat attracted to this man,
who seemed to embody the very essence of beauty itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is Bolin.” Autarch Titanos pointed at the tired-looking
white-haired man, then smiled: “This fellow has been ruminating on
life and death, or something like that. That’s why he looks so
terrible. When I first met him, he was quite a dashing and imposing
figure. He’s the master of the Claw Daobirth Essence, but now he
looks like this… tsk!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Autarch Bolin looked at Ning, rather startled. “The two of us are
actually connected by karma?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is indeed some karma between us,” Ning said with a laugh. “Autarch
Bolin… you don’t know me, but I actually benefited through your
actions. That Chaos Primordial outside? I actually tamed it due to
the verdant azuresoul you left behind in one of your beastworlds,
Autarch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
A hint of a smile appeared on Autarch Bolin’s face. “Yes, long
ago I did in fact leave behind quite a few estate-worlds throughout
the Chaosverse. I was worried that we would lose the final battle and
wanted to ensure that the seeds of rebirth and resistance would be
planted for our civilization. However, we ended up winning, making
the estate-worlds of limited use. I stopped paying attention to them
as a result. I didn’t expect that they would end up helping you
out, Daolord Darknorth. It seems my work wasn’t wasted after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a sense of tremendous admiration for Autarch Bolin. Autarch
Bolin clearly walked the path of the Claw Daobirth Essence, but he
had reached such incredible heights in the Dao of Life that he had
been able to create an entire race… the race of Aeonians!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_011__The"></A>
Chapter 11: The Source Of Everything</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning had just heard Autarch Titanos say that Autarch Bolin was
studying the secrets of life and death, which was why his aura had
changed so dramatically. Based on this, Ning surmised that the
Aeonians probably represented certain accomplishments Autarch Bolin
had reached in understanding the mysteries of life. What, then, were
his accomplishments in the mysteries of death? And… why was an
Autarch even researching the principles of life and death?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
this gentleman is Stonerule.” Autarch Bolin pointed at the
perfectly beautiful man next to him and chuckled, “Stonerule become
an Autarch via the Dao of Illusions. His divine body is filled with
boundless magnetism and charm. Those of us who have perfect
Dao-hearts aren’t affected too much, but Hegemons and Otherverse
Lords who run into him would be instantly charmed and would willingly
do whatever he commanded.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusions?”
Ning was shocked. So Autarch Stonerule’s path was that of the
Illusion Daobirth Essence? How impressive!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Daolord Darknorth.” Autarch Stonerule smiled. “My
little parlor tricks are nothing to you, Daolord. We have been
waiting a long, long time for someone to finally master an Eternal
Omega Dao, but we never knew when it would finally occur! Very few
can even become Daolords of the Fourth Step through an Omega Dao,
while the Daomerge for one would be even more incomparably
difficult!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
truly was hard.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
you failed, Daolord, you still managed to master an Eternal Omega
Dao. This truly is a blessing for our civilization,” Autarch
Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you, sit down. Look at how antsy you all are,” Autarch Skyfeeder
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin and Autarch Stonerule immediately sat down. Now, all five
Autarchs and Ning were all seated. Ning felt a sense of anticipation.
He knew that it was finally time to discuss business.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Shall
I go first?” Autarch Titanos swept the others with a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead, old man,” Autarch Ekong said. The other Autarchs all nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos looked straight at Ning. “Darknorth, by now you should be
aware that the Sithe have not been truly exterminated, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
haven’t been truly exterminated?” Ning was astonished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
didn’t know?” Autarch Titanos was rather surprised. “Haven’t
you visited the legendary Sithelands?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
heard of the Sithelands but haven’t visited them yet,” Ning said.
The Sithelands were indeed quite famous. Ning had heard Emperor
Waveshift speak of them and had discussed them with several major
powers. The Sithe had arisen from that place, and to this very day it
held more Sithe treasures than any other place. Major powers often
went there to go adventuring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Weren’t
the Sithe exterminated after losing the war?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos chuckled. “I would’ve assumed that after you failed the
Daomerge, you would’ve gone to visit as many of the famous places
in the Chaosverse as you could prior to dying. I thought you visited
the Sithelands already. If you had… given your current level of
insight, you probably would’ve seen the truth. You would’ve
understood that the Sithe are not truly extinct. Rather, we’ve
completely sealed them away, making it impossible for them to return
once more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to listen attentively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
ago,” Autarch Titanos said, “The vast Chaosverse arose, giving
birth to countless living beings. Slowly, some embarked upon the path
of cultivation. Entropos was the first Autarch, and he was followed
by Awakener, then by myself. Next came Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch
Bolin, Autarch Stonerule, and Autarch Mogg.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Back
them, we lived without any worries or concerns. Entropos died trying
to take the final step, but that didn’t matter; everyone was
seeking their own paths, after all. But then… all of a sudden, and
without any warning, the Sithe emerged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe were both mysterious and powerful. The prime essences of the
Chaosverse sent us a warning, ensuring that we could subconsciously
sense that the Sithe posed an enormous threat to us,” Autarch
Titanos said. “Have you seen any Sithe Exalts yet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have.” Ning’s eyes lit up and he immediately said, “I saw the
Sithe Exalt imprisoned in the Earthfire Continent. If I’m not
mistaken… that Sithe Exalt had the insights of an Autarch.
Logically speaking, he should’ve been an Autarch… but his actual
power level was far lower. He was probably just on par with the
Domain Rulers outside this cottage.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos nodded. “Yes. They are Autarchs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned. “They really are Autarchs? B-but their power…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
aren’t Autarchs from this place,” Autarch Titanos said. “Although
our Chaosverse is almost infinitely vast… outside the Chaosverse
there is a truly infinite and endless region which has other living
creatures within it. The Sithe race stems from another Chaosverse
located within the Infinite Void!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
different Chaosverse?!” Ning had yet to even leave this Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
we became Autarchs, we were able to glean some secrets from the prime
essences of the Chaosverse,” Autarch Titanos said. “The vast and
endless void is filled with a number of enormous celestial bodies,
with the largest being the Chaosverses! But even in the Infinite
Void, Chaosverses are incredibly rare and few in number. The most
powerful and most invincible of all beings in the Infinite Void are
the Lords of Chaos, the controllers of the Chaosverses!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you wish to become a Lord of Chaos and master a Chaosverse, you must
first become an Autarch! Then, you must master and bind the entire
Quintessence of that Chaosverse, which would give you full control
over all the power that Chaosverse has.” Autarch Titanos looked at
Ning. “You should understand by now how much strength would be
needed to take full control over the power of the Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned. Of course he knew! The power hidden within the vast
Wellspring Seas of the Eight Domains was already vastly beyond the
power which Autarchs could command. The power of the entire
Chaosverse? That would be insanely, indescribably vast. Taking
control over all of it was completely inconceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe come from a different Chaosverse which already has a supremely
exalted Lord of Chaos controlling it! This was why their civilization
has reached such incredible heights, and why they have so many
marvelous techniques at their disposal,” Autarch Titanos said. “But
because their Chaosverse already has a person in control of it,
there’s no way for a second Chaoslord to arise… and so they have
invaded our Chaosverse and seek to dominate it instead!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
they are foreign invaders, while this is our home. Here, they will
suffer invisible pressure which ensures that they aren’t able to
gain any additional power from the Dao here. Even their Autarchs are
weakened by this invisible pressure. Without the power of the Dao
supporting them, they are naturally much weaker than they should be,”
Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are completely different races from us, because they were born in a
completely different Chaosverse… but once they are able to take
control over our Chaosverse, they can transform it and make it
suitable for them. As for those of us who were born here? All of us
will perish! From that day forth, all creatures born from our
Chaosverse shall be like them – Sithe.” Autarch Titanos looked at
Ning. “This is literally a war of survival. We cannot shirk our
duty.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
asked, “So the enemy Lord of Chaos is afraid to come here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
wouldn’t dare.” Autarch Titanos explained, “The wellspring of
his power is his Chaosverse! He’s able to make use of that power
anywhere in the Infinite Void, which is why he is invincible. But…
if he was to enter our Chaosverse, he would lose access to that power
and would be suppressed, just like everyone else. That’s why he
wouldn’t dare to enter himself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
besides… why would he? He already stands at the very peak of power
in all the Infinite Void, capable of accomplishing anything he
desires.” Autarch Titanos sighed. “Alas, the other creatures
within his Chaosverse wish to become Lords of Chaos as well. Their
only choice is to leave their Chaosverse and invade other ones… and
so, we ended up becoming a target for them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
already killed sixteen Sithe Exalts and trapped six of them. There
are probably other Exalts sealed away within the Sithelands as well.
In other words… tens of ‘Autarchs’ from their Chaosverse have
invaded ours. From this, you should be able to tell the difference in
power between them and us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. The difference was clear, obvious, and enormous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
surpass us in many ways, such as in fashioning treasures and
techniques,” Autarch Titanos said. “We were able to suppress them
during the war thanks to our geographical advantage and managed to
lock them away into their ‘homelands’, making it impossible for
them to invade us again… but in the end, they will always pose a
threat. Even worse, if enough time passes we might be invaded by
other civilizations as well!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus…
the only way to forever get rid of all these problems is to produce a
Lord of Chaos ourselves!” Autarch Titanos said. “If we can take
control over our own Chaosverse, then we’ll be able to make full
use of its power. When that happens we would have the power to invade
others, but no one would dare to invade us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed with this assessment. Their Chaosverse was without a ruler,
but they had still managed to fight back for so long. Once they did
gain a Chaoslord, then they would become truly invincible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alas,
taking control over the Chaosverse is simply too hard.” Autarch
Titanos shook his head. “Entropos gave it a try, but he died.
Awakener also tried, but he also died.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_012__The"></A>
Chapter 12: Help</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
power of the Chaosverse is too overwhelmingly mighty. Although we
were born from this Chaosverse and thus the prime essences do not
reject us, we still cannot withstand their incredible might.”
Autarch Titanos sighed. “Trying to accomplish this task through raw
force simply results in us imploding under the weight of the
Chaosverse’s power. It’s sheer suicide! Entropos and Awakener
were both extremely powerful, but neither of them were able to endure
the weight of that power. Before they died, they sent us messages to
never try it again; the difference was simply too great.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other four Autarchs all fell silent, while Ning himself nodded
slowly. It was like death through over-eating. Sometimes, accepting
an excessively heavy burden would result in you being crushed to
death by it! Even the most powerful figures in the Chaosverse, the
Autarchs, were unable to withstand even the minimum pressure required
to take control over the full power of the Chaosverse. This must have
been why the estate-spirit of the Azureflower Estate had stated that
Autarch Awakener had essentially commited suicide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we had no other choices available to us,” Autarch Titanos said.
“This is the only method we had available for ensuring the
perpetual security of our Chaosverse. There really are no other
options available to us. That’s why Skyfeeder was planning to make
the attempt as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
spent an incredibly long period of time training in the
Quintessence,” Autarch Skyfeeder said. “I’ve tried a few
low-level mock-bindings. I think I have a shot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Awakener
and Entropos both felt the same way.” Autarch Titanos shook his
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the allure of it all.” Autarch Ekong chuckled. “Stop playing the
fool. There’s ALWAYS a ‘shot’, but we’d probably all die
chasing after that flitting chance. Now that we have Darknorth, our
civilization has a real shot. There’s no need for us to foolishly
go off and commit suicide.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Puzzled,
Ning asked, “Are there really no other options? Is becoming a Lord
of Chaos truly the only path which is available to us? If we’ve
already defeated the Sithe and sealed them away, why don’t we just
kick them all out?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we could kick them out, we would’ve done so long ago.” Autarch
Bolin chuckled softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
not able to do that,” Autarch Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder smiled and explained, “Daolord Darknorth, as you know the
Sithe have incredibly powerful weapons at their disposal. The deeper
you go into their ‘homeland’, the stronger their defenses become
and the more powerful their weapons are! Their homeland is the most
dangerous place in all the Chaosverse. During the Dawn War, what we
did was to attack their bases throughout the Chaosverse. We didn’t
fight them in their lair!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
had a geographical advantage when fighting in the other parts of the
Chaosverse. The Sithe were confident in their chances at first, and
if they wished to bind the Quintessence they would have to kill us
all,” Autarch Skyfeeder explained. “That is why they came out of
their main base and fought against us throughout the Chaosverse. In
the end, we won an extremely narrow victory.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they wish to bind the Quintessence, they must kill you all first?”
Ning didn’t fully understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos nodded. “Correct.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Early
on, during the first days of the Chaosverse, there were actually
extremely few living beings. Later on, life began to flourish. More
and more living beings came into existence… but there’s a limit
to how much energy the Chaosverse has! Cultivators learned to take in
the power of the Chaosverse for themselves, becoming more powerful.
By now, I estimate that the majority of the power of the Chaosverse
has actually been concentrated within the bodies of the countless
cultivators currently alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus,
when cultivators die and their truesouls collapse, all that energy
shall return to the Quintessence or the local everworlds and
otherverses. However… the Sithe knew a way to kill us and then take
away our truesoul energy!” Autarch Titanos continued, “The more
of us they killed, the weaker our entire Chaosverse became. If it
loses enough power, the Quintessence itself will become so weak that
even foreign outsiders like the Sithe will be capable of binding it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally understood. As in all other areas, the Sithe undoubtedly had
binding techniques that far surpassed what the local cultivator
civilizations possessed! However, they were still outsiders; they
would be suppressed and rejected by this Chaosverse. They had to
first weaken it and bleed it before they would stand a chance at
success.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
most powerful creatures in our entire Chaosverse are the Autarchs.
Us. If they can kill even a single Autarch, it would be considered a
great success.” Autarch Titanos chuckled. “A pity for them that
killing us is extremely difficult. Below us are the Hegemons, and the
Sithe are quite happy to kill them as well. What they needed was
slaughter on a vast scale, and in order to achieve that they had to
come out from their main lair and attack us throughout the
Chaosverse. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to achieve
their aims.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, we won. However, during our final assault against the
Sithelands, we were only able to take control over their outer
perimeter. We could sense that tremendous danger lay hidden at the
center of their lair, and we could subconsciously sense that if we
dared to attack, we could very well perish. Thus, we decided to
instead seal them away and ensure that they cannot come out,”
Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
their goal was to weaken our Chaosverse, we naturally had to come up
with a way to replenish it and strengthen the Quintessence. We chose
to use the imprisoned Sithe Exalts for that task. The ‘torture’
those Sithe Exalts are enduring is actually serving to slowly
assimilate them in order to replenish the energies of the Chaosverse.
The goal is to cause them to break down, at which point we would
assimilate every scrap of their power. Since their power originally
came from outside our Chaosverse, this will allow the total amount of
energy belonging to our Chaosverse to grow,” Autarch Titanos
explained. “This was a clumsy method, but the only one we had.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong smirked. “Unfortunately, it hasn’t really worked at all.
Those six imprisoned Sithe Exalts have been resisting our efforts.
They’ve been tormented for ages, but their Dao-hearts have yet to
crumble and they remain in control of their energies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sooner
or later, they’ll give up. Once they do so, they’ll be
assimilated and their energies shall be taken away,” Autarch
Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Puzzled,
Ning said, “During the war, we killed many Sithe Exalts. Were we
unable to draw from the truesoul energies of those slain Exalts?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wouldn’t
work.” Autarch Ekong laughed, “Things aren’t going to be that
easy! Long ago, the Sithe set wards over their truesouls. As soon as
they die, their energies will depart from our Chaosverse and return
to their own. That’s why we had to imprison those six Sithe
Exalts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus…
our civilization is actually in dire straits,” Autarch Titanos
said. “All of us are doing our best to try and solve this problem,
because we fear that one day an outside power will take control over
our Chaosverse and terraform it to become more hospitable to them,
resulting in our complete extermination.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally understood. In the past, Ning was without any real worries or
concerns; he felt that if there were any existential problems, it
would be up to the Autarchs to handle them. There was no need for him
to concern himself. But now that he stood amongst the ranks of the
Autarchs, he finally understood just how dangerous a situation the
Chaosverse was in!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
much longer would the cultivator civilizations be able to last? A few
million more chaos cycles? A few billion? Longer? But if they were
unable to produce a true Lord of Chaos, then in the end they would
still face extinction. Even if they weren’t destroyed by the Sithe,
they would be destroyed by other outside civilizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Going
against the laws of the Chaosverse is actually causing harm to the
prime essences, which is why we rarely reverse spacetime to revive
people.” Autarch Titanos sighed. “Your deceased Dao-companion is
a good example. Her truesoul contained just the tiniest of smidgeons
of Autarch Awakener’s power; reversing spacetime to revive her
really wouldn’t cause any harm to the prime essences at all. And
yet, the prime essences would fight back with all their might to
resist it! This is because they innately wish to stay in peak
condition, for fear that outside forces will take control over them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
Thankfully, the situation isn’t critical just yet,” Autarch Ekong
said with a laugh. “Although there might be more enemies in the
future, for now we only have to face the Sithe! We’ve sealed away
their homeland, giving us the upper hand!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
celebrate just yet,” Autarch Titanos said calmly. “The Sithe have
been dormant for far too long. They might receive reinforcements from
outside and become even more powerful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we have Darknorth.” Autarch Ekong continued to smile happily. He
was the only Autarch who had risen to power after the Dawn War had
concluded. As a result, he was the most confident of the five.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Titanos laughed in a relaxed manner. “Five of the six
Autarchs have all gathered here today. Mogg is the only one absent,
and that is because he is permanently stationed to stand guard over
the Sithelands and keep an eye on it. This is because there is
something we need from you, something that involves the survival of
our entire civilization.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The other four Autarchs all looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Pray
tell.” Ning nodded. Now that he knew what a dangerous situation his
civilization was in, he naturally wouldn’t shirk his duty. As
someone who now stood at the very apex of power, he had to help the
Autarchs as best he could. As the saying goes, ‘when the skies
collapse, let the big guys handle it’; Ning was now one of the ‘big
guys’!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
when our civilization gives rise to a Lord of Chaos shall we be truly
and perpetually safe.” Autarch Titanos looked at Ning. “But
taking control over the full power of the Chaosverse is very, very
difficult. We stand no chance at all. There is, however, one path
that is certain to succeed. That path is… using an Omega Dao to
become an Autarch!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_013__The"></A>
Chapter 13: What Do You Desire?</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are on par with us in power. If you became an Autarch through an
Omega Dao, you would probably become far, far more powerful than the
rest of us, and far more powerful than Entropos and Awakener were.
Awakener, Entropos, Skyfeeder… all of them sensed that they had a
chance. An Omega Autarch would probably be able to easily annihilate
the entire Sithelands with ease! If you also had control over the
full power of the Chaosverse, you would become completely
invincible.” Autarch Titanos looked at Ning. “And that is what we
need your help for.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Me?
But… I’ve already failed my Daomerge,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
but you’ve mastered an Eternal Omega Dao,” Autarch Skyfeeder
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
your Eternal Omega Dao, I feel confident that our civilization will
soon give birth to a true Omega Emperor! There are no lethal pitfalls
between the ‘Emperor’ stage and the ‘Autarch’ stage, which
means that given enough time that person would have a chance. Even if
he remained at the ‘Emperor’ stage, he would still be on par with
the five of us in power.” Autarch Titanos said eagerly, “In the
past, we’ve actually worked to hide the existence of the Omega
Daos, preventing word of them from spreading. This was because this
path was so difficult, we were afraid that many of our most talented
geniuses would die when attempting to trod it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Consider
many of the current Hegemons. Imagine if they had known of the
existence of Omega Daos when they were at the World level, and even
had techniques to guide them! Given their talent and given enough
time, many of them would stand a good chance in embarking upon the
path of the Omega Dao… but what would the end result be? They would
fail the Daomerge, then die!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
chances at the Daomerge are much better if you train by yourself,
rather than receive fragmented guidance from others. Those who are
good enough to blaze a trail for themselves stand the best chances of
all,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed with this assessment. When you had no guidance, cultivation
would be extremely difficult… but as a result, those who
nonetheless succeeded were generally possessed of incredible
comprehension abilities! The Three Realms was a good example of this.
They originally had no legacies or techniques to guide them, making
it hard for them to even reach the World level… but those who
succeeded were all truly incredible figures!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was doubly true for the Omega Daos. If you were given guidance, you
might be able to embark upon a path you would never have been able to
discover on your own… but in the end you would still fail before
the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
who were able to embark upon this path on their own would naturally
be blessed with tremendous talent and insight! In all the Chaosverse,
only a pitiful handful of people were able to even reach the Fourth
Step of an Omega Dao. Every single such person was an incredible
genius, and they had a good chance at the Daomerge. Even though they
all failed, it merely represented a fairly small loss of life; it
wouldn’t have much of an impact on the Chaosverse as a whole. But
if cultivators began to train in the Omega Dao on a wide scale? Many
geniuses would perish on this path, resulting in the Chaosverse
having fewer experts and becoming weaker as a whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
now, things are different!” Autarch Titanos said. “Now that we
have an Eternal Omega Dao, we have a complete path which future
cultivators can follow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
means we can now truly publicize the existence of the Omega Daos,
allowing many cultivators to embark upon this path at the World
level. With your Daomerge experiences guiding the way, they won’t
make any unnecessary mistakes. Their chances at success will
instantly increase a hundredfold or more!” Autarch Titanos
explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sighed. If a senior had blazed a path for him and let him know what
was needed, he himself probably would’ve succeeded. Now that he had
become the trailblazer, future cultivators would have a clear
understanding of what they needed to do. With enough experience and
enough preparation, they would stand a far better chance than
cultivators did in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
need your help,” Autarch Titanos said solemnly. “We would like to
ask you to entrust your Eternal Omega Dao to us. We will then impart
it to the juniors who have become Daolords of the Fourth Step in an
Omega Dao… but of course, we’ll also ask them to swear lifeblood
oaths to enter your school and become known as the honorary disciples
of Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Bolin, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Stonerule, Autarch Ekong,
and Autarch Titanos all looked at Ning, hoping to hear his answer.
However… they also knew that cultivators guarded their supreme
techniques with extreme jealousy, treating them as their babies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had experienced so many setbacks and sorrows. He had experienced
countless dangers and seen many things before finally managing to
devise his [Eternal Omega Sword Dao], his most supreme technique. Any
major power would feel a tremendous sense of attachment to a supreme
technique like this! They had sacrificed far, far too much for the
sake of their Daos; it could be said that they had poured their
entire lives into their Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
is why there was a saying that ‘the Dao is not to be transmitted
lightly’. The five of them were asking for Ning to just give his
Dao to them in all of its entirety, allowing every single Fourth Step
Omega Daolord to train in it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…Very
well.” Ning nodded, and looks of delight instantly appeared on the
faces of the five Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivator civilizations will never forget you.” All of them were
tremendously excited. They were afraid that Ning would be stubborn
and selfish. If he refused to transmit his Dao to them, there would
be nothing they could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. “Autarch Awakener and the others have all sacrificed their
lives for this, and Autarch Mogg has sworn to eternally stand guard
over the Sithelands. I, Ji Ning, have nothing of value to offer; the
only thing I have is my Eternal Omega Dao. How can I complain about
offering it up? However, I do want to add in a rule; it is not to be
transmitted to those who are wicked of heart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no need to worry about that,” Autarch Titanos said hurriedly. “What
we’re trying to do is produce a Lord of Chaos who will be in charge
of our Chaosverse. How could we possibly dare to let an evil person
take that role? He could well become a calamity unto all of
civilization!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
only reason we even allow those evil cultivators to exist is to
ensure that the cultivator civilizations remain in a state of
constant combat, which helps to temper cultivators and allow for more
powerful cultivators to arise. If it wasn’t for that, I personally
would’ve wiped out many of the vilest cultivators long ago,”
Autarch Skyfeeder said coldly. By her very nature, she was someone
who felt extreme hatred for evildoers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
now that you’ve agreed, Darknorth, things will be simple.”
Autarch Titanos beamed merrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
immediately send word throughout the Chaosverse of the existence of
Omega Daos. We’ll even give copies of the various Fourth Step Omega
Dao techniques we already possess to the Hegemons of the various
realmverses and let them impart them to those they favor.” Autarch
Ekong smiled. “We have quite a few Fourth Step Omega Dao
techniques. Once one of them becomes a Daolord of the Fourth Step,
we’ll transmit your Eternal Omega Dao to them, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. I’ll immediately record a copy and also include all the many
experiences I had and insights I gained during the Daomerge process,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Bolin looked at Ning. “In doing this, you will have
contributed far more to this Chaosverse than any of us ever have.
Tell me, is there anything you need? We’ll do whatever we can to
help you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
what do you desire?” Autarch Titanos and the others all looked at
Ning. They knew that Ning had already failed his Daomerge and
wouldn’t have much time left to live. Most likely, he had certain
things he wished to ensure were taken care of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was briefly startled by this. “My greatest desire…” Ning’s
mind instantly became filled with images of his homeland, of his wife
Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
homeland was the place he cared the most about, a source of warmth…
while his wife, Yu Wei, was the person he would never be able to
forget about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
we aren’t able to reverse spacetime to revive your Dao-companion.”
Autarch Titanos let out a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled. “There is one thing that worries me… the safety of my
homeland! But I’ve already sent Nuwa to stand guard over it. If
something truly dangerous happens, I’ll have Nuwa ask you to help
out, Autarchs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
a miniscule request.” The five Autarchs all felt that this was very
simple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
IS one more thing, but it’ll be a bit trickier,” Ning said. “My
homeland is located within the Flamedragon Realmverse! Thus, I don’t
wish to see the Flamedragon Realmverse be destroyed. The Terror
Starsea is close to the Flamedragon Realmverse, and it has a
slowly-growing pair of Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels. I’m fairly strong,
but I can’t last too long in combat; if I tried to destroy the
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, I’d probably die in the attempt due to my
truesoul collapsing. Thus, I would like to ask you to help destroy
the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
handle this one,” Autarch Titanos said immediately. Although
destroying the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels would be rather taxing even
for the Autarchs, it still wasn’t an excessively major request.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
course, they normally wouldn’t intervene in this manner as they
would allow the Chaosverse to develop in its own natural manner!
There was no point in them exerting so much effort for something of
little benefit… but now that Ning had made the request, they
immediately accepted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Anything
else? These are all simple tasks.” Autarch Titanos smiled. “To be
honest, the five of us feel like we have wronged you and owe you a
tremendous debt. You have blazed a trail for us and brought hope to
our Chaosverse, after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
really can’t think of anything else for now,” Ning said with a
laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
greatest desire was to revive his wife. If he could somehow manage to
reach Autarchy with his Omega Dao before his truesoul disintegrated,
he’d probably be able to avoid dying… but that was nothing but a
foolish dream! The Autarchs weren’t capable of reviving his wife,
while Ning himself didn’t have enough time. There was no way he
could upgrade his Omega Dao to Autarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that you were searching for Nuwa,” Autarch Skyfeeder said
suddenly. “You’ve now arranged for her to safeguard your
homeland. The more powerful she is, the more effective she will be in
this task. Based on what I know, she hasn’t become an Otherverse
Lord yet, right? There are some unbound otherverses within the Eight
Domains. I’ll gift one to Nuwa and let her become an Otherverse
Lord.”</P>

Chapter 14: A Perfect Technique</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Autarch Skyfeeder.” Ji Ning revealed a delighted look. Finding
an ownerless otherverse was no easy task, but it was quite simple for
Autarchs because they were the creators of the otherverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
The calm and stoic Autarch Bolin said, “You failed the Daomerge,
resulting in your truesoul crumbling away. I have a treasure that can
help fortify and stabilize your truesoul, ensuring that the crumbling
speed is somewhat slowed down!” Autarch bolin waved his hand,
causing a palm-sized white disc to appear in front of him. This white
disc was covered with two golden runes that emanated mysterious
ripples of power which caused Ning’s truesoul to feel very
comfortable. Just as Ning was sighing in amazement, it flew into his
hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
this treasure, I should be able to live 30% longer than I originally
anticipated.” Ning didn’t decline, immediately accepting it into
his body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have one as well. It might not be as good as Bolin’s, but it should
still be of help to you,” Autarch Skyfeeder said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Me
too,” Autarch Titanos said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can give you one of these toys as well.” All five Autarchs took out
a variety items for Ning. Some were unique Sithe treasures, while
others were naturally formed curios that were born from the
primordial chaos. All of them were beneficial to the soul and the
truesoul. In truth, the Autarchs really didn’t care about treasures
like these, because they had truly infinite lifespans; why would they
even need these things? They only thought of them after Autarch Bolin
raised the subject.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t decline any of the offers. All of the treasures served to
firm up the soul and truesoul, but of course using multiple treasures
resulted in diminishing returns. All combined, these treasures would
slow down his truesoul’s disintegration by nearly half. He would
most likely be able to live roughly 60% longer than he had originally
anticipated! But of course, if he had to engage in fierce combat then
his truesoul’s disintegration would be hastened dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
our civilization is far weaker than the Sithe civilization,”
Autarch Titanos said with a sigh. “The Sithe have far more profound
techniques, and they don’t even differentiate between ‘divine
power’ or ‘Immortal energy’. They’ve perfectly merged
everything into one type of energy, and their Daolords don’t even
face any mortal danger during the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Their
World-level cultivators become Daolords, their Daolords become
Emperors, and their Emperors become Autarchs! None of them face any
mortal danger during each step of the process. This is a truly
perfect cultivation system they have,” Autarch Titanos said. “Our
civilization, however, only has access to cruder techniques. Daolords
tread the line between life and death with each step they take. The
first four steps aren’t so bad, but the Daomerge is the greatest
obstacle all of us face.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
danger at all?” Ning was shocked. He knew that the Sithe followed a
completely different path of cultivation that was akin to the
azureflower mist energy, which Autarch Awakener had created based on
his research into the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Correct,”
Autarch Skyfeeder agreed. “At the Daolord level, they can make
repeated mistakes but still try again. Even if they fail the
Daomerge, their truesoul will not disintegrate; they can try the
Daomerge a thousand times if they so choose. Their only limitation is
that there is a limit to their lifespan; if they cannot succeed
before their lifespan comes to an end, they will die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning immediately asked, “Have any of you received the Sithe
training techniques?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have. Many of them, in fact.” Autarch Titanos shook his head. “But
it is useless. They are completely different types of lifeforms who
were birthed from a completely different Chaosverse. There’s no way
for us to use their cultivation techniques at all! We tried to make
use of them long ago, and Awakener poured his heart into researching
them, but to no avail. This was his greatest regret when he died.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but ask, “Can you give me those Sithe techniques
and let me take a look?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Absolutely.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have plenty as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
a look, Darknorth.” The five Autarchs knew what Ning was thinking.
The Sithe cultivation techniques were truly perfect, ensuring that
there were no fatal obstacles at any stage of cultivation. In truth,
this wasn’t all that surprising. There were no fatal obstacles for
World level cultivators seeking to become Daolords, nor were there
any obstacles for Emperors seeking to become Autarchs. Why, then, was
it so difficult for Daolords to become Emperors? It was precisely
because of existing flaws with their cultivation techniques!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
five Autarchs immediately handed over storage-type treasures to Ning,
each of which was filled with many jade slips.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of these techniques are suitable for us cultivators to train in,”
Autarch Titanos said. “You would have to retrofit them in ordre to
make use of them. Some technical techniques are usable, but the
cultivation techniques are completely unusable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me take a look first.” After acquiring all these jade slips, Ning
waved his hand and caused oen to appear at random, which he
immediately began to read.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
jade slip was filled with the Sithe language. The Sithe script was
actually quite similar to the script used to write the words
‘Crimson’ ‘Wave’ ‘Temple’, and they also seemed similar
to the azureflower seal-script within the Azureflower Estate. This
was an extremely profound and abstruse language. The language alone
was a testament to how much more advanced the Sithe were compared to
local cultivators. This was why a mere Sithe incursion force had such
an enormous number of Exalts within it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thankfully,
the Autarchs and the local cultivators had the advantage of
geography. The invading Exalts were unable to manifest the power of
the Dao and were constantly suppressed by the prime essences of this
Chaosverse, ensuring that they were ‘merely’ at the power of the
Blazesun Ruler. This invasion force had paid an enormous price!
Invading another Chaosverse and taking control over its Quintessence
was an extremely, extremely difficult task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
truly is a perfect cultivation technique.” Ning couldn’t help but
sigh in awe when he read through the jade slip. There was literally
nothing to change or improve on. Every single part of the process,
from start to finish, was filled with boundless mysteries. It was
profounder than profound and represented true and utter perfection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sort of cultivation ensured that the energies produced by cultivation
were all one and the same, making it even more complete than the
azureflower mist energy Ning used. In the end, the azureflower mist
energy still had some flaws. Sithe cultivators, however, were able to
use their energies to both control magic treasures and refine their
bodies to make them comparable to the bodies of Ancient cultivators.
At the Daolord stage, no truesoul crumbling would occur whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
perfection.” After reading through the technique, Ning couldn’t
help but feel a sense of despair. He was completely incapable of
creating something like this; the difference between them was
incredibly vast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos and the other Autarchs had been alive for countless years,
but they couldn’t create anything like this either. All of them had
given up! Ning felt certain that this technique was probably created
by the Chaoslord of the Sithe Chaosverse, as in order to create a
technique like this you would first have to create an appropriate
language for it! Every single character of this language was filled
with the boundless mysteries of the Dao, and the language only
completely surpassed Ning’s abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
with that marvelous, arcane script could such an even more arcane
technique be created.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
our civilization gives birth to an Omega Autarch, we’ll have our
own Lord of Chaos and will also be able to produce such marvelous
techniques,” Autarch Titanos said. “We’ll skyrocket in many
different ways, and our weapons and treasures shall also rise to
become comparable with those of the Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Right now, they were behind in every single area; techniques,
weapons, warships, and more. Their only advantage lay in geography!
This was their home, and so every single stance they used was filled
with the tremendous power of the Dao. In contrast, their opponents
were being constantly suppressed and stifled by the prime essences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Darknorth, every single Autarch has a message-talisman that
allows us to communicate with each other across great distances. So
long as we are within the Chaosverse, we’ll be able to speak to
each other right away,” Autarch Titanos said as he produced a
dark-red jade talisman in his hand. “These talismans aren’t easy
to make. Previously, only Autarchs had access to them. You, however,
are special. You get one as well. If there’s anything you need,
just notify the six of us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
accepted the dark-red message-talisman. It was so red, it looked like
it had been bathed in blood. After binding it, Ning was able to
immediately sense the other six who were connected to it. He was able
to tell who each of the six was due to their unique auras, with the
most unfamiliar one most likely being the Autarch who was in charge
of safeguarding the Sithe lair, Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs spent quite some time chatting with Ning. They stood at the
very apex of the cultivator civilizations and thus concerned
themselves with affairs that involved the entire Chaosverse. Now that
Ning had reached the same level, he couldn’t help but sigh at how
little he could do. There was a limit to how much longer he would be
alive for, after all. In the end, it would be up to the Autarchs and
the future Omega Emperors to defend their realm… and the Omega
Autarch everyone was waiting for!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
Omega Autarch would catapult their civilization to brand new heights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
used the jade slip to leave behind a full and complete record of his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao, and also fully explained the experiences he
had during his Daomerge. For example, he wrote that one had to have
truly perfected one’s Dao-heart as a prerequisite. Even the
Autarchs couldn’t help but shake their heads when they heard this
requirement. This was incredibly difficult! Only when one’s
Dao-heart was perfect could one perfectly fuse heartforce, divine
power, and Immortal energy together. This truly was very, very
difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
having Ning’s experiences to serve as a guidepost was far better
than going in completely blind. If Ning had the benefit of something
like this, he would’ve succeeded in the Daomerge long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending half a day here, Ning prepared to bid them all farewell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
let me send you off,” Autarch Ekong said with a smile. “Didn’t
you say that once you left the Blazesun Domain, you would head back
to the Flamedragon Realmverse? That’s quite a distance away! I’ll
save you the trouble and send you myself; that will be much faster.
Once I reach the Flamedragon Realmverse, I’ll go ahead and deal
with that set of Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I’ll have to trouble you to help out, Autarch Ekong,” Ning said
appreciatively.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_015__The"></A>
Chapter 15: Autarch Ekong</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Creeeeak.
The wooden door swung open, with Ji Ning and Autarch Ekong walking
out side-by-side. Autarch Titanos, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Bolin,
and Autarch Stonerule remained inside the cottage, but they rose to
their feet to send the two off. As for the eight Domain Rulers, they
hurriedly and respectfully parted before the two.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The Flamewing God was being exceptionally obedient today. The five
Autarchs had given it a rare sense of enormous pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Done
already?” Flamewing blurted out. It was common for major powers to
spend a million years gathered together and chatting about the Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
long did you think it would take?” Ning smiled as he glanced at the
eight Domain Rulers. “Shall you come with us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
in no rush to leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
go right on ahead, Daolord.” It was quite rare that the eight
Domain Rulers had a good excuse to come visit one of the Autarchs;
how could they simply return like this? They naturally wanted to get
some tips or pointers out of Autarch Skyfeeder first.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
just notify us if there is anything you need at all,” Autarch
Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
there’s anything we can do, we’ll put all our effort into
carrying it out,” Autarch Stonerule agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, watched by four Autarchs and eight Domain Rulers, the two
departed. Autarch Ekong released a field of power which covered both
Ning and Flamewing, then began to advance through the sea of prime
essences at high speed. Whoosh! They almost instantly vanished off
into the horizon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
has been my first meeting with Daolord Darknorth, but it is also most
likely a final farewell,” Autarch Bolin sighed. Ning didn’t have
much time left. Given how strong he was, he probably wouldn’t need
to trouble them for anything he needed. It was naturally quite
unlikely that they would ever meet again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
we’ve only met him this once, he’s done something truly
incredible for all of civilization,” Autarch Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ensure
that his homeland is protected. That’s all we can do for him now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs felt many mixed emotions. In their eyes, Daolord Darknorth
was like a dazzling meteor who shone as radiantly as any Autarch, but
it was destined for him to fall. And yet… the light of this meteor
would illuminate a brand new path for all cultivators to walk! All
they could do was take care of Daolord Darknorth as best they could…
but at his level, there really were very few things he needed help
with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
Ning, seizing an otherverse from someone else would be incredibly
easy. At most it would cost him a bit of extra time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong continued to flare his around around Ning and Flamewing,
allowing them to travel through the sea of prime essences at
incredible speeds. In truth, Ning would’ve been able to do the
same, but his truesoul probably would’ve fully disintegrated from
the exertion before they had even made it out of the Quintessence.
Autarch Ekong didn’t have this concern and so was able to move at
maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
they left the Quintessence. After travelling a great distance, they
reappeared within the Blazesun Domain. Here, within an empty region
of space, there was a realmship with Nuwa, Su Youji, Patriarch
Treewind, Azurefiend, Hegemon Goodsong, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and a
number of others inside it. They were all relaxing and discussing the
Dao while waiting for Ning to return.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master’s
back!” Azurefiend, who was in control of the realmship, was the
first to notice the three figures who had appeared outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Those three figures instantly appeared inside of the realmship. When
Nuwa and the others saw the muscular, horned man dressed in green
robes who was by Ning’s side, they immediately fell silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled: “This is Autarch Ekong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarch of Annihilation?” Patriarch Treewind turned slightly pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Autarch Annihilation.” Patriarch Treewind and Imperator
Jade Rainbow were the first to speak out, quickly followed by the
others. Ning was able to refer to the man by his name, ‘Ekong’,
but most cultivators would respectfully address and refer to him as
‘Autarch Annihilation’. The Autarch of Annihilation was extremely
famous, especially since he had arisen after the Dawn War. All
learned figures like Patriarch Treewind knew of his name and title.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong said calmly, “No need to stand on ceremony. I’ll be coming
with you for a time, so you can all relax.” But of course, no one
present could possibly relax save for Ning himself. Even Flamewing
was shifting from side to side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Ekong, let’s go find that otherverse first,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well, let’s go.” Autarch Ekong sent out his will, generating a
massive wave of power that scooped up the realmship and then sent it
tearing through spacetime. Just a heartbeat later, they were out of
the Blazesun Domain and within a region of darkness. A second
spacetime warp, and they had arrived in an empty region within
another one of the Eight Domains, the Roaring Elepheant Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
moved so fast that Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, and the others were all
speechless. The many complicated spacetime obstacles within the Eight
Domains were nothing to the Autarchs!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that an otherverse? An ownerless otherverse?” Patriarch Treewind,
Hegemon Azurefiend, and the others all called out in surprise. They
were able to clearly see an enormous globe off in the distance that
looked as though it was merely a hundred billion kilometers in
diameter. This globe was covered with a layer of light that distorted
time, and it emanated ripples of unfathomable profundity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Otherverses
were incredibly vast inside and were comparable to a realmverse…
but from the outside, they weren’t necessarily all that large! When
the Autarchs first created them, they were merely palm-sized. If no
one was in control of them, they would grow to become a hundred
billion kilometers in diameter, and their aura would be clearly
visible for any to see. But once someone bound an otherverse, things
would be completely different.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
should be celebrating the fact that we discovered this otherverse.
Why do we have to fight to the death? If this battle continues, both
of you would probably die before winning this thing. How about this?
Why don’t you let me take control over this otherverse. I promise
I’ll give you the next one! I’m also willing to give you almost
all of my treasures. Why must you be so stubborn?” Five figures
were engaged in a furious battle off in the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are completely shameless! Give me the next one? Who knows when that
will be! We’ve all been cultivating for countless ages before
encountering something like this! How can I possibly just let you
take it? Either give me the otherverse or give me a comparable amount
of treasures. Compared to the otherverse, the treasures you offered
are a joke!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was quite a furious battle, but the two sides were fairly evenly
matched. In a situation like this, it would be difficult for either
side to truly defeat or kill the other. This was why neither side was
willing to give up. Generally speaking, the battle would only come to
an end once one side had completely depleted their reserves of divine
power and Immortal energy. In fact, for Hegemons to end up perishing
was quite ordinary as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,
make them stop,” Ning said with a laugh. It would be rather
excessive to ask Autarch Ekong to handle this, while the other
experts probably wouldn’t be frightening enough to bring an
immediate halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master.” Flamewing immediately assented to the order, then turned
towards the battling experts. “HEY! YOU FIVE! STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!”
A thunderous roar swept through spacetime as a giant winged bear who
was bathed in flames suddenly appeared. Flamewing glowered down
towards the five with unbridled arrogance, causing all of them to
instantly turn pale with terror. “A Chaos Primordial?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
a Chaos Primordial wanted to kill a Hegemon, it would be simplicity
itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Moments later, an entire host of cultivators came flying out of the
realmship, with Ning and Autarch Ekong in the lead. Behind them were
Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, Hegemon Goodsong,
and the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-what…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Isn’t
that Patriarch Treewind?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Eight Domains were all located quite close to the Quintessence of the
Chaosverse, and so these five Hegemons instantly recognized the
incredibly famous Patriarch Treewind and equally famous Imperator
Jade Rainbow. Both of them were Otherverse Lords! As for Hegemon
Goodsong, they were able to immediately see that he was a Golden
Emperor, which meant he also had the combat power of an Otherverse
Lord. Any of the three would be able to slay them with ease, as could
Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
scary thing was, none of these four were the leaders of this group.
The two leaders… one was a white-robed youth with a black sheath on
his back whose truesoul was disintegrating. A Daolord who had failed
the Daomerge, then? The other was a horned, muscular, green-robed man
whose aura, even when restrained, was enough to cause them to quiver
in their boots. They had never felt terror like this before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Autarch!” Although they had never met an Autarch before, they
instantly understood that it had to be an Autarch. Only an Autarch
could bring them such a sense of utter terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord who failed the Daomerge but can stand alongside an Autarch…
that has to be the legendary Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
five Hegemons stood there, shaking with terror. They no longer even
thought about fighting over the otherverse! They were stunned by this
utterly terrifying squad that had appeared before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but secretly sigh. Each Autarch had a different way
of dealing with things. Autarch Titanos would generally completely
hide his aura, while Autarch Ekong clearly was more dominating and
imperious in his actions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bah,
Skyfeeder… the ownerless otherverse she picked out for us had
actually been discovered by other cultivators already.” Autarch
Ekong frowned and shook his head. Given his pride, he really didn’t
want to earn a reputation for taking otherverses away from Hegemons.
He immediately said, “Darknorth, have your friend go and bind that
otherverse, I suppose.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead, Nuwa,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Nuwa didn’t hesitate, immediately flying towards that otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
for the five of you.” Autarch Ekong frowned. “This otherverse was
never meant for you, so you can forget about it. However… since you
managed to discover it, we are bound together by karma. I’ll give
each of you some good fortune. You can go now.” He waved his hand,
causing a surge of power to grab all five Hegemons and send them
through a spacetime tunnel that led to a treasure cache which Autarch
Ekong knew of.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_016__The"></A>
Chapter 16: Return</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
light shimmering over the surface of the otherverse rippled with
unfathomable, secretive mysteries.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
entered it all by herself. Just a heartbeat later, the otherverse
began to change and transform. The aura emanating from it began to
retract, while the ripples were completely restrained as well… and
at the same time, a flicker of green vitality appeared on its
surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
otherverse seems to have life in it,” Su Youji said with surprise
as she stared at the otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is indeed filled with life,” Autarch Ekong said calmly. “Ownerless
otherverses will operate in accordance with their intrinsic nature,
but they won’t have a will of their own! Now that Nuwa has bound
this one, Nuwa’s will shall become the will of this entire
otherverse, and her life force shall become one with the otherverse.
This otherverse shall become one of her incarnations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, the otherverse began to shrink in size before vanishing almost
completely. Nuwa reappeared once more as the tiny little dot flew
straight into her body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Disciple,
where do you plan to station your otherverse?” Patriarch Treewind
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Close
to home,” Nuwa said. “That way, the people of my homeland will
also be able to enter the otherverse and live there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
approved of this plan. Once an otherverse was affixed somewhere, it
would become a foundation of power. Otherverses also had many uses;
for example, one could use the power of an otherverse to warp through
spacetime at the speed of a realmship. It could even be linked to the
outside world via a stable spacetime tunnel! However, the longer the
tunnel was the more difficult its creation would be. Nuwa was
definitely going to establish a stable, permanent spacetime tunnel
between her otherverse and the Three Realms, and so she had to keep
it fairly close to the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Based
on what Ning now knew, it seemed obvious that the Otherverse Lord of
the ‘alternate universe’ which Ning had once visited, ‘the lord
of the Church of Annihilation’, had to have a connection to Hegemon
Brightshore! Otherverse Lords were in absolute control over their
otherverses, as the otherverses served like their incarnations. There
was no way that Hegemon Brightshore would’ve been able to
‘secretly’ establish a spacetime tunnel to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why Hegemon Brightshore had claimed otherwise was because he
wanted Ning, Skyfire, and the others to feel as though they were in a
dangerous place. He wanted to ensure that they would be on their
guard at all times; only then would this adventure serve its true
purpose. Ning suspected that if the ‘protectors’ had died,
nothing would happen… but if Skyfire Brightshore had been at the
verge of dying, Hegemon Brightshore or the lord of the Church of
Annihilation would’ve intervened to save him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words, that seemingly dangerous adventure had actually been
just a tempering experience for Skyfire Brightshore. There had been
no real danger at all, and Ning’s group had merely served as his
companions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
had been no real danger… but of course, Hegemon Brightshore
couldn’t let Skyfire know that! This was yet another testament to
how much effort Hegemon Brightshore put into his race. He truly did
pour his blood, sweat, and tears into making it prosper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go. We’re heading back to the Flamedragon Realmverse,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong, Ning, and the others all boarded the realmship and tore
through spacetime, once more warping towards the Flamedragon
Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Halfway
there, Hegemon Goodsong, Patriarch Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow,
and most of the others all departed. There was no way Ning would keep
them around at all times, after all. Nuwa bade her own master
farewell for now. She was going to go back home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
continued to advance through spacetime, moving far more quickly than
when they had left the Flamedragon Realmverse. The realmship tore
through spacetime at frightening speeds, causing spacetime to twist
into a dazzling rainbow tunnel around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Ekong and Ning were seated facing each other, sipping some
wine and chatting casually. Su Youji, Azurefiend, and the others
naturally didn’t dare to disturb them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
are your plans for after I deal with the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels?”
Autarch Ekong asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
CAN I plan? Haha. While I’m still alive, I’m going to wander
around the Chaosverse for a while,” Ning said. “But of course,
I’ll also analyze those Sithe techniques. Who knows, maybe I’ll
be able to create a complete technique that will allow me to somehow
survive. If that happens, I’ll stand a good chance of becoming an
Omega Autarch. Wouldn’t that be just perfect? Haha. I’m afraid to
even imagine how wonderful that would be.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
knows? It might just work.” Autarch Ekong laughed as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, both of them knew that this was far too difficult. Even
Autarchs would feel despair when they saw the marvelous, perfect
techniques the Sithe used. Ning felt the same. He himself had the
feeling that if he truly did devote all of his attention to analyzing
those techniques, he might have a chance at surviving… but the
amount of time needed would be measured in the hundreds of millions
of chaos cycles, if not longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short amount of time left to him wasn’t even close to being enough
for him to accomplish this. Not even Autarchs could accomplish this!
Autarch Awakener had been the most stubborn and had poured the most
effort into it, but in the end he had still failed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was joking just now. However… even though I’m going to die, I’m
still going to advance along the path of the Dao,” Ning said.
“Ekong, the five of you have already given me your techniques,
along with the techniques of Autarch Entropos and Autarch Mogg. I’m
going to wander the universe and learn as much as I can. I’ll make
as many breakthroughs as I can. Even if I am to die, I shall die on
the path I have chosen.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had recorded his Eternal Omega Dao technique, the various
Autarchs had handed over all of their own Daos to Ning as well,
hoping that they might inspire him somehow. But of course, Ning
wasn’t to transmit them to any others; he was the only one
permitted to examine them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Blazesun Domain, Ning had mastered the mysteries of water and
then created the Water Sword Dao, which had benefited him quite a
bit. Ning was planning to continue along this path and upgrade his
other Daos to the Hegemon level, then slowly infuse them all into his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao. This was a path towards Autarchy that would
require an extremely long period of time. Ning didn’t have enough
time, but he would still continue along this path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
to be honest, I’m just bored. If I don’t cultivate, what WOULD I
do?” Ning smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that’s more like it! When you have as much time to burn as we do,
meditating on the Dao is a great idea. Come, let’s drink!”
Autarch Ekong lifted his wine cup in a toast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse. The Terror Starsea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
group of cultivators were gathered here. Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon
Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, Daoist Bluestone, Emperor Goldisle,
Emperor Anchen, Emperor Islehide, Emperor Severfive… all of them
were present. Ning’s Primaltwin was located in the Flamedragon
Realmverse, and so he had notified the Emperors and Hegemons early
on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
they heard that an Autarch was going to intervene and destroy the
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, they became incredibly excited. They quickly
spread the word far and wide, allowing all of the six major powers
within the Flamedragon Realmverse to know what was about to happen!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
was incredibly excited by this news, because the destruction of the
Flamedragon Realmverse would result in them being forced to wander
the Chaosverse as refugees. Almost all creatures within the
realmverse would perish, with only a tiny fraction of creatures who
were protected by the major powers and drawn into their
estate-treasures being able to survive. Even if they made it to other
realmverses, they would be viewed with disdain by the original
inhabitants of those realmverses. This was exactly how the Dark
Kingdom had been treated by the rest of the Flamedragon Realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were also some races who actually lived in the Terror Starsea itself!
Thus, everyone hoped for the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels to be destroyed.
They all hoped that their homeland would be preserved. To wander as
refugees and then be rejected as outsiders was not a good life to
live!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A spacetime tunnel appeared out of nowhere, followed by a realmship
flying out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
Daolord Darknorth’s realmship.” Hegemon Brightshore and the
leaders of the six powers all stared over excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
group of people flew out of the realmship, led by Ning and a
muscular, horned man. Behind them were Su Youji, Protector Whitethaw,
Flamewing, and Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is Autarch Ekong,” Ning introduced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Autarch Annihilation.” Hegemon Brightshore led the
various cultivators in a deep, respectful bow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong nodded. “I’ve been asked to come here by Daolord Darknorth.
No need to stand on ceremony. I’ll go and destroy the Yin-Yang
Samsara Wheels right now.” As he spoke, he glanced at Ning and
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sorry
for the trouble,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
a minor matter… but the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels are rather
troublesome to deal with. It’ll take me a bit of time.” Autarch
Ekong flew off into the distance, moving through the void towards the
distant Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
really was an Autarch!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Autarch really has come to destroy the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flamedragon Realmverse has been saved!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
won’t have to evacuate after all.” Everyone present felt
tremendously excited. Even Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Netherlily,
and Hegemon Windrain were besides themselves with joy. As for the
Aeonians… Emperor Islehide and Emperor Anchen felt rather awkward
when facing Ning. Although there were a few grudges between them, the
difference in power was now so vast that they had long ago admitted
defeat. As for Ning, given that Autarch Bolin had been the creator of
the Aeonians, he wasn’t going to quibble over ancient matters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
this matter is resolved, we can all relax.” Ning smiled as well.
After this was finished, he would be at ease as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Youji,
watch closely. Events like this are quite rare,” Ning said with a
sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels consisted of two enormous symbiotic
vortexes that were so vast, each of them was comparable to a hundred
Badlands Territories in size!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
enormous green vortex was like a vast and verdant world, bathing the
area around it with green light that looked like the surface of the
sea. As for the black vortex, it formed a world of light around it as
well. As the two vortexes slowly drew closer to each other, all the
laws of spacetime began to twist and break apart. It had already
reached an inconceivable level of power, allowing it to shatter apart
the natural laws governing the universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
fact… it was extremely close to Autarchs in power! However, it was
just a celestial body. It wasn’t alive, and so it could only
passively ‘stand’ there and be beaten down. This was why Autarchs
could destroy them, if the Autarch was willing to pay the necessary
price.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong transformed into a giant, but compared to the Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels he was still a tiny little figure. He devoured an enormous
amount of energy from the surrounding area, then produced a greataxe
in his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
first delivered a furious blow with the greataxe towards the green
vortex. BOOM! The power of this blow was so tremendous that even the
distant Ning sighed in amazement. This truly was an impressive
display of power.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_017__The"></A>
Chapter 17: Back to the Three Realms</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong furiously slammed his greataxe down again and again, each
strike filled with dominating power. BOOM! The Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels seemed to sense that they were in danger, and they began to
instinctively react and defend themselves. The green vortex and the
black vortex simultaneously began to expand in size, almost instantly
expanding to become many times greater than they were previously. A
moment later, they instantly shrank to become less than half of their
original size.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sudden expansion and contraction resulted in the power of both
vortexes skyrocketing. Ji Ning and the others were watching from very
far away, but even so Hegemon Brightshore and the others felt their
hearts tremble with fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
while later, Ning’s eyes lit up: “It’s almost done.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Autarch Ekong roared furiously as he smote down his greataxe. The axe
actually transformed into an enormous black shadow that was as large
as the green vortex itself!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
green vortex let out a strange, almost ‘groaning’ sound as the
greataxe caved its center in, but it quickly managed to repair
itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break! BREAK!” Autarch Ekong attacked with extraordinary ferocity,
each strike filled with the power of annihilation. After the Autarch
let out twelve furious shouts, the green vortex was beginning to
tremble violently. The nearby black vortex was doing its best to
devour and tear apart all of the energies around it, but it was
unable to shake the Autarch at all. In the end, it could only ‘watch’
helplessly as its companion was annihilated!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The green vortex finally disintegrated, resulting in an awesome wave
of boundless life energy spreading out in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black vortex could not survive on its own. It instantly began to
collapse in on itself, with the process causing a tremendous amount
of destruction to its surroundings. Even Autarch Ekong had to
generate an aura of flowing black light to protect himself against
the final, suicidal burst of the black vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels were destroyed. The only things left were
a few ripples of power where they had existed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels have finally been destroyed. The Flamedragon
Realmverse is saved!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is absolutely wonderful!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flamedragon Realmverse shall be able to last for countless more
aeons. We won’t have to evacuate!” The Hegemons and Emperors of
the six powers of the Flamedragon Realmverse had all been watching
nervously. Now, they shook with excitement and their faces were
covered with joy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore turned to look at Ning, who was standing next to him. He
never would’ve imagined that the gravest peril the Flamedragon
Realmverse faced, the unstoppable apocalypse of the Samsara Wheels,
would eventually be resolved thanks to the then-World God he had
abducted all those years ago. It all seemed like a marvel, a miracle.
That World-level kid had skyrocketed in power at an inconceivable
speed, reaching a level where everyone looked up to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Darknorth,” Hegemon Brightshore said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you want to thank anyone, go thank Autarch Ekong.” Ning looked at
Autarch Ekong, who was flying back with a rather tired look on his
face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
downplay your role. The entire Flamedragon Realmverse owes you a debt
of gratitude. If it wasn’t for you, almost all of the weaker beings
in the entire realmverse would’ve died once the apocalypse came!
Very, very few would’ve been evacuated and given the dubious honor
of wandering homeless through the cosmos. In fact, most of the
evacuees probably would’ve died during the wandering… and the few
who survived would be hated as outsiders once they reached their new
home.” Hegemon Brightshore sighed. “It’s hard for me to even
imagine it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
own homeland is located in the Flamedragon Realmverse. I was acting
on my own behalf as well,” Ning said. He could sense the tremendous
gratitude the leaders of the six powers of the Flamedragon Realmverse
felt towards him. Even the Aeonians who had once held a grudge
against him such as Emperor Anchen and Emperor Islehide were staring
towards him with gratitude. Now that the realmverse was not going to
be destroyed, the Aeonians would be able to continually benefit from
the estate-world which Autarch Bolin had left behind for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Autarch Ekong came flying over, looking rather exhausted. “These
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels really were a pain to deal with. If they had
been allowed to grow for another million chaos cycles, even I
would’ve been gravely injured in the process of destroying them,”
Autarch Ekong said with a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. The Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels were similar to the Wellspring
Sea of the enormous Blazesun Domain. They were all bodies of natural
energy that actually surpassed the Autarchs in terms of raw power.
However, because they lacked true sentience, it wasn’t too hard to
deal with them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
now that I’ve dealt with the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, I’ll be
off,” Autarch Ekong said. “If there’s anything you need, just
give me a call.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
to my estate and have some wine first?” Ning felt as though he was
being a bad host to let the Autarch leave right away; the man had
come all this way to help him out, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
no need. Honestly, I have much more and much better wine than you.”
Autarch Ekong bade Ning farewell, then stepped through spacetime and
departed from the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only person he spoke to this entire time was Ning. He didn’t say so
much as a single word to the others. He was by nature a solitary and
arrogant person. Those he respected, he’d view as friends and
brothers; those he didn’t, he wouldn’t so much as glance at.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Word
of the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels’ destruction quickly spread across
almost all of the supreme figures of the Flamedragon Realmverse.
Everyone felt incredibly excited; finally, the looming, creeping
apocalypse that had been a threat to all of them had been dealt with!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he led Su Youji, Azurefiend, and Nuwa back to the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mother
Nuwa!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mother!”
The entire Three Realms was thrown into a state of excitement. By
now, the ‘Three Realms’ actually consisted of an enormous field
of space that held a total of 8100 chaosworlds within it! Ning’s
Primaltwin was here, and so he had already spread the word that
Mother Nuwa was coming back. Subhuti, Maitreya, Kuafu, and the other
major powers who had arisen during the first age were all
incomparably excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
Mother Nuwa was coming home!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Subhuti,
Windfiend, Kuafu, Jade Cauldron, Lu Dongbin, and tens of thousands of
other cultivators were all waiting in the emptiness of space in front
of the Three Realms Region, staring off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
a dimensional ripple appeared, followed by a realmship appearing
within it. Several figures flew out of the realmship, led by a
white-robed Ning and a silver-robed Mother Nuwa who bore a blood
diamond in the center of her forehead. After binding the otherverse
she had been given, Mother Nuwa’s aura had become even vaster than
ever before, as it whispered of the limitless power of the otherverse
itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa.”
Subhuti was so excited that his eyes were starting to fill up with
unshed tears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa.”
Windfiend revealed a smile. She had been an old enemy of his, but he
had never been able to best her. She had been the undisputed leader
of the Nuwa Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mother
Nuwa.” Kuafu and the others were all incredibly excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Subhuti,
Kuafu, Jade Cauldron, Maitreya…” When Nuwa saw all of these old
friends, she felt emotions surging through her breast. Many of her
oldest friends were already gone, such as Daoist Three Purities, Lord
Tathagata the Buddha, or the Three Sovereigns of Mankind. The
dazzling Houyi had also perished, as had many of the younger
cultivators she had held high hopes for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
a few of her old friends were still alive, as were some of the
‘children’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa.”
Sun Wukong was incredibly excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silly
monkey.” Nuwa smiled happily. When she saw some of these familiar
young faces, she couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. This was her
home! This was the place where she had been born from the primordial
chaos, and these were the friends she had slowly grown to know. She
had been born out of chaos, and so these friends were like her family
members.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
she had left the Three Realms, she had wished to see the wider world
outside before coming back and using what she had learned to
strengthen the Three Realms, making it better than ever. Alas,
destiny makes fools of mortals and Gods alike; she was actually
teleported to the indescribably distant Blazefire Domain and had only
survived thanks to Patriarch Treewind saving her. Now, thanks to Ning
locating her, she had finally come back home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mother
Nuwa’s return was an event of great joy. They naturally held an
enormous celebratory banquet for her. The many Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Three Realms all came to take part. Not only did
even the World-level cultivators come, even many of their Elder God
and Ancestral Immortal disciples were permitted to take part.
Millions of Immortals and Fiendgods took part in this grand banquet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seated
at the highest positions within this banquet were Mother Nuwa,
Subhuti, Ji Ning, Windfiend, Kuafu, and the other ancient figures. By
now, Ji Brightmoon, Ji Yichuan, and Yuchi Snow had all reached the
World level, and they were all seated quite high up. They were very
happy to be able to see the legendary Mother Nuwa herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a congregation of countless Immortals and Fiendgods, and Immortal
wine flowed liberally. Ning was very happy, and he naturally wouldn’t
be stingy with his resources. He naturally had far more treasures
than anyone else by now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms are truly flourishing.” Ning felt a sense of joy when
he saw all the cultivators present, and he couldn’t help but sigh
in praise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Three Realms were flourishing far more than in previous years. Now
that an Otherverse Lord like Mother Nuwa was standing guard over it
with the assistance of many powerful Sithe treasures, the Three
Realms truly had reached an incredibly high level of power. Given
even the Autarchs had promised to help watch over it, Ning finally
felt completely satisfied with its chances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is flourishing. Only… a few of our old friends are missing,”
Subhuti said from next to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Yes, a few people are missing.” Many of the true,
original leaders of the Three Realms were missing, as were some of
his friends and his wife.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they could all come back and be reunited, how wonderful would that
be?” Ning closed his eyes, just imagining the scene.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_018__The"></A>
Chapter 18: A Wandering Life</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
the banquet came to an end, Ji Ning led Nuwa and Subhuti out to begin
assembling the formation! Ning’s Primaltwin had already assembled
roughly 90% of the formation, and it only really needed the powerful
castle to merge together with the formation and become its core and
command center. This would allow the power of the formation to
skyrocket.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
one save for the Autarchs would stand a chance at breaking apart a
formation like this. Even the most powerful Sourcewalkers like the
Blazesun Ruler would probably find it very difficult to breach this
formation. It could be described as truly impregnable!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack
clack clack… the castle slowly slid into position, moving to become
the very center of the entire Three Realms Region. The leaves at its
bottom layer began to manifest green ley-lines that looked like the
veins of a tree leaf. These green ley-lines reached out of the leaves
themselves, stretching out into empty space and then completely
disappearing. They had completely linked up to the rest of the grand
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
maintained control over the fort while Ning made the necessary
adjustments. After three days, they finally completed the great
project.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The entire castle itself vanished into thin air, as did the
formations surrounding the Three Realms. They had all turned
invisible, but their power had just skyrocketed to a brand new level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
arrange for a golem to stand here and keep watch, ensuring that
nothing within the range of the formation’s scanners can avoid
detection,” Nuwa said. “If it finds anything, I’ll instantly
enter the castle and take control over it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
revealed a smile. The nearby Subhuti couldn’t help but turn to
glance at Ning. He knew just how much this disciple of his had done
for the Three Realms. Ning wanted to do everything he could before he
passed away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Master,” Ning suddenly said, “I’m planning to spend some
time with Brightmoon and my parents. I’m going to wander about the
Chaosverse with them, seeing the many marvels of the cosmos and
allowing them to better understand the Dao. Master, Windfiend, would
you like to join me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wonderful!”
Subhuti revealed a delighted look, then asked, “But wouldn’t we
be disturbing your family trip?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
it’s fine. My retainers will be taking part as well. It’ll make
this trip more fun,” Ning said with a laugh. He was planning to
spend his remaining years cultivating, but just staying in seclusion
and training in isolation was pointless. He didn’t have much time
left; he was going to spend at least some of it visiting the
marvelous sights of the Chaosverse. Many of those places might be
‘dangerous’, but there were no dangers that concerned him in the
slightest!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Chaosverse, any naturally-occurring dangers were no longer any
threat to him at all; he was on the same level of power as the
Autarchs, after all! Even the Eight Domains and the prime essence sea
were nothing to him. The only place that Ning felt any true dread of
was the Sithelands. There were numerous locations even in the outer
perimeter of the Sithelands, which had already been breached by the
Autarchs, which were capable of posing a threat to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because even the Autarchs had to put tremendous effort into
breaching the outer perimeter. There were a number of places the
Autarchs didn’t actually go inside and had instead simply sealed
off. Thus, there were many cultivators who would go exploring the
outer reaches of the Sithelands! That was a truly dangerous place,
and it was filled with all sorts of Sithe relics, treasures, and
traps. Ning didn’t feel that it was a suitable choice for his
parents and his daughter to visit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He’d
go take a look when his life was nearing its end. For now, he was
going to engage in cultivation instead. He had to infuse all the
other Daos into his Eternal Omega Sword Dao, and he was also going to
view many of the natural wonders of the Chaosverse! This would
actually be helpful for him in comprehending the Dao. Besides, this
was a good chance for him to show his daughter and his parents some
truly dangerous places. There were some places where not even
Otherverse Lords would dare tread, but for him it wouldn’t be a
problem.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
Brightmoon will be able to make a breakthrough as a result,” Ning
mused. There was no chance his parents would improve any further on
the path of cultivation, as they had to rely on pills just to reach
the World level. Brightmoon had spent 5 years and 2 months in Yu
Wei’s belly before being born, and she was born with such
incredible talent that she reached the Celestial Immortal level with
ease. Although her path to the World level had been rather bumpy,
Ning had patiently and attentively instructed her, ensuring that she
was able to succeed without needing to use any pills. Ning had
certain expectations of his daughter; he wasn’t going to just let
her take the easy way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
final decision was to bring his family members, his retainers, and
the duo of Subhuti and Windfiend! Windfiend was rather hesitant about
this, as his relationship with Ning couldn’t quite compare to that
of Subhuti’s. However, he was now a member of the Three Realms. The
future of the Three Realms would be up to Nuwa, Subhuti, and
Windfiend. Ning wanted to help his master and Windfiend as best he
could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we’ve finally left the Flamedragon Realmverse!” Brightmoon was
quite excited as she stared from within the realmship. Everyone in
this realmship was like an elder family member, and so she was able
to act in a much more relaxed manner. “I’ve never left the
Flamedragon Realmverse before. I hear that realmverses are all
extremely far from each other.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Calm
down. We’re going to visit some of the nearby realmverses first,
then we’ll head off to an extremely distant and dangerous place
known as the ‘Flamesea Thunderfalls’. That place is highly
suitable for training in the Dao of Lightning and the Dao of Fire.”
Ning looked at his daughter. “Brightmoon, your greatest affinity is
with the Dao of Fire. You’ll be able to meditate and gain keen
insights there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father,
didn’t you say that the Flamesea Thunderfalls is a place that can
easily kill Emperors, and where even Hegemons would suffer heavy
injuries?” Brightmoon asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
It is considered one of the thirty most dangerous locations of the
entire Chaosverse,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Hegemon Azurefiend chuckled, “Little lady, with Master
present you have nothing to fear. The Flamesea Thunderfalls is
nothing to Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
protect you too, Brightmoon!” the pudgy Flamewing said, pounding
his chest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Windfiend,
Subhuti, Yichuan, and Snow all stared curiously towards the sights
outside. None of them had left the Flamedragon Realmverse before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. Ning’s group spent quite a bit of time
wandering all of the realmverses in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance;
in total, they spent over thirty million years here. Ning happily
accompanied his family in their wanderings, not worried in the
slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
they left the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance and began to wander
through the cosmos. They visited many unique locales where the local
cultivators were often brutish, powerful, and eccentric. Generally
speaking, they weren’t very welcoming of outsiders! But when they
saw Ning, they all went on their absolute best behavior.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because Ning, to avoid unnecessary trouble, sent Flamewing ahead
of them and ensured that the locals would all be sufficiently cowed
by the time the realmship arrived. As soon as the locals saw
Flamewing, they quickly understood that their visitor was Daolord
Darknorth. Who would dare to be disrespectful to him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
planet is so beautiful. I’ve never seen a world as beautiful as
this one.” Brightmoon loved this place. This was a unique world
known as the Immortal Ravine, and Ning’s group ended up spending a
million years living here because it truly was quite beautiful. Its
lovely but alien environment was completely a product of nature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father,
buy this! And that! I want this one also!” Each time Ning reached a
new place, he would ask the local powers to bring over some unique
treasures which might be of use to his daughter or his parents. Once
they found something of interest, Ning would pay a very high price to
acquire the items. Thus, the major powers were quite eager to bring
out all of the strange and odd treasures they had stored away. They
all hoped for Daolord Darknorth to take a fancy to their treasures,
as they knew that Daolord Darknorth wouldn’t be stingy in payment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Brightmoon,
Snow, Yichuan, Subhuti, and Windfiend all had their horizons expanded
considerably. Even Su Youji saw much more than she had in the past.
Although she had accompanied Ning to the Blazesun Domain, they hadn’t
made any detours and so she hadn’t really seen much. This time,
they were on what amounted to a leisurely excursion!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
toured through one place after another, and when they found some
unique treasures or saw some unique sights, Ning would seize the
opportunity to guide his daughter and help her in her cultivation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, Ning devoted the majority of his time to his own
cultivation. His Primaltwin remained within the Azureflower Estate.
Not only had he acquired a large number of Sithe cultivation
techniques from the Autarchs, he had even acquired the Daos they used
to reach Autarchy! Ning naturally wanted to spend his time analyzing
them and perhaps find a way for himself to survive. Although the
chances were quite low, he still had to give it a shot. Ning wasn’t
the type to just sit there and wait for death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Heart of Eternity.” Within the Azureflower Estate. The black-robed
Ning waved his hand, causing the Heart of Eternity to appear and
float in the air before him. It remained covered by layers of
inscrutable runes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been quite some time since I’ve tried to solve it. I should give it
another shot.” Ning had reached a much higher level of
comprehension, now that he had mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao.
“I’m far more powerful than I was before I attempted the
Daomerge. I should be able to solve more levels of it this time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
now, Ning was mainly focusing on two goals in his training. The first
was to infuse the other Daos into his Eternal Omega Dao, while the
second was to create a perfect cultivation technique. In both cases,
his chances for success were extremely slim! As for the Heart of
Eternity, Autarch Awakener had poured his heart and soul into its
creation. Ning felt certain that spending some more time analyzing it
might be of benefit to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
Crack! Crack! Ning began to attempt to break through the various
layers, and the outermost layers quickly crumbled away before him.
Now that Ning had reached a much higher level of insight, he was able
to solve the seals much more quickly than before. He blew through the
lower levels like rotting deadwood, reaching the fiftieth level
almost instantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Level
fifty. Level sixty. Level seventy…</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_019__The"></A>
Chapter 19: Three Thousand Chaos Cycles</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next
to Ning was the elderly white-haired spirit of the Azureflower
Estate. The old man watched rather eagerly. “Daolord Darknorth may
have failed the Daomerge, but he gained control over the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao and reached a higher level of insight. There is some
time left before he dies and his Dao vanishes. Perhaps this time will
be enough for him to accomplish Master’s final wishes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ji Ning stared at the Heart of Eternity floating in front
of him and the seals covering them. Each time he broke through one
level of seals, he was able to see the next level and get to work on
it, and each time Ning gained a few new insights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because each layer of seals represented much of the wisdom
Autarch Awakener had gained over the process of devising the Nine
Chaos Seals. Ning’s insights were not on Autarch Awakener’s
levels, but he had such a high level of comprehension that when he
put some effort into it, his talent combined with the Autarch’s
stone dais and the Stonefire Pearl ensured that he could resolve the
simpler seals with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seventy-five.
Eighty. Eighty-five. Ninety…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was taking more and more time to solve each layer of seals. Each
layer of seals now gave him many new insights, making it increasingly
difficult for him to solve them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing else I can do.” Ning finally came to a halt. He had merely
spent a bit over five thousand years in solving the first ninety-two
seals, but he had then spent over a hundred thousand years without
improving even slightly. The boost given to him by his Eternal Omega
Sword Dao had done everything it could; he had blown through the
earlier levels with ease, but now he would need to slowly accumulate
new insights once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninety-two
levels… a total of ninety-nine.” Ning revealed a smile. “It
seems I have a chance at solving it before I die after all. I really
do want to see what Autarch Awakener hid in the Heart of Eternity,
for him to have put so much effort into setting up these levels of
seals. According to what the spirit of the estate said, the treasure
inside is just as valuable as the Stonefire Pearl!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had analyzed many Sithe techniques and also mastered the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao. These two different paths had allowed him to reach a
very high level of insight, and they would be of use to him in
breaking through the Heart of Eternity. He had only reached the
ninety-second level, but he had more than ten thousand chaos cycles
left to him. He still stood a chance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
leaving the Flamedragon Realmverse, Ning and his family spent a total
of over 1.2 billion years touring through the Chaosverse before
finally reaching their first ‘target’, the Flamesea Thunderfalls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
bolts of lightning came crashing down from the skies, so dense that
it looked like a vast waterfall of electricity. Below the lightning
was a layer of twisted spacetime, and when the waterfall of lightning
came crashing down upon the twisted spacetime, the resulting
collisions resulted in an enormous sea of fire having formed below.
This ‘sea’ just lay there in the void, utterly dazzling to
behold. As for the giant waterfall of lightning, it was over a
hundred million kilometers thick and looked almost like a vertical
pool of lightning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
truly was a stunning and beautiful sight, but it was also a deadly
one. The power of this place was so great that even the laws of the
Chaosverse were bent and twisted. This place was perhaps a bit weaker
than the Wellspring Sea of the Blazefire Domain, but it was mighty
enough to heavily injure Hegemons and obliterate Archon-level
Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a tiny little flying ship appeared in the void directly above the
flaming sea of the Flamesea Thunderfalls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the Flamesea Thunderfalls?” Brightmoon’s eyes widened as
she stared at the vast sea of fire in front of her and the endless
‘waterfall’ of lightning above her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Chaosverse truly is filled with endless marvels,” Subhuti sighed in
amazement. “The tiniest amount of power from that thing would
obliterate me instantly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let’s go inside and take a look,” Ning said. Boom! For the first
time in their journey, Ning unleashed his Sword Dao domain, causing
it to surround the realmship as they continued to fly forwards.
Brightmoon, Yuchi Snow, and Ji Yichuan were all stunned as they
watched themselves charge deep into the lightning waterfall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Dao domain stretched out to a distance of three thousand
meters, creating a true void which neither the lightning nor the fire
could penetrate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning sent the realmship sinking downwards, plunging through the
lightning until it reached the point where the lightning clashed
against the sea of fire. This was the place where the waterfall of
lightning collided against the distorted spacetime at such an
incredibly frenetic rate that the flaming sea was formed, something
which was just as powerful as the lightning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
natural power of the ‘Thunderfalls’ came from the primordial
chaos and was truly limitless, and the same was true for the
Flamesea. However, there was a limit to how far the power of the
Flamesea Thunderfalls could extend. At a certain point, the power
would dissipate and turn back into primordial chaos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the place where the Thunderfalls and the Flamesea meet, where the
lightning transforms and gives birth to flame. Brightmoon, focus on
your meditations. This place will benefit you greatly,” Ning said.
“While you are training here, you must remain within my domain. You
are not permitted to go beyond it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Brightmoon said obediently. Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, he had long ago ensured that this domain of three thousand
meters was completely separated from the outside world. There was no
way anything outside could come inside, but it was also impossible
for anyone inside to exit! He had given his daughter this stern
warning simply because he wanted to rein her in a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
daughter’s path was that of the Dao of Fire, and so Ning was
planning to stay here for an extended period of time. His daughter
was merely at the World level; his concern was that she wouldn’t be
patient enough to stay in any one place for an extended period of
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sat down by himself in the void, assuming the lotus position and
beginning to meditate silently. Yichuan and Snow relaxed within the
realmship too, sharing some fine food and wine while enjoying the
beautiful view in front of them. When they felt bored, they would
enter the estate-worlds they carried within them to have some fun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Su
Youji and Ji Brightmoon both trained in the Dao of Fire, and so both
of them went into meditation. Subhuti did the same, as he couldn’t
help but be filled with questions when he stared at the twisted
region of spacetime which actually produced fire when the water of
lightning slammed into it. He meditated attentively, and as he did he
gained many new insights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more you saw and the more of the Chaosverse you experienced, the
better you would understand how the Dao functioned in its many myriad
ways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
trained the fastest of all. It took him just two years of carefully
studying the Flamesea Thunderfalls for him to upgrade his Dao of
Lightning to the Hegemonic level. The reason why it hadn’t been
quite as fast as the Dao of Water was because Ning hadn’t
previously accumulated quite as many insights in Lightning as he had
in Water. However, his overwhelmingly high level of insight into his
Eternal Omega Dao made it quite easy for him to reach Hegemony in any
and all Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
another twelve years, Ning upgraded his Dao of Fire to the Hegemonic
level as well. Ning then turned his attention to the region of
twisted spacetime and began to ruminate on the Dao of Space. However,
the mysteries of space here were insufficiently incomplete, and so
Ning didn’t spend much time on it. There really wasn’t a need;
their next destination was the perfect place for them to meditate on
the Dao of Space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
simply understanding these Daos was easy. To fully absorb them into
his Eternal Omega Dao… now that would be the hard part.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Ning and his family spent a total of ninety-six chaos
cycles in the Flamesea Thunderfalls. Only when everyone felt that
there were no further insights they could gain did they depart from
this place and head towards their next destination. During the past
ninety-six chaos cycles, most of them had improved dramatically. Ning
had managed to successfully infuse his Dao of Lightning and his Dao
of Fire into his Eternal Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
continued their long excursion, going to many dangerous places where
they would spend extended periods of time in meditation. They merely
spent twenty or thirty chaos cycles in some places, while they spent
over a hundred chaos cycles in others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
places were all quite different. Some were truly dangerous, while
others were simply rather unique. In the blink of an eye, more than
three thousand chaos cycles had passed since they had departed from
the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
this period of time, Daolords Su Youji, Subhuti, and Windfiend had
all improved dramatically. Su Youji could sense that she could
attempt the Daomerge whenever she wanted… but of course, she wasn’t
certain as to whether or not she would succeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Subhuti
and Windfiend both were Daolords of the Fourth Step. Visiting all
these places had been of tremendous benefit to them, as was the
guidance on the Dao they had received from Ning and Hegemon
Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
of course… there was Brightmoon! She had now visited many places
which not even Otherverse Lords would have a chance to visit, places
which fully displayed the mysteries of how the Dao worked in keeping
the Chaosverse operating. Frankly speaking, Brightmoon had been given
far more opportunities than Ning ever had… but alas, she simply
hadn’t suffered enough setbacks or danger, and her talent was
inferior to Ning’s as well. She was just barely able to master a
single Supreme Dao, at which point Ning stopped trying to force
things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next…
Brightmoon used her Supreme Dao of Fire to become a Samsara Daolord,
and became a Daolord of the Third Step after a fairly brief period of
time! It was fairly easy for Daolords to break through in the early
stages, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y’know,
if Master put this much effort into training any of the true geniuses
of the Flamedragon Realmverse, I guarantee that they would probably
all reach the level of fusing multiple Supreme Daos together,”
Hegemon Azurefiend whispered to Su Youji. “Our little lady’s just
not that talented. Even if she succeeds in the Daomerge, she won’t
be able to become a Hegemon. Her father’s comparable to the
Autarchs!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“She’s
his daughter. Of course he’s going to pour all of his effort into
training her. Is he supposed to do the same for strangers?” Su
Youji said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
truly did put as much effort as he could into training his daughter.
He was also extremely studious in guiding his master Subhuti,
Windfiend, Su Youji, and his personal disciples. He also provided
some tips to Hegemon Azurefiend from time to time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for others?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
might be incredibly talented and have had incredible experiences…
but what the hell did any of that have to do with Ning? Ning couldn’t
be bothered with them, much like how none of the Autarchs had popped
up to guide Ning in the past, even though he was clearly an
incredible talent. Cultivators were self-interested at times, after
all.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_40_Chapter_020__The"></A>
Chapter 20: Greatland Planet</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was definitely going to do absolutely everything within his
power, acquiring treasures like the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, to
give his daughter Brightmoon the best possible chance at the
Daomerge. If she succeeded, before he died Ning would even ask an
Autarch to help find an otherverse for his daughter, letting
Brightmoon become an Otherverse Lord! This wasn’t completely
unheard of; the lord of the Church of Annihilation, for example,
wasn’t a Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this matter, Ning didn’t feel the slightest hint of shame at all.
Of course he had to look after his daughter’s interests!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the indescribably distant Wildsky Realmverse, there was a marvelous
place known as the Greatland Planet. Ning was training atop this
planet, while Brightmoon, Ji Yichuan, Yuchi Snow, Su Youji, the
Flamewing God, Subhuti, and Windfiend had all temporarily left to go
exploring the area around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why the others didn’t stay here was because this place, the
Greatland Planet, was quite special. This was a vast planet that was
over a hundred trillion kilometers in size. This was the largest
planet in all the Chaosverse, and it was formed by an incredibly
dense wave of Earth-element energy! The amount of power contained
within this single planet was actually comparable to that of the
entire Wildsky Realmverse! It was vast, dense, and teeming with life,
all thanks to the almighty power of Earth which flowed through it…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ordinary
cultivators would find it impossible to train here, as they would
find their mind and body disturbed by the overwhelming power of the
place!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
planet was also surrounded by a layer of deep yellow clouds which
were so thick and dense, one had to at least be a Hegemon in order to
bypass! Thus, there were virtually no cultivators here at all.
Although this vast world had given birth to countless living beings,
including many humanoids. These humanoids were quite talented,
strong, and attuned to the power of the earth, and many were even
born with the ability to control the earth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
there was no way for them to actually cultivate! This was because all
other Daos had to give this place a wide birth. Even the Dao of Earth
itself was hidden deep within the recesses of the world. Even
Hegemons would find it very hard to train in the Dao of Earth here.
Only someone who was at as high a level of enlightenment as Ning
would be able to scry the many secrets hidden deep underground. How
could the ordinary mortals here possibly embark upon the path of
cultivation?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
completed the Dao of Earth as well.” A white-robed youth was seated
on a patch of grass in front of a thatched cottage within a mountain
gorge. A smile was on his face as he reached out with both hands.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Swords began to appear out of
nowhere, numbering five in total.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first sword was covered with a layer of flowing, watery light. The
second gleamed a faint metallic color, appearing to be indescribably
sharp. The third emanated a green aura of life and vitality. The
fourth was surrounded by tendrils of flame which gave it utterly
explosive power. As for the fifth and final sword, it was covered
with a layer of deep yellow light and it seemed weighty beyond
measure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Water Sword Dao, the Metal Sword Dao, the Wood Sword Dao, the Fire
Sword Dao, the Earth Sword Dao.” Ning nodded. “The Five Elements
are now complete. As I thought, it has been somewhat beneficial to my
truesoul.” However, Ning also noticed that his improvements in the
Dao were suffering from diminishing returns when it came to
nourishing his truesoul. This was particularly true now that he had
many truesoul treasures; to further slow down the rate of crumbling
was becoming increasingly difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
infused the Dao of Lightning and the Five Elements into my Eternal
Omega Sword Dao, making for six in total. The Dao of Space should be
finished soon as well.” Ning felt a sense of pressure, because
infusing the Dao of Space had been noticeably more difficult. He had
long ago reached Hegemony in the Dao of Space, but infusing it was
extremely difficult. As for the Dao of Time and the Dao of Karma,
those would be even more difficult and would definitely require more
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Great
Immortal, please save my grandson!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Great
Immortal, I beg of you, save my grandson! So long as you save him,
I’ll do anything you want.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
faint sound could be heard coming from afar. Ning frowned, glancing
past the material obstruction of the mountain to see an elderly
white-haired man who was on his knees in front of a cliff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were no cultivators in the entire Greatland Planet, and so Ning
didn’t see the need to set up any complicated wards to surround his
training canyon. He had merely set up something to prevent people
from coming in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
he that kid’s great-grandson?” When Ning saw the white-haired
elder, he immediately remembered something from two hundred years
ago. Back then, there had been a kid who had accidentally fallen down
from the cliff and into the gorge where Ning had been training.
Ning’s wards were quite benign, but for an ordinary child to fall
from that height spelled almost certain doom. Ning had moved to save
that little child, who had immediately kowtowed and offered thanks to
the ‘Great Immortal’ who had rescued him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since the child had grown up, he had often come to the mountain to
offer sacrifices and pay his respects to the ‘Great Immortal’.
Ning really didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, especially when
the kid ended up bringing his own children and grandchildren to do
the same!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was able to immediately recognize this white-haired elder as the
great-grandson of the original child.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ordinary
mortals only live for a mere century. Multiple generations of your
family have knelt down towards me… and today, I just so happened to
finish some of my training. I suppose it can be said that there are
karmic ties between us.” Ning took a single step forwards and
appeared at the top of the cliff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder was still on his knees, calling out for mercy.
Suddenly, he froze and stared in amazement as a white-robed youth
appeared in front of him. The youth was ephemerally graceful and was
clearly no ordinary mortal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Great
Immortal!” The white-haired elder was incredibly excited. “I beg
of you, save my grandson!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kid,
your hair’s gone all white.” Ning chuckled. “Your grandson, eh?
Is that him over there?” Ning was able to see the karmic ties
swirling around the elder and was thus immediately able to locate his
grandson.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved a single finger, causing the white mist surrounding the cliff
to suddenly condense into an image of a swarthy, muscular youth
dressed in tattered clothes within a mine. He was carrying a load of
minerals on his back; clearly, he had been working as a miner. The
area around him was surrounded with ore, and an overseer was next to
him with a whip in hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
Rocky! That’s my grandson Rocky!” the white-haired elder said
excitedly. “That’s the Mine of Doom! No one who goes in there
ever survives to come back. Great Immortal, please save my grandson!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
one who goes in can survive?” Ning stared at the images in the
mist, then chuckled: “You underestimate your grandson.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was able to see the youth’s future. If Ning didn’t interfere, the
youth would slowly rise to power within the mines and become a
powerful expert. He would be extremely hard-working and devoted to
his training, and would reach the apex of what little ‘cultivation’
was possible within this planet. In the end, he would die a lonely
death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
it was impossible for the beings in this planet to engage in true
cultivation, there were many who were born with natural power over
the earth and who would thus be capable of some simple cultivation
techniques… but even at the apex of power, they wouldn’t be even
close to the Earth Immortal level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
daresay your grandson has the unyielding heart of a true cultivator,”
Ning chuckled. “A pity that it’ll all go to waste in a place like
the Greatland Planet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning continued to view the youth’s past and future, he began to
take a liking to the kid. In fact, Ning started to consider taking
him on as an apprentice… and just a short while later, Ning settled
on making the kid his eighth apprentice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
there’s no rush. I should let him experience some more difficulties
in life first. In the future, his Dao-heart only became decent after
he became lonely in his invincibility,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
back and live your life. Don’t worry, I promise your grandson will
come back alive and perfectly well. You’ll be able to see him one
last time roughly ten years from now,” Ning said. The beings in
this world were at most able to live a bit over a hundred years. Ning
wasn’t going to make any alterations, but the old man was still
going to live a long life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-y-yes,
Great Immortal!” After witnessing the incredible abilities of the
‘Great Immortal’ and hearing his promise, the white-haired elder
became hopeful and energetic. He returned to his own home and began
to wait for his grandson to return.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to watch from afar as this ‘disciple’ continued to grow and
develop. Finally, the day came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
wandered the four corners of the earth and have visited many
countries, defeating all who sought to challenge me. Is this truly
it?” A swarthy man dressed in hemp clothes was standing at the peak
of a mountain, staring at the vast world below him. He had a thick
saber on his back, and a look of loneliness was in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
becoming truly invincible, he felt a sense of extremely uncomfortable
loneliness. He truly did wish to find a good opponent, but he had
been unable to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
I should find a good place to bring my life to an end.” The swarthy
man shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
A loud laugh rang out, followed by a white-robed youth appearing from
nowhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
swarthy man stared in shock. Given his control over the earth and his
current level of power, how was it that someone could appear next to
him without him even noticing?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…”
The swarthy man stared at the white-robed youth. He suddenly thought
of a painting his grandfather had once owned and forced him to kowtow
towards. Supposedly, the person in the painting was the legendary
‘Great Immortal’ their clan often spoke of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Great
Immortal?” the swarthy man said hesitantly, not quite believing it.
He then drew his saber with a clanging sound as he stared at Ning:
“Senior, you might be more powerful than me… but I’d still like
you to give me a few pointers in combat.” After speaking, he
delivered a furious saber-chop towards Ning, confident that his
control over the saber was enough to ensure that he could bring it to
an instant halt without harming the person in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
swarthy man suddenly flew backwards, almost as though time had just
gone backwards. Even his saber flew back into his sheath, and he even
said in reverse: “Em naht lufrewop erom eb thgim uoy…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
bizarre scene caused him to be truly stupefied and dazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you willing to be my apprentice?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
swarthy man was indescribably excited. He immediately fell to his
knees: “Stonepool kowtows to you, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “From this day forth, you shall be the eighth disciple
under the tutelage of myself, ‘Darknorth’. If there are any
affairs in the mortal world you wish to wrap up, hurry up and take
care of it. After doing so, you shall accompany me in departing from
this planet… and you shall have the chance to face the true world
of cultivation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Daolord Darknoth’s eighth disciple, ‘Stonepool’, formally
entered his tutelage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is time for me to leave.” Ning raised his head to stare into the
skies. He had the vague feeling that something just happened, and
that he would no longer be able to continue this relaxed life.</P>
