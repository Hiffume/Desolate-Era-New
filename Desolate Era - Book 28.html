Chapter 1 – The World Within the Archaeus Region
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus region was
the core of this entire alternate universe. According to legend, it
was the place where this universe itself had originated from, and it
was filled with both danger and opportunity. Every single World-level
cultivator would be berserk for the chance to enter it, and even
Daolords would vie for the chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five streaks of light
flew into the cloudy mists at the borders of the Archaeus region,
delving deeper and deeper inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you sense it?”
Skyfire Brightshore sent a rather excited mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Firesurge
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a unique
sensation.” Heartlord Solewind nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It truly is quite
marvelous.” Prince Greatjoy sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was amazed as well
as he carefully attuned himself to these sensations. Ever since he
had flown into the Archaeus region, he had been able to sense an
invisible aura of power which completely covered the entire region.
This power was the power of the Archaeus region itself. If the five
of them didn’t have access to an Archaeus medallion, they probably
would’ve been instantaneously crushed into dust. They could sense
that this mighty power originated from some place at the very heart
of the vast Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That direction,
there.” Skyfire Brightshore pointed towards the distance. “That’s
the place we need to go to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heart of the
Archaeus region.” Ning and the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The star maps had
included a detailed path from the transversal conduit to the Archaeus
region. However, after they actually entered the Archaeus region they
would have to depend on their own senses to advance towards the heart
of the region! The center of the Archaeus region was a place which
every cultivator dreamed of entering. Perhaps the journey would
result in some adventures that would test them and allow them to grow
more powerful and evolve, but the center… that was the place where
the true transformation would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen, same
rules as always. I’ll be the one to teleport us,” Prince Greatjoy
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to trouble
you, brother Greatjoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others did
not decline. It must be understood that the Archaeus region was most
likely as large as the entire Endless Territories. To go from the
border regions to its heart would probably take trillions of years if
one wished to physically fly through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Ning had long ago sworn a lifeblood oath to reach Vastheaven
Palace within a single chaos cycle. Chaos cycles, however, were
extremely long and were calculated in the trillions of years! Thus,
Ning still had plenty of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy
produced a flying vessel which Ning and the others then entered.
Prince Greatjoy took personal control over the vessel, sending it
hurtling through the Archaeus region at high speeds as he teleported
again and again. Every single spatial teleportation allowed them to
cover an extremely great distance. Given Prince Greatjoy’s mastery
over the Dao of Spacetime, roughly a hundred teleportations would be
enough to allow them to traverse a single territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the ‘normal’
universe, territories were located extremely far away from each
other. The distance between two territories could be a hundred times
greater than the size of each territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what my
senses are telling me… the heart of the Archaeus region is quite
far away from us. If we keep teleporting like this, it’ll take us
at least ten thousand years to reach it,” Prince Greatjoy said.
“That is assuming, of course, that we don’t encounter any
dangers. In reality, this place will be full of danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just keep
advancing step by step,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll fight fire
with fire,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second day after
they entered the Archaeus region. They had just performed yet another
spatial teleportation. When the shuttle came to a halt…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look.”
Prince Greatjoy’s face tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
others looked over. Ning stared past a faint layer of mist and was
able to see an utterly enormous continent floating in space. Although
there was a barrier of mist between them, Ning was still able to see
out to a distance of a billion kilometers. He instantly saw that this
continent had a few figures residing within it. He was able to make
out a few dozen figures in total.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivators?” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dozens of them? Why
are there so many?” Prince Greatjoy was surprised as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what they
knew, one had to have an Archaeus medallion in order to enter the
Archaeus region. This was true even for weaker cultivators like Elder
Gods, Ancestral Immortals, True Gods, or True Immortals. Anyone who
didn’t have a medallion would be crushed by the power of the
Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very, very
few Archaeus medallions. They had spent a thousand years travelling
through many different territories, and as a result they had come to
understand just how rare these items were! Logically speaking, it
should’ve been almost impossible for them to encounter large
numbers of cultivators bearing Archaeus medallions because of how
rare those things were and how vast the Archaeus region was. They had
only expected to encounter other cultivators after they actually
entered the heart of the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something doesn’t
make sense. They… they give me an odd feeling.” Heartlord
Solewind shook his head slowly. “It feels as though the invisible
power of the Archaeus region is protecting them, rather than
oppressing them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That really
does seem to be the case.” The others quickly noticed this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had entered
bearing Archaeus medallions, and so the Archaeus region did not harm
them. However… those dozens of distant figures were actually being
supported and protected by the power of the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are moving very
slowly,” Ning sent mentally. “In fact, they are flying at
ridiculously slow speeds. Most likely, even average Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals would fly much faster than them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vessel slowly
advanced towards the borders of that vast, levitating continent. Ning
and the others all flew out of the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
Heartlord Solewind stared hard at a nearby figure who was merely
three hundred million kilometers away. He sent an invisible wave of
heartforce out to completely cover that figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is very weak.
He’s an ordinary mortal who hasn’t even undergone the Celestial
Tribulation. Strictly speaking, he would be considered at the
Wanxiang level,” Heartlord Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mortal?” Ning
and the others were all surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms, it
was said that after surviving the Celestial Tribulation, one would be
‘no longer subject to the rules of the Three Realms and the fetters
of the Five Elements’. Prior to overcoming the tribulation, one
would be constrained by the rules of that world. These people were
referred to as ‘mortals’ by powerful cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there actually
mortals who live here in the Archaeus region?” Ning and the others
were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a look
and see,” Heartlord Solewind said. He took a single step forwards,
causing the space around him to shimmer as he teleported three
hundred million kilometers and moved close to that distant mortal
lifeform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a look
as well.” The others all teleported forwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Rainskill was
riding on a magic treasure as she engaged in careful exploration. She
could be considered a beautiful woman who was quite famous. In just a
hundred short years, she had reached the Core Formation stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m now in the
deeprest reaches of the Western Wastes.” Daoist Rainskill was
extremely cautious. “I hear that at the end of the Western Wastes
lies the endless chaos storms. I’ve never seen the chaos storms
before. I was lucky enough to be teleported deep into the Western
Wastes… I can’t waste this chance to check it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bald man dressed in
fiery robes suddenly appeared in the air directly above the marsh in
front of Daoist Rainskill. Moments later, several other figures
appeared as well. There was a youth dressed in deep blue robes, a
white-robed youth carrying a sword on his back, a black-robed man who
wore a crown on his head, and a youth with long, crimson hair. All of
them looked extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? They can
actually teleport straight into the Western Wastes?” Daoist
Rainskill was badly startled. The Western Wastes was a chaotic place
that was quite close to the endless chaos storms. Space was extremely
unstable here. Only the ‘Grand Cultivators’ were able to teleport
in places like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainskill pays her
respects to you all, seniors.” Daoist Rainskill was extremely
respectful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We wish to ask you
some questions.” Solewind smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without even realizing
it, Daoist Rainskill began to relax. In her heart, she began to view
this man as person who she completed trusted. “Ask away, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How large is this
continent? How many living beings does it hold?” Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is the
Northspring Continent. It is unimaginably vast and holds countless
living beings,” Daoist Rainskill said. “The number of cultivators
and monsters in this place is numerous beyond count, much less
mortals and ordinary beasts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged looks, all rather surprised. There were actually countless
living beings here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this place here
is the Western Wastes. Space is distorted here, making it impossible
for mortals to survive in such a place. Only cultivators would dare
to delve deep into this place,” Daoist Rainskill said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the highest
level of cultivation in this continent?” Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, you have the
Qi Condensation stage. Then, you have the Foundation stage. Next
comes the Core Formation stage… and the highest stage is the
‘Tribulation’ stage,” Daoist Rainskill said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest stage is
the ‘Tribulation’ stage?” Solewind followed up on this. “There
are none stronger than the ‘Tribulation’ stage? What happens
after the tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the
tribulation, you ascend, of course!” Daoist Rainskill said, “You
ascend to the Immortal realm. There’s no way back from there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any
continents aside from the Northspring Continent?” Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are. If you go
through the ancient transfer arrays, you can reach some other
continents,” Daoist Rainskill said. “From our Northspring
Continent, we can reach an incredibly distant continent known as the
Blackfiend Continent as well as a place known as the Astral Ocean. I
don’t know about any other locations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Heartlord Solewind nodded slowly, then looked at the others. “Let’s
go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded, quickly disappearing as they left this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Daoist
Rainskill felt her mind go blurry for a moment. “What the hell? I
actually started to daydream in a place like this?” She had no
recollection of her meeting with Ning’s group at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… I feel very
comfortable right now.” Daoist Rainskill felt a very comfortable
feeling permeate through her entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! I’ve
reached the peak of the Core Formation stage? And why does it seem as
though my body has been completely transformed?” Daoist Rainskill
was now truly stunned. What she didn’t know was that Heartlord
Solewind had given her a glance as he left, bestowing a small parting
gift upon her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning’s group,
they now stood once more at the margins of this vast continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that the Archaeus region can give birth to living creatures
as well,” Ning mused softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any environment can
potentially give birth to living beings,” Solewind sent back. “The
almighty Hegemon captured quite a few cultivators from this universe
but was only able to learn a few things about the Archaeus region. It
makes sense that there is a great deal of information we were unaware
of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, they tested
out the process of teleporting some people from the estate-worlds
they held. They had all brought out people who had committed
tremendous sins and were viledoers. Unexpectedly, all of them were
able to survive here in the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, that young
lady spoke of ‘ascending’ to the Immortal realm after the
tribulation.” Prince Greatjoy’s eyes narrowed. “As you all
know, once you overcome the tribulation you’ll escape the rules and
confines of a world. That means you will no longer be protected by
the Archaeus region itself. Without an Archaeus medallion, you’d be
instantly crushed to death. Most likely, those ascendants all
‘ascended’ to certain estate-worlds which are probably under the
control of major powers who live here in the Archaeus region. In
other words… it is very likely that behind this continent is a
Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord?” Ning
and the others nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms or
other chaosworlds, those who ascended and became Immortals or Gods
would still be able to come and visit the mortal lands. However, here
in the Archaeus region there was no coming back from ascension.
Clearly, this was all due to the power of the Archaeus region, which
ensured there was no way for them to return. If they wished to
survive, they would only be able to do so by living in estate-world
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group
naturally wouldn’t worry about them… but Daolords were definitely
worthy of their attention and concern!
</P>

Chapter 2 – Spatial Tempests
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s also possible
that I’m just overthinking things,” Solewind said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There may be many
things in the Archaeus region unknown to us.” None of them dared
claim they knew everything about this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Did the mortals of the
Archaeus region go to a Daolord’s estate-world after ascending, or
did they go into some other special place? None of them were certain.
Still, they had to remain vigilant. Given their current level of
power, battles against Daolords were still quite risky for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Prince Greatjoy sent. Ji Ning and the others re-entered his flying
vessel, then quietly and stealthily departed from this enormous
continent and continued their journey via teleportation through the
Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year. Ten years. A
hundred years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
continued to advance carefully. The Archaeus region truly was the
core of this entire alternate universe, the place from which
everything had first arisen. This place was filled with countless
marvels and dangers as well as quite a few precious treasures. Ning’s
group, however, didn’t dare to be too greedy. They did their best
to avoid as many danger zones as they could, but they still
encountered trouble on quite a few occasions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly 1308 years
after they had entered the Archaeus region, they encountered an
extremely powerful Daolord! They had come incredibly close to dying
that time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been
teleporting through space using their flying vessel when all of a
sudden, they discovered a green-robed Daolord had suddenly appeared a
few billion kilometers up ahead of them. This Daolord was quite ugly,
with white eyebrows hanging down all the way to his chest. He was
leisurely strolling through the emptiness of space, but when he saw
Ning’s flying vessel appear a look of murder appeared in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That glare alone gave
all five of them a sensation of tremendous danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All five of them could
sense death impending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahh!” Prince
Greatjoy furiously sent his vessel into an immediate teleport.
Swoosh! Right after his vessel disappeared, a sharp thread-like
streak of light lashed through the empty space where the vessel had
been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
green-robed Daolord’s gaze was cold as he relased his godsense to
inspect the surrounding area of a trillion kilometers. “They ran
quite quickly. I wonder which master they are apprenticed to.” The
green-robed Daolord let out a cold snort, then walked away and
disappeared from the scene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although that
interaction had been a very brief one, Ning’s group remained
terrified by the memory of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Daolord was
definitely at the Verge of the Daomerge! Although Daolords are quite
rare here in the Archaeus region, there’s still more of them than
World-level cultivators. Many World-level cultivators have entered
then exited the Archaeus region, with almost none of them actually
staying here for an extended period of time! Given how vast the
Archaeus region is, we have a much higher chance of running into
Daolords than into other World-level cultivators.” Solewind shook
his head. “Still, I never would’ve thought we would run into a
Daolord just a thousand years after entering the Archaeus region.
Worse, it was a shameless Daolord who immediately moved to attack us
and steal our Archaeus medallions. Thank goodness brother Greatjoy
was here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That old bastard was
very powerful. If I had been just a bit slower, we wouldn’t have
been able to escape.” Prince Greatjoy also felt fear at what had
nearly happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all thanks to
you, brother Greatjoy.” Ning was still petrified as well. If they
had actually been forced to fight… even though Ning had those four
guardian golems protecting him, there was no way he would’ve been
able to defeat a Verge-level Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That near-brush with
death had caused their souls and truesouls to all quiver with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be in a ‘relaxed’
state or to be in a ‘tense’ state where you straddled the line
between life and death were two completely separate concepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You might spend
multiple chaos cycles in a relaxed state without making any
improvements, but just one or two life-and-death adventures might be
enough to result in dramatic gains in strength! To live a peaceful
life for countless years, or to straddle the line between life and
death as you reached for greater glory and greater heights? Clearly,
the majority of cultivators chose the latter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than 2800 years
had passed since Ning’s group had entered the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s charge
through!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
were all aboard their flying vessel, using all their power to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were surrounded by
countless spatial tempests, and their flying vessel was being tossed
about by the spatial storms like an ordinary vessel might be tossed
about by giant waves. They were completely unable to fight back as
the spatial tempests pressed them forwards nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
still trying their best to resist, and Ning himself sent out an
enormous streak of sword-light to tear a spatial tempest apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge sent out
enormous waves of water to crash out against those spatial tempests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore had
been growing noticeably more powerful ever since he had entered this
alternate universe. He was now working alongside Firesurge, and the
two were combining their skills in fire and water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatjoy and Solewind
were doing their best as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel was
still being buffeted and tossed about by the spatial tempests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t work. We
can’t charge through.” Prince Greatjoy shook his head. “The
difference in power between us and these spatial tempests is too
great. These spatial tempests are simply too violent. Even my control
over spacetime won’t be enough to calm them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Firesurge
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just go with
the flow, then.” Solewind chuckled. “This isn’t exactly the
first time we ran into something like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well,
then laughed, “These spatial tempests won’t always maintain such
a high level of strength. If we just follow the flows, eventually
we’ll reach a spot where things calm down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus region was
filled with many dangers, and they had encountered spatial tempests
on quite a few occasions by now. Although Ning, Solewind, and the
others all had certain trump cards they could use, these naturally
occurring phenomena really weren’t worth the cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They ended up following
the flows of the spatial tempests for nine more months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spatial tempests
are actually growing stronger and stronger.” Prince Greatjoy
continued to helm the flying vessel through the storms, seeking a
relatively easier ‘path’ for them to traverse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, look over
there!” Prince Greatjoy suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Land.” Ning and
the others turned to stare as well, only to see an utterly enormous
continent hanging in the void just past the spatial tempests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually
land here? Hopefully this continent will have actual people living on
it.” Ning and the others revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning and the others all descended upon the great continent. The edges
of this continent were surrounded by strange whirlpools of power that
continuously weakened the spatial storms that swept towards the
continent. By the time they made it a few billion kilometers into the
heart of the continent, things were completely calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An ancient, major
power has passed by this continent before.” Ning’s group advanced
through a desolate desert. This place was still considered as being
part of the ‘border regions’ of this continent. The environs were
quite harsh and not suitable for life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
raised his head and stared off into the distance. “I can dimly
sense that this entire continent is covered by an enormous formation
which is diverting the power of those spatial tempests. This
formation must’ve been left behind by a major power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, a major power
has been here.” Prince Greatjoy stared towards a place roughly a
billion kilometers away. “This continent is filled with countless
living beings. It is very likely that this continent holds a
spacetime transfer array.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it’ll be
much easier for us to leave if we can move through a spacetime
transfer array.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember that time
from five hundred years ago, when we were trapped in that sea of fire
and unable to escape? In the end, we discovered that there was
actually a continent located deep within the sea of fire.” Skyfire
Brightshore couldn’t help but reminisce about this. “That
continent was also filled with many living beings, and it also had a
spacetime transfer array. It even had an estate left behind by a
Daolord. Thankfully, that Daolord had left long ago, and so we were
able to easily enter the spacetime transfer array and reach a
different area. It actually shortened our journey considerably.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded. By now, they had spent nearly three thousand years in the
Archaeus region, and they had accumulated a great deal of experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus region was
filled with countless continents that were in turn filled with many
living beings. Small continents were generally ten billion kilometers
in size, while larger ones could be a trillion kilometers in size!
There were often traces of ancient major powers having passed through
these places, albeit very few of them would actually set up
residence. There was no point in living alongside ordinary mortals,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, virtually
every single continent with living beings on it had a spacetime
transfer array!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group,
however, didn’t dare to randomly use those arrays without doing
some careful investigations. They’d rather continuously teleport
through the Archaeus region than accidentally run into a reclusive
Daolord who was residing within one of those continents!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope things work
out this time,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Darknorth. Even if there are Daolords residing in this continent,
Daolords often go into closed-door meditation sessions that last a
million years or more. We’ll move in and depart immediately.
There’s no way we’ll be unlucky enough to run into one,”
Greatjoy chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just be careful,
everyone. Don’t randomly send out your godsense to search this
place,” Solewind warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you swept a region
with godsense, you might be able to discover a Daolord… but that
Daolord would also discover you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
advanced through the continent, quickly reaching a place which was
bustling with life and activity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was a city
known as Thousand Mountains, a place where the eight major sects of
the region all recruited disciples from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the city of Thousand
Mountains resided an old freak known as ‘Old Demon Qixiu’. He
truly was the number one expert of this region, superior to all
others in the eight major sects. However, he was a very low-key
figure who very few people knew about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” As the
Old Demon walked out of his room and through his estate, quite a few
servants and retainers would call out to him with respect when they
saw him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. This world
places enormous restrictions on my power.” The Old Demon’s gaze
drifted off into the distance as he stared at the mountain ranges
outside the city of Thousand Mountains. “And yet, I really just
can’t bear to leave…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Old
Demon’s face suddenly turned pale. Five figures had suddenly
appeared next to the lake nearby him. They were Ning, Solewind, and
the others.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the five,
Old Demon Qixiu could sense that his very soul was beginning to
shudder. He swallowed, hard, then bowed and said respectfully,
“Greetings, five seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens! He stood
at the very peak of power in this world. By all rights, he should’ve
been invincible, and yet… why was it that these five were
unfathomably more powerful than him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a few
questions for you,” Heartlord Solewind said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please ask, senior.”
The Old Demon was quite cautious, but even he himself didn’t
realize that deep within his heart, a seed of trust was beginning to
blossom towards this bald, red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the name of
this continent?” Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This continent is
quite vast, stretching hundreds of billions of kilometers,” the Old
Demon said. “Because there are so many mortals living here, we
refer to this continent as the Mortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind nodded slowly.
“Has anyone ever left this ‘Mortal Realm’ and ventured off into
other continents?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s only one
way to do that. You’d have to activate the ancient transfer array
and head to the the Sacred Immortal Realm,” the Old Demon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sacred Immortal
Realm?” Solewind asked. Upon hearing this, Ji Ning, Greatjoy,
Firesurge, and Skyfire all revealed smiles. They were going to be
able to leave this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire continent
was surrounded by spatial tempests, making it impossible for them to
leave. Only by using a spatial transfer array to go to another
continent would they be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This entire
continent holds just a single transfer array within it,” the Old
Demon said. “Supposedly, an incredibly long period of time ago
there was a major power from the Sacred Immortal Realm who descended
upon this continent who personally set up the array. There’s no way
for the cultivators of our Mortal Realm to come up with such a
complicated array.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
laughed. Most likely, this spacetime transfer array leading to the
Sacred Immortal Realm was something which had been personally
established by an extremely powerful Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here in our Mortal
Realm, the elemental energy of Heaven and Earth is very sparse. It is
incredible if you can even reach the Nascent Soul stage. To reach the
Apotheosis stage is even more difficult.” The Old Demon continued,
“Thus, countless Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis
cultivators shall gather from throughout the continent and travel
through the array towards the Sacred Immortal Realm. According to the
Apotheosis cultivators who came back from that place, the elemental
energy there is far denser than it is here in our Mortal Realm,
making it easier to cultivate and easier to overcome the
tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Nascent Soul’,
‘Apotheosis’… these were different terms for Ki Refiners. In
the Three Realms, the mortal ranks were Zifu Disciple, Wanxiang
Adept, Primal Daoists, and Void-level cultivator. This represented
what the most perfect Ki Refining systems in the Three Realms could
accomplish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the Endless
Territories and in this alternate universe there were many different
mortal races that used different Ki Refining techniques which had
different terms and titles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the
transfer array?” Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is a map.”
The Old Demon immediately took out his treasured map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind glanced at it
while simultaneously flipping through the Old Demon’s memories,
wiping away all traces of this encounter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave,”
Solewind said. The five immediately vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
Old Demon Qi Xiu stared at his surroundings. “Why do I have the
feeling that something is off…” The Old Demon frowned but wasn’t
able to comprehend what had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Afterwards, Ning’s
group chatted with two other Apotheosis cultivators who were
considered extremely powerful in this continent. Everything they said
was roughly the same as what the Old Demon had said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them road
atop a cloud, staring down at the lands below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true that the
elemental energy in this continent is quite sparse.” Ning nodded.
“It is true that mortal cultivators would find it very hard to
train here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there was no
elemental energy at all, there would be no way to cultivate
whatsoever. The elemental energy in this continent was only enough
for someone to just barely reach the Primal Daoist stage. If you
wished to reach the Void level and become an Earth Immortal, it would
be extremely difficult. The ‘Old Demon’ which Ning’s group had
questioned would’ve been considered a Void-level Earth Immortal in
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is because of the
formation which covers this entire place,” Solewind said. “This
formation covers everything, drawing power from the entire continent.
That’s why the elemental energy in this continent is so sparse!
Still, the reason this continent is protected from the spatial
tempests is because of this formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sacred Immortal
Realm should be a continent where the density of elemental energy is
normal,” Firesurge said. “However… as a result, the living
creatures here refer to it as the ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When there’s a
difference in density of elemental energy, it’s only normal that
there one realm is viewed as higher and one realm is viewed as
lower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
chatted as they advanced through the clouds and moved towards the
ancient transfer array. They stared at it from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient transfer
array took up an extremely wide amount of space. The entire formation
itself covered hundreds of millions of kilometers, and its core
components were extremely complicated and exquisite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is a
spacetime transfer array.” Ning and the others were able to
recognize it at one glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahah. Quite lively
here.” Prince Greatjoy glanced downwards, then let out a surprised
sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These so-called
‘Nascent Soul’ cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators really are
frighteningly numerous.” Solewind let out a laugh. This was the
only spacetime transfer array within the entire continent. As a
result, this place naturally attracted countless Nascent Soul
cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators from throughout the continent,
making it very bustling. In fact, an enormous city had been erected
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This city was filled to
the brim with Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators.
There had to be hundreds of millions of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
feel secretly amazed. This continent was hundreds of billions of
kilometers in size, making it much vaster than the entirety of the
Three Realms. Although in quality of elemental energy it was inferior
to the Three Realms, its vastness resulted in the existence of
hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis
cultivators. Any one of them would be considered a local hegemon when
scattered in any of the other places in this continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s enter the
city.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
walked through the city, moving directly towards the transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been trapped
at the Nascent Soul level for far too long. The density of elemental
energy in Heaven and Earth is simply too low. I failed both of my
attempts at reaching Apotheosis. Once I enter the Sacred Immortal
Realm, I’ll be able to reach Apotheosis. I might even have a chance
at overcoming my tribulation and reaching ascension!” The various
cultivators in the city were chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve become an
early-stage Apotheosis cultivator, but I’m not able to improve any
further. There just isn’t enough elemental energy here. Perhaps
I’ll be able to become a Celestial Immortal once I go to the Sacred
Immortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This array only
activates once every hundred years. I have to wait sixty-one more
years. This really does make me impatient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve waited
thousands of years, my brother. What’s another few decades?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the
countless cultivators in the city were filled with eagerness. They
had already reached the end of the path they could traverse here
within the ‘Mortal Realm’. Only in the Sacred Immortal Realm
would they have a chance to continue their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But none of them
realized that those five seemingly-ordinary men who just walked past
them were major powers who were truly capable of virtually anything!
Even those ‘Celestial Immortals’ they dreamed of becoming would
be wiped out in the billions by these five cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once every century?”
Skyfire Brightshore frowned. “This spacetime transfer array only
activates once every century?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each activation uses
up some energy. When this spacetime transfer array was created by
that ancient power, only a few chaos jewels were left behind to guide
it in gathering the surrounding natural energy into itself. It takes
a century for it to accumulate enough energy to be activated,”
Heartlord Solewind said. “My guess is that the Sacred Immortal
Realm is located extremely close to this continent, which is why the
activation can be as frequent as once every century. If it was
farther away, it would probably be once every thousand years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded. This was different from the spacetime transfer arrays of the
Endless Territories; if you were willing to pay enough chaos nectar,
it could be activated for you whenever you wished! This array here in
the alternate universe had been created by a major power, apparently
out of an act of selflessness. Of course, it was also possible that
this was done by the Church of Annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We’ll
first find a place to wait it out. Sixty-one years from now, we’ll
come back,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no other
choices.” Skyfire felt quite resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was possible for
them to pour energy into the formation and activate it by force, but…
once they did so and the transfer array became active, any reclusive
Daolord in either this continent or the Sacred Immortal Realm would
immediately realize that something was wrong! For the array to
suddenly fire off before the hundred year mark had to mean that
something had happened. Thus, they had no choice but to wait
patiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this continent,
there was a place known as ‘Wintermount’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
secluded themselves here within the mountains forests, occasionally
sipping wine, fishing, and sparring. Life was quite relaxing as they
waited for the spacetime transfer array to activate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fishing pole flicked
upwards, followed by a fat fish being yanked out of the surface of
the water. It fell down onto the bank, still flopping furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we’ll have
fish soup tonight.” Ning put the fishing pole on his back as he
walked through the forests. For the past thirty-plus years, he had
lived the life of an ordinary mortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.
A series of sounds rang out from afar. Curious, Ning walked in that
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A young man dressed in
simple clothes whose temples were graying was seated there, using a
wooden drill to drill into a piece of wood. As the wooden drill
ground away, those grinding, rumbling sounds could be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never met you
before.” Ning laughed. “You new?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just moved here.”
The gray-templed youth raised his head to smile towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At such a young age,
you’ve chosen to live by yourself in a desolate mountain
wilderness, rather than in a city or a mountain village. How odd.”
Ning hefted his fishing pole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sometimes, being by
yourself is better,” the young man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but laugh. How intriguing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could tell that this
youth was less than thirty years of age, but his eyes were as calm
and as deep as the sea. He clearly had an extraordinary heart that
was far more formidable than that of many Nascent Soul cultivators or
even Apotheosis cultivators. This gave Ning a completely different
way of viewing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Darknorth. I live just a few kilometers away from here. What’s your
name?” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Green
Bamboo,” the youth said, continuing to use his wooden drill.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 – Brightmoon Sword-Art, Blood Drop Sword-Intent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The young man continued
to spin his wooden drill across that piece of wood, leaving behind
one hole after another as bits of wooden detritus went flying abaout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning held his fish
bucket in one hand and his fishing pole in the other. His gaze was
focused on that spinning wooden drill, and he stared at it as though
time itself had stood still for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The young man
glanced at Ning in puzzlement. Was this simple tool of his really
that interesting? Still, he didn’t say anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The faster you rush,
the slower you go?” As Ning stared at that wooden drill, a look of
reflection was in his gaze. “Perhaps I should try something else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light began to
shimmer within Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had left
the Brightshore Kingdom four thousand years ago and entered this
alternate universe, he had experienced countless dangers. Skyfire
Brightshore’s level of power had been increasing quite rapidly and
noticeably, while Ning and the others were improving much more
slowly! Ever since Ning had gained insight into his Yin-Yang Sword
Domain, he had been meditating on his other four stances. Alas, he
hadn’t been able to make a fundamental breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. Rumble. The
wooden drill continued to bore holes into that piece of wood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s nothing more
than an ordinary mortal. If he wanted to use a knife to cut a hole in
that piece of wood, he wouldn’t be able to do it! But by using the
wooden drill in such a fashion, he’s able to easily drill straight
through it….” Thousands on thousands of scenes suddenly flashed
through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life on
Earth, there were some ordinary mortals who used electric power
drills to drill holes in walls. To ordinary mortals, concrete was
incredible hard and tough… and yet, a power drill was able to
easily pierce through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thought back to
the time he had spent wandering the Three Realms, where he had seen
ordinary mortals battling in close combat, using their fists to punch
out like Flood Dragons suddenly bursting forth from the waves… or
perhaps cultivators who used the spear…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I always thought…
that the Blood Drop stance should be the fastest stance I have. If
you want to be fast, you should take the shortest route and move as
quickly as you can.” Sword-arts were flickering through Ning’s
eyes. “Perhaps I was wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continuously
mentally mapped out one sword-art after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one reached Ning’s
level of sword-arts, what one truly needed was inspiration. A single
inspiration could allow his many years of accumulated insights to
suddenly burst forth and be transformed! During his past life on
Earth, there had been a scientist who saw an apple fall to the
ground. As a result, he was suddenly inspired and came up with the
law of universal gravitation. And yet, ordinary people might see the
same thing happen a billion times without coming up with this idea.
The reason why this scientist could was because he had a deep
background and numerous past insights. All he needed was that spark
of inspiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning needed a spark as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason he had been
able to come up with his Yin-Yang Sword Domain was similarly because
he had a moment of epiphany, allowing him to understand where his
future direction lay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the estate-world
which Ning carried on him at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji, World God
Pillsaint, Elder God Wilddog, and the others were all present here,
as were the World God servants who had been captured in the Bluegrace
Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji
had been meditating by the seashore, but she suddenly saw the
white-robed Ji Ning appear off in the distance. This was a divine
power incarnation which Ning had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strike.” Ning
stabbed outwards with his sword. Boom! Sword-light flashed and a few
cracks could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!” Ning
stabbed out once more. This time, his sword-light actually became a
spinning, draconic votex. Roaaaar! The stabbing sound caused the
space around him to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out
repeatedly with his sword, using actual practice to verify the many
ideas he had come up with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, there were
many different paths to train in the sword, and every single path
could theoretically lead to incredibly profound heights! In the past,
although Ning had been able to see sword-arts which were similar to
the ones he theorized about, he had never paid much attention to
them. Those were sword-arts which belonged to others! Now, however,
he had accumulated enough experience that he was able to naturally
advance to this new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only one’s own
sword-arts would allow one to have deeper levels of insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For one who trained in
the sword, only those sword-arts you yourself created would allow you
to reach the greatest heights of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are Master’s
sword-art changing repeatedly? But these sword-arts are all so
powerful.” Su Youji watched in a spellbound fashion. She was truly
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on this
island, including Elder God Wilddog and World God Pillsaint, were all
drawn to and intrigued by the sight of Ning training with the sword.
They all came over to watch, and all of them were stunned by what
they saw. These were all techniques which Ning had mentally
visualized and theorized. Although he felt they were ‘failures’,
every single one of these sword-arts was enough to allow a cultivator
to become a truly, freakishly powerful Daolord. Most likely, if you
used one of those sword-arts to become a Daolord you would instantly
be a match for peak Daolords of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… this wasn’t
what Ning wanted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
him, absorbed in his own sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One sword stabbed out
after another. Slowly, his sword-arts became to transform, becoming
very silent. Only in the final instant would they roar forth with an
explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword-light
stabbed out, there was no sound. Only when it came to a halt did it
release that odd explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those strange
explosions were growing louder and louder. They started to sound like
thunder, and anyone within tens of thousands of kilometers would
probably be able to hear them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out once
again. This stab was as silent as the others, but in that final
instant, there was just an extremely odd and extremely soft sound.
The sound was incredibly soft and subdued, but it filled the hearts
of everyone present with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Such a tiny
sound. When Ning’s sword stabbed forwards, a pitch-black hole
suddenly appeared in the space in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forwards,
walking into that pitch-black hole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that hole, there
was a gleaming, rainbow-like tunnel. Ning could sense that this
tunnel was leading him to many other places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A spatial
passageway?” Ning advanced forwards through the spatial passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Ning
stabbed out with his sword, and another hole suddenly appeared in the
rainbow light next to him. Ning stepped into this new hole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning emerged, he
realized that he was now in a desert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though I
went around the estate-world quite a few times in the blink of an
eye,” Ning chuckled. “I didn’t expect that I would be able to
use the Dao of the Sword to break through the bonds of space and
enter a different spatial dimension.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space was divided up
into many different dimensions. Prince Greatjoy had reached an
extremely high level of skill in the Dao of Spacetime, which was why
he could bring Ning and the others along with him when teleporting
through spacetime. This sort of escaping ability was incredibly
formidable! Ning himself was at most able to engage in spatial
teleportation, which was nothing more than teleporting to a different
place within the same spatial dimension. His sword, however, was able
to shatter through the spatial laws of a small area around it,
allowing one to pass through into a different spatial dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words, through
his Dao of the Sword Ning was now able to damage the Dao of Space and
force his way into a different spatial dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends… any Dao, when trained to the ultimate apex, allows for
mastery over all things,” Ning murmured softly. “At this point in
time, my Dao of the Sword has reached a level where I can enter a
different spatial dimension.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stance… has
finally been completed.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-stance
allowed him to forcibly destroy the Dao of Space in a localized
region. Being able to enter a different dimension? That was nothing
more than a side effect. In the end, the power of this stance was
what truly mattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really have to
thank that ‘Green Bamboo’ kid.” Ning revealed a smile. “I
just changed my way of thinking slightly and was able to finally
finish my path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning stood there
in the desert, sending out yet another stabbing strike. In the
instant in which his stab came to a halt, the sword-light around
Ning’s sword twisted just slightly. This twisting represented the
true, marvelous nature of the new Blood Drop stance! The reason why a
wooden drill was able to drill through a wooden board was because it
had to pass through the resistance of the wood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, it had to
pass through the resistance of the air itself. Even in the emptiness
of the space, there were forms of energy that would pose a degree of
resistance, and even in true emptiness of the void, there would be
the ripples of energy that came from the various prime essences of
the universe, such as the prime essence of the sword, the prime
essence of metal, the prime essence of wood, or the prime essence of
space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single place was
filled with traces of the Dao. All of them served as barriers or
forms of resistance that laid countless invisible strands around you.
So long as any trace of the Dao existed in a place, Ning’s sword
would have to go through those layers of resistance. There was no way
it could ever reach an infinitely fast speed! Thus, Ning’s current
stance was a stance of destruction, of piercing through anything
which sought to bar his path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword was like that
wooden drill which forcibly drilled through that wooden board.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning’s
stance even had the effect of destroying the Dao itself! It was
capable of destroying the Dao of Space, allowing him to enter a
separate spatial dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When my sword
strikes out, nothing can bar its path. After I am able to strengthen
it so that nothing can stop it, not the Five Elements, Yin and Yang,
or even spacetime… then that is when this stance of mine should be
comparable to the strongest stance which Emperor Mirrorsnow left
behind.” Ning still remembered the image of his master, Emperor
Mirrorsnow, displaying the most powerful stance of the [Heartseal]
sword-art. That, too, was a strike that completely surpassed the
limits of space and time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow had
relied on that stance to gain eternity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The faster you rush,
the slower you go. In the past, all I wanted to do was strike faster
and faster… but that isn’t real speed.” Many thoughts flickered
through Ning’s mind. “Many cultivators and many mortals try to
seize every moment of every day, but they still end up failing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sometimes, if you
slow down and catch your breath, then explode with full power, you
might be more successful. The Dao can be found in life itself. It can
be found in all things.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In comprehending the
Dao, one had to fully understand life in all its myriad forms, to
understand the essence of all things. If you did so, then when the
moment came you would be able to see through to the true nature of
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-stance Ning
had created destroyed all other Daos that barred its path. It seemed
slow, but in reality it was now faster than ever before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Blood Drop stance
is the fastest of all swords, a sword of destruction, a sword that
annihilates all other Daos. It is a stance that seeks to raise the
sword to the ultimate level.” Ning nodded slowly. “Now, of the
five stances of [Brightmoon], my Yin-Yang sword-intent and my Blood
Drop sword-intent have taken form.”

Chapter 5 – Ji Ning’s Second Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountainous
forest. That gray-templed youth continued to work on his simple
tools, while Ji Ning continued to stare at him while holding his fish
bucket in one hand and his fishing rod in the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How odd. He looks
like a youth, but he speaks in such a grandiose manner. I’m just
here working on some furniture for myself, and he’s been staring at
me for more than an hour,” the young man muttered to himself.
“Still… from the looks of him, he probably isn’t an ordinary
mortal. How could an ordinary mortal youth be fishing by himself in
the deep mountains? His demeanor seems quite extraordinary as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just continued to
stare, and the young man didn’t say anything about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning let out
a laugh as the sword-light in his eyes completely faded away. In
truth, no ordinary mortal would even be able to see the sword-light
generated from the visualizations he had just performed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just came here out
of curiosity on my way home from fishing… who would’ve thought
that I would’ve mastered yet another stance of [Brightmoon] as a
result?” Ning laughed and shook his head, his gaze still focused on
the young man. “Although he doesn’t realize it… that drilling
he did earlier helped inspire me to master this stance. I have to
repay him for that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already taken
a liking to the man due to his extraordinary heart. Now that the
young man had also helped him comprehend the Dao, Ning decided to
bless him with some transformative luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, I’ll take a
look at his history and see what he experienced. Only then will I
know what he truly needs.” Ning’s gaze rested on the young man’s
figure as he began to visualize all of the young man’s past
experiences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he wanted to
thank and reward this young mortal, he had to first know what the man
wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After seeing the man’s
history, Ning couldn’t help but shake his head. This young man’s
true name was Yang Quding, and he came from an excellent family
background. His mother had died when he was young, resulting in his
father doting on him. Ever since he was young, he had been covered in
brocade cloth and jade treasures. He was the son of a rich merchant,
after all. He was born with great cleverness, and his father had once
wanted to come up with a way for him to become an Immortal
cultivator. Alas, Yang Quding didn’t have a so-called ‘spiritual
root’. Ning, however, knew that the so-called ‘spiritual root’
was actually linked to one’s affinity for the natural energy of
Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The greater an affinity
you had for that natural energy, the easier it would be for you to
absorb it. Ever since Ning was young, for example, he always had a
close affinity for water. But of course, after he trained in the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] his body gained a high affinity towards
lightning. Alas, Yang Quding had absolutely terrible elemental
affinity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you were only able
to absorb 1% of how much others could absorb, it would naturally be
far more difficult for you to engage in cultivation. Even worse, this
continent possessed very sparse elemental energy to begin with,
making cultivation difficult for all. For someone in a place like
this to absorb elemental energy at such a ridiculously low rate…
the chances of becoming a successful cultivator were incredibly poor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
allowing his son to become an Immortal cultivator, Yang Quding’s
father had paid an enormous price. In the end, he had perished while
escorting a shipment of valuables. This had been a tremendous blow to
Yang Quding. After failing to become an Immortal cultivator, Yang
Quding focused all of his efforts on continuing his father’s legacy
as a merchant. He was quite clever and capable, and in just a few
short years he had become a huge tycoon. In fact, he even employed
two Foundation cultivators as well as several weaker Qi Condensation
cultivators. He eventually married a woman as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But then… one day, a
young, evil man entered the city which Yang Quding was in. He took a
fancy to Yang Quding’s wife, and desired to kidnap her and make her
his concubine. However, Yang Quding wasn’t an easy person to deal
with; he had Foundation cultivators by his side, and he was able to
bring a stop to this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem was that
this evil man had an extraordinary background. When Yang Quding
looked into this man’s background, he immediately befriended a Core
Formation elder of a major sect, giving him many precious treasures
and eventually becoming that Core Formation elder’s adopted son.
But of course, this was only in name! What really mattered was that
with this protector of a ‘father’, his opponent wouldn’t dare
to be too rash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, that evil man
played some tricks in secret, forcing Yang Quding’s wife’s family
to bow their heads before him. In the end, even Yang Quding’s wife
had chosen to follow the evil man and leave him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents had died
long ago. Yang Quding had no family of his own, and so his love for
his wife was deep and intense. And yet… his wife had actually
betrayed him and left to follow another man. When she left, she had
said, “Quding, you are able to protect me, but can you protect my
mother and father? Don’t blame me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had suffered a
severe mental blow, but he had no desire to take revenge. Instead, he
had just sat there dully every day. Eventually, he dispersed his
family’s savings and entered this mountainous forest, giving
himself the name ‘Green Bamboo’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, let me take a
look at his future.” Ning’s gaze was still affixed upon Yang
Quding’s figure. Yang Quding’s future was a bit cloudy; as soon
as he had met Ning, it was guaranteed that his destiny would change.
Ning was strong enough to annihilate this entire continent with ease,
after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning chose not to
interfere with his life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yang Quding would stay
by himself within this mountain forest for more than sixty years.
After sixty-plus years, he would encounter a Nascent Soul cultivator
of the Nirvana Sect. The two would chat together, resulting in the
Nascent Soul cultivator feeling tremendous admiration towards Yang
Quding. The Nascent Soul cultivator would pay an enormous price to
help him to become an Immortal cultivator. Alas, due to his great age
and his poor spiritual root, he was still only able to become a
Foundation cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had reached
an extremely high level of enlightenment. As a Foundation cultivator,
he was capable of slaying Core Formation Daoists. He was also a good
man with a virtuous reputation, and he was incredibly skilled in the
‘Illusions of Nirvana’, a skill which allowed him to trap foes in
myriad illusions which would cause them to feel regret, then repent
and change their ways. He even ended up slaying that vile man who had
taken his wife from him. Although he was merely a Foundation
cultivator, he was respectfully addressed as ‘Daoist Green Bamboo’
by others. In the end, due to his allotted time being used up, he
passed away peacefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His heart has
already reached such a profound level that he is even more formidable
than Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators in this
regard. After he becomes an Immortal cultivator… that ‘Illusions
of Nirvana’ technique is a classic example of something which major
powers who belong to the Buddhist paths would use.” Ning nodded
slowly. “Given his heart, he truly is well-suited to become an
Immortal cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of
sword-light suddenly shot out from Ning’s eyes, and they landed
upon the body of the furniture-making man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light quickly
covered his entire body, rapidly transforming and overhauling it. The
young man’s body quickly began to completely transform, with his
muscles and tendons reaching a level of perfection in strength. His
physical strength alone was stronger than even Xiantian-level
Fiendgods of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a body like this…
it could be said that Yang Quding’s spiritual result was
unquestionably number one in this entire continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved a
finger, tapping Yang Quding on the forehead. A surge of divine will
surged outwards and was transmitted straight into his sea of
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yang Quding was just an
ordinary mortal, after all. Even though his body had been completely
transformed, he still couldn’t withstand the power of the memories
which Ning wished to give him. Thus, Ning could only choose to leave
a stream of his own divine will within Yang Quding’s mind, much
like how Emperor Mirrorsnow had left some of his own divine will
behind. However, the reason why Emperor Mirrorsnow had done this was
because he had left long ago and wished to be able to pass something
onto his disciples. Ning had done this because his disciple was too
weak and wouldn’t be able to endure a ‘normal’ transmission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, you are
too weak. You are only able to endure me passing unto you sword-arts
and techniques which are at the Empyrean God or Celestial Immortal
level,” Ning mused to himself. That stream of divine will contained
complete cultivation systems, including both of Ning’s proudest
accomplishments, the ‘Yin-Yang’ sword-art and the ‘Blood Drop’
sword-art. These were Ning’s most impressive techniques to date.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the young man grew
stronger, he would naturally gain more and more information from this
legacy. When his soul became sufficiently powerful, he would finally
be able to endure and receive it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the first
person I’ve truly transmitted my sword-arts unto.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s first disciple
was Bluecliff Xiaoyu, but that was because of the rules of Mount
Innerheart. Ning had to choose a person of great karmic virtue as his
disciple! His Primaltwin stood guard over the Three Realms and would
often provide Bluecliff Xiaoyu with some advice, but alas she simply
wasn’t that talented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Green Bamboo’,
also known as Yang Quding, was Ning’s second disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only left behind a
cultivation method and his sword-arts! As for divine abilities and
what not, he didn’t leave any of those. Emperor Mirrorsnow had left
behind four Daolord-level golems, but Ning didn’t leave a single
protective measure behind at all. This was because these fairly
weaker protective measures wouldn’t really be that useful. Given
Green Bamboo’s talent, it wouldn’t be hard for him to rise to
prominence in this Mortal Realm. As for those excessively powerful
protective measures? They might actually result in some unnecessary
trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guiding and nurturing a
mortal was completely different from guiding and nurturing a
World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow
required his potential disciples to be World-level cultivators who
had passed multiple trials. Yang Quding, however, was still just an
ordinary mortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what did I just…”
Yang Quding felt as though he had just awoken from a dream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he came to his
senses, he saw a youth carrying a fishing bucket and a fishing rod
walk far off into the distance. “Disciple, if fate wills it the two
of us shall meet again, ahahah…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And just like that,
Ning vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yang Quding was
stunned. Moments later, a large amount of information flooded into
his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were detailed
instructions on how to go from being an ordinary mortal to a
Celestial Immortal or Empyrean God. There were also two inconceivably
powerful sword-arts known as the [Yin-Yang] sword-arts and the [Blood
Drop] sword-arts. Only part of the information was available to him
for now. When his soul grew stronger, he’d naturally be able to
gain even more of this legacy. Ning had set down restrictive spells
on his memories, preventing him from teaching these things to any
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but…” Yang
Quding was stunned. He wasn’t someone who knew nothing of
cultivation at all. He knew what the major impediments to Immortal
cultivation were, but today he had just gained techniques which would
actually lead him past tribulation and reach the legendary level of
Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods? And this was just a portion of
the true technique? And those infinitely powerful sword-arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yang Quding instantly
understood that from this day forth, his life would be changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a major power was to
scry his destiny, he would discover that this man’s life had been
completely changed. His future would actually become extremely fuzzy,
and the farther one gazed the more difficult it would be to divine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Yang
Quding immediately knelt down and kowtowed towards the direction in
which Ning left. He remembered that Ning had addressed himself as
Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s in an
alternate universe, while I must return to the Endless Territories. I
wonder if we’ll ever meet again,” Ning mused. He had been seized
by the sudden impulse to teach a disciple. He… really was an
absolutely irresponsible ‘master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Prince
Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, Waterlord Firesurge, and Skyfire
Brightshore were seated next to each other, drinking some wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just caught a big
fish.” Ning grinned as he lifted up his fish bucket.

Chapter 6 – Sacred Immortal Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Prince
Greatjoy, Solewind, and the others lived a life of leisure here at
Wintermount. Although they were ten billion kilometers away, their
gazes were still often turned towards what was happening at the
spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This disciple of
mine actually has some talent for the sword after all.” Ning paid
quite a bit of attention to his disciple. Although Yang Quding lived
on Wintermount as well, nobody here was able to detect Ning’s
presence unless he wished it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
this kid’s sword-arts seem quite similar to your own Yin-Yang Sword
Domain.” Prince Greatjoy sat nearby, watching as Yang Quding
trained in swordplay ten kilometers away. “He trains by himself
within the deep mountains, neither impatient nor hasty, and his heart
is as calm as water. I have to say, his heart is quite impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can be considered
my disciple,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple?” Prince
Greatjoy was shocked. “You accepted an ordinary mortal as a
disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had a good
impression of Yang Quding, the man was still nothing more than an
ordinary mortal. The five of them were amongst the most truly,
freakishly talented figures of the entire Endless Territories. Even
Skyfire Brightshore, who was currently still the weakest of the five,
was a dazzling genius of the Brightshore Imperials. As for the other
four, they all wielded their own Supreme Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any of them could break
through into the Daolord level at any moment, and they would be
extraordinary ones at that. Given Ning’s status… if he wanted to
choose a disciple, virtually all World-level cultivators would be
crying and begging for a chance to be chosen. And yet, he instead
chose an ordinary mortal as his disciple?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple?”
The nearby Solewind laughed. “We’re just passing through this
place. Why’d you accept a disciple? And is this how you treat your
disciples? You just completely ignore them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I wanted to
mentor him, I wouldn’t be able to do so for long. Better to just
let him grow naturally.” Ning took a slow sip of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth
certainly takes it easy,” Waterlord Firesurge said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than sixty-one years went past. The spacetime transfer array was
almost ready once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
Greatjoy rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to head out,
Darknorth. Stop staring at your disciple,” Solewind teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just glanced
off into the distance. His second disciple, ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang
Quding, had long ago departed from Wintermount and was out
adventuring through the world. He was already quite famous for
millions of kilometers around, and was venerated as ‘Sword Immortal
Green Bamboo’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once he left, the two
of them truly would have parted from each other. Once Ning returned
to the Endless Territories, the two would be located within two
separate universes. It truly was hard to say if they would ever meet
again. It would all be up to fate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the core of
the spacetime transfer array was quite large, it was still completely
packed with hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and
Apotheosis cultivators who had gathered here throughout this utterly
massive continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists, the
ancient transfer array shall only be activated once every hundred
years.” A middle-ranked Apotheosis cultivator was standing in
midair and speaking in a sonorous voice. “Our Mortal Realm is
unfathomably vast and filled with countless cultivators. Thus, I
would like to invite all fellow Daoists interested in going to the
Sacred Immortal Realm to first enter this estate-world! This
estate-world is a very simple and crude one which is quite weak; any
Apotheosis cultivator can easily tear it apart from within. All of us
will enter this estate-world, and then the ancient transfer array
will teleport it to the other side. This will be much easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Makes sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This has been the
standard method for many years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Nascent Soul
cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators nodded in agreement. This was
a custom that had been established many years ago. Otherwise, how was
the array supposed to be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of
cultivators? The estate-treasure before them was quite crude and
simple. They were able to see through it to know what was going on
outside, and were also able to tear through it at a moment’s
notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning’s group
of five, they were mixed into the enormous group of cultivators. No
one paid them any heed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists, let
us go inside together.” The tall middle-aged man in midair was the
first to fly towards the entrance of the estate-world which was
placed at the very center of the ancient transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This estate-world was
shaped like an actual Immortal estate, and it had a normal ‘gate’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless streaks of
light flew towards the entrance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ning’s group of five followed the crowd into the estate as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is weak.”
The five found a corner within the estate-world, and no other
cultivators were able to notice their presence. Ning laughed as he
sent mentally, “I feel like the slightest vibration would be enough
to cause it to completely collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me stabilize it
a bit. I actually am worried about it splintering,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cultivator on the
outside had just activated the spacetime transfer array. Because it
had already stored up enough energy, it now was able to completely
activate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundreds of
millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators
gathered inside were all incredibly excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sacred Immortal
Realm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re finally
going to arrive at the Sacred Immortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the elders of my
school are in the Sacred Immortal Realm. According to the legends,
there are far more cultivators in the Sacred Immortal Realm than
there are in our world.” They were all incredibly excited by this.
Ever since they had embarked upon the path of cultivation, they had
dreamed of one day reaching the apex of power in the Mortal Realm and
then heading to the Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those qualified to head
into the Sacred Immortal Realm were all major figures of the Mortal
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the teleportation effect came to an end. The estate-world had been
sent to the Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s group had
been relaxing in their little corner. Now, all of their faces
tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s
wrong.” Prince Greatjoy sent mentally, “Everyone, let us hide
ourselves for now and watch what happens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This feeble
estate-world had virtually no impact on them at all. They were able
to see through it to the outside world and knew what was happening
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve arrived at
the Sacred Immortal Realm.” The hundreds of millions of Nascent
Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators were all incredibly
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shoddily-made
estate-treasure blew apart with a boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Nascent
Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators all suddenly appeared in
midair, covering the skies and blocking out the sun like a horde of
locusts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such dense elemental
energy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The elemental energy
here is far denser than it is in our Mortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
Sacred Immortal Realm?” The countless cultivators all stared
excitedly… but suddenly, they saw a large number of stone pillars
off in the distance. The stone pillars all had cultivators bound to
them. Some were humanoid, some were monsters, and some were beasts.
Although they looked different, all of them were covered with blood,
wounds, and scars. Many of them had eyes filled with furious hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deathly silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundreds of
millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators who
had just arrived were all deathly silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those cultivators bound
to the stone pillars had clearly suffered countless types of torture.
What was going on?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another batch has
arrived.” One of the many bound and tormented cultivators let out a
low mutter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One batch after
another. There’s never an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who can send a
message to the people of the Mortal Realm? Tell them not to come to
this ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’. Do not come!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly shouldn’t
have come here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I regret it so
much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t come to the
Sacred Immortal Realm.” The countless bound cultivators all mumbled
and moaned in broken, pained voices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the hundreds of
millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators who
had just arrived, they all knew that something was wrong. Their
hearts were as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!”
Suddenly, the vast land began to tremble as a deep laugh rang out
from the depths of the earth. Slowly, one mountain-like figure after
another began to emerge from underground. There was over a hundred of
these figures, and each one was thirty thousand meters tall. An aura
of darkness spread out to cover the skies as they stared at the
countless cultivators with their blood-red eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred towering
figures, and every single one of them possessed an aura that caused
the cultivators to quiver in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?!” A
golden-robed man amidst the crowd tamped down his horror enough to
say, “This isn’t the Sacred Immortal Rea-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Sacred
Immortal Realm.” One of the towering forms spoke out in a
thundering voice that shook Heaven and Earth. As he waved his hand,
he caused an enormous cloth sack to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cloth sack gave
birth to an utterly, incredibly powerful sucking force. The hundreds
of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators
tried to resist, but they were still forcibly sucked into the cloth
sack. After all the cultivators were sucked away, the cloth sack
shrank in size and flew back into the towering figure’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few more toys.”
The towering figure looked at the cloth sack, then let out a low
laugh. “Master shall be excited by this! I will go deliver him his
toys. As for the rest of you, stay here and deal with the disobedient
ones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
other towering figures all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bag-holding figure
quickly flew off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
was standing there in midair. Given Prince Greatjoy’s mastery over
spacetime, the towering figures were completely unable to see them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group just
watched silently as this all happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred Elder
God-level golems.” Ning narrowed his eyes as he sent mentally, “And
they spoke of a ‘master’. His master is most likely a Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. This ‘Sacred
Immortal Realm’ most likely has a Daolord standing behind it.”
Solewind had a solemn look on his face as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be
trouble. Let’s be careful as we investigate this matter,” Prince
Greatjoy said somberly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them left
the area silently.

Chapter 7 – The Enormous Prison
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Book 28, Archaeus
Region, Chapter 7 – The Enormous Prison
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
didn’t dare to cause the slightest disturbance, for fear of drawing
the attention of the ‘Daolord’ they suspected of being behind
this Sacred Immortal Realm. Right now, they had the advantage of
stealth. Once they were discovered, things would become difficult.
This Sacred Immortal Realm was someone else’s territory, after all.
There had to be many formations protecting it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, that local
branch of the Bluegrass Sect in the Brightshore Kingdom was only
staffed with weak World-level cultivators, but they were still able
to trap Ning thanks to the grand protective formation! A Daolord’s
lair was an incredibly dangerous place. There was no such thing as
being too careful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ning’s
group was fairly confident. Generally speaking, they wouldn’t be
worried about weaker Daolords at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
silently teleported through space to move to the margins of this
great continent, the Sacred Immortal Realm. Given Prince Greatjoy’s
mastery over spacetime, a spatial teleportation caused no spatial
ripples at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
group stood next to some boulders at the rather ragged edges of this
continent. When they looked at the chaotic space up in front of them,
they saw countless streaks of golden runes flickering and flashing.
An enormous, ethereal formation was covering this entire continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
formation,” Heartlord Solewind said softly. “This formation is so
profound that even I find it difficult to fathom. There’s no way an
ordinary Daolord was capable of creating it. I wonder if this
formation was purchased by this Daolord or if he created it himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully, he bought
it.” Prince Greatjoy looked as solemn as the others had ever seen
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone capable of
developing this formation was a Daolord of the Third Step, at the
very least. In fact, it might even be a Verge-level Daolord of the
Fourth Step! Given this Daolord also had the advantage of being on
familiar terrain… they were going to be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then how should we
leave this place?” Waterlord Firesurge asked, “You all saw that
spatial transfer array. It’ll only allow us to return to the Mortal
Realm! Once we activate it to go back to the Mortal Realm, that
Daolord will definitely find out and might chase us all the way back.
We’ll have nowhere to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Return to the Mortal
Realm through the formation?” Prince Greatjoy shook his head.
“Those golems would probably notice as soon as we did anything,
which means their master would know as well. Given how powerful
Daolords are, this one would probably be able to send his will to
span the entire Sacred Immortal Realm in an instant! He would be able
to disrupt the transference process. We probably won’t have any
chance of going back to the Mortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Solewind,
Skyfire, and Firesurge all had heavy looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daolord definitely
was an opponent who could prove to be a huge threat to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re not going to
be able to defeat this formation.” Solewind raised his head to
glance at the great formation covering the entire Sacred Immortal
Realm. “Even if we go back to the Mortal Realm, it won’t be of
any use. Once we go back, we won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep
looking,” Ning advised. “Perhaps we might find something useful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them began
to stealthily search the entire Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sacred Immortal
Realm was much smaller than the Mortal Realm, covering just a few
tens of billions of kilometers! The entire continent was covered by
this enormous formation, and in the very center of the continent
there was a dim, faint green mist. Deep within that mist, there was a
towering estate that could vaguely be seen. This was the only place
in the entire continent which Ning’s group did not dare to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was highly likely
that this estate was the place where the Daolord lived!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
aura of resentment and hatred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
standing atop a barren, black land as they stared towards the
enormous black edifice off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above that enormous
black edifice was an aura of hatred which was so strong that it had
actually become corporeal. Some of the hatred was tinged with red
light, while others glowed with a black aura. However, the hatred
located at the highest parts of the edifice were transformed into a
deep green color, a deep green which was formed as a result of the
condensed hatred of countless cultivators over the course of
countless years. Every so often, furious faces could be seen
appearing within the aura of hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I destroyed
a hundred chaosworld, the hatred and resentment wouldn’t be as
strong as it is here.” Greatjoy frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that
there are countless cultivators imprisoned within. This aura of
hatred should be generated by them,” Solewind said. “The reason
why it is so dense is possibly because these cultivators are
suffering unspeakable torments. We saw early on how many cultivators
were lashed to those stone pillars.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go inside,”
Skyfire Brightshore urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They needed more
information. None of them dared to be arrogant in dealing with the
Daolord that might be living in seclusion within this continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous black
edifice was a jail of utterly titanic proportions, and countless
cultivators were imprisoned within it. It must be understood that the
Mortal Realm’s formation would activate once every century. It was
only natural that many cultivators had been imprisoned here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place…”
Waterlord Firesurge’s face paled as he continued to walk forwards.
“This place is even more terrifying than the terrible Nightmare
Lands which the legends of my homeland spoke of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And more terrifying
than the Eighteen Hells of my own homeland.” Ning was equally
somber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous prison
was filled with various implements of torture and punishment. This
entire prison was in reality designed strictly for the torture of
cultivators. It must be understood that the Eighteen Hells of the
Three Realms were designed to punish great sinners, but this place
had only one purpose… to torture and torment as much as possible.
This made it a thousand times as frightening, causing even the faces
of these five to turn pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHH! All of you
will die one day! You demons! You devils! All of you will DIE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nooooo…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me! Spare me!
Spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No begging. Begging
is pointless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of voices
could be heard. Some were filled with hatred, some rambled, some were
frenzied, some were screaming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire prison was
being used to furiously torment all of the hundreds of millions of
newly imprisoned Nascent Soul and Apotheosis cultivators. Some of the
new abductees were still begging for mercy, but they soon realized
that this was completely pointless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
continued their journey through the prison. Nobody was able to see
them, not even the golems responsible for torturing the prisoners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of these golems
were at least at the Elder God level. Some were at the True God
level, and a few were even at the Empyrean God level. There had to be
millions of golems within this prison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who would’ve
thought that the ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’ so many dreamed of was
actually a hell such as this?” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed. However,
there are very few Elder God-level golems. Most are weaker… perhaps
the Daolord of this land is fairly weak as well,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully.” A
murderous look was in Greatjoy’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Daolord was a
weak one, the five of them would join forces to kill him! That would
end all their worries at one go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
restrictive formations scattered throughout the prison, they were
meant for weaker cultivators and were completely ineffective against
Ning’s group. Ning’s group was able to easily enter one of the
jail cells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This jail cell held
over a hundred cultivators, all shackled in chains. One of them was a
skinny old man who was seated silently in the lotus position, a
terrifying look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t accept
this. I can’t accept this!” The skinny old man growled mentally,
“I have to ascend and escape. If I can escape, in the future I’ll
come back and kill these devils.” To this very day, he had yet to
realize that his tormentors were actually golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The skinny
old man suddenly felt that something was off. Five figures had
suddenly appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-…” The old
man was stunned. This was absolutely bizarre. These five figures were
simply too clean and pristine, and none of them were wearing
shackles. What’s more… the doors to the prison hadn’t even
opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some
questions for you,” the skinny, bald, red-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the skinny
old man said obediently. He felt a sense of absolute devotion to the
man before him. If the man ordered him to commit suicide, he wouldn’t
hesitate in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for other manacled
cultivators in the jail cell, they weren’t able to see a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s group
infiltrated the enormous prison, a figure suddenly flew out of an
ancient, towering estate which was surrounded by faint green mist
that was located in the very core of the Sacred Immortal Realm. This
figure was dressed in light green robes, had a stooped form, and just
a few green scales on his forehead. His eyes looked quite cold and
insidious, and his ancient face was covered in wrinkles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” An Elder
God golem standing outside the estate, waiting respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The stooped
old man nodded. “The new batch of cultivators have arrived?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they just
arrived. We’ve already sent them all into the prison,” the Elder
God golem said respectfully. Golems were a type of magic treasures,
but when they gained sentience they would be just as intelligent as
actually living beings. The difference was, they would be
unswervingly loyal and would do whatever their master ordered them to
do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Let’s go take
a look.” The stooped figure nodded slowly. The Elder God golem
followed behind him respectfully, and the two quickly flew into the
skies. In the blink of an eye, they moved more than ten billion
kilometers and arrived at the enormous prison, wreathed in an aura of
baleful energy.

Region, Chapter 8 – The Hope of the Cultivators
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous prison was
divided into many different regions. Within a jail cell located in
one particular corner of the prison, Ji Ning’s group of five was
staring at that skinny, elderly prisoner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was captured and
brought to this place six hundred years ago, after I travelled
through the spacetime transfer array and arrived at the Sacred
Immortal Realm.” The skinny old man’s eyes were filled with a
reminiscent look as he said softly, “Ever since then, I’ve been
imprisoned here. I’ve suffered countless torments. Some cultivators
chose to self-detonate because they were unable to endure the misery.
Ugh… I really wish I could go back to the Mortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group all
frowned. Solewind asked, “Do you know nothing about the rest of
this Sacred Immortal Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny old man
shook his head. “I know very little. We’ve been trapped here this
entire time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know about
the ‘master’ which these devils who torture you serve?”
Solewind asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny man trembled
as a look of terror appeared in his eyes. “He… he’s the master
of the devils. He’s terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. After I was
imprisoned here, I saw him visit the prison on two separate
occasions. He used a terrifying spell to personally torture us.
Countless cultivators were simultaneously tortured at the same time.
He was simply too powerful, too terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twice? He visited
the prison twice in the past six hundred years?” Solewind’s face
tightened slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He comes quite
frequently,” Prince Greatjoy growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to be
careful. Who knows when this Daolord will appear again?” Ning said
solemnly. He didn’t dare to spread out his own godsense, as once he
did that it would be very easy for their foe to detect them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy
suddenly frowned. “I ask you this. The ancient transfer array
activates once every century, which means that an utter flood of
cultivators has been sent over here over the course of many years. If
the torment never comes to an end… why are so many of you still
alive? If you know that life will be worse than death, and that you
will be subject to perpetual agony with no way of fighting back, why
are you still enduring?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were intrigued. Right. When faced with overwhelming power,
overwhelming despair, and the prospect of never-ending torture, why
wouldn’t they choose to die? Logically speaking, most would rather
commit suicide than to continue like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because we are going
to get revenge,” the skinny old man growled, his eyes filled with
fury and hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You? How?” Prince
Greatjoy was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can ascend, we
can leave this place.” The skinny old man ground his teeth. “After
ascending, I will become a Celestial Immortal and will be able to
continue to cultivate. In the future, after I grow stronger, I’ll
definitely come back and get my revenge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
asked, “Ascend? If you ascend, you’ll be able to escape the
Sacred Immortal Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all puzzled. Logically speaking, ‘ascension’ should
represent ascending into an estate-world of a Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who ascend can
indeed escape,” the skinny old man said immediately. “Long, long
ago, before our Mortal Realm even had that ancient transfer array, it
was somewhat easier for cultivators to train to the late Apotheosis
stage. In the Mortal Realm, there were some who were occasionally
able to reach that stage, and once they did the Celestial Tribulation
would soon descend upon them. After the tribulation, they would
ascend to a land of Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, cultivation
in the Mortal Realm became more difficult. However, the ancient
transfer array then appeared, and some of our ancient predecessors
chose to travel through it and go to the Sacred Immortal Realm. Some
of them even came back and then told their descendants and juniors
that the Sacred Immortal Realm was a holy place for cultivation with
incredibly dense elemental energy. As a result, successive
generations of cultivators have come to this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only after entering
did we realize that it was all just a trick.” The skinny old man
gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other four
were all extraordinary figures. They immediately understood what had
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, before the
‘Mortal Realm’ was discovered by that Daolord, cultivation was a
much simpler path. When the enormous protective formation sprang up
to protect the continent from the spatial storms around it, it
naturally caused the elemental energy in the continent to grow
sparse, making cultivation much more difficult. The ancient transfer
array then appeared, followed by some cultivators who were
soul-compelled to return from this ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’ and
widely spread rumors of how wonderful it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was only natural
that more and more cultivators would be drawn to enter it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all a plot.
In truth, in the Mortal Realm it is still possible for outstandingly
talented geniuses to reach the late-stage Apotheosis level, then
successfully overcome their tribulations and ascend.” The skinny
elder continued, “But it truly is very, very difficult. The Mortal
Realm is unfathomably vast, but only a handful of people each century
can achieve their goals and ascend. That is why we all entered this
Sacred Immortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny elder shook
his hea.d “Although we are imprisoned here, it is still true that
elemental energy in this world is far denser than it was in ours. It
isn’t too hard to reach the late-stage of the Apotheosis level.
However, once those devils notice us reaching that stage, they’ll
immediately strike and kill us! Thus, we have to accumulate as much
power as possible. We need to build up so much power that as soon as
we reach the late-stage of the Apotheosis level, the Celestial
Tribulation will immediately descend. By then, those devils won’t
be able to do anything to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So as long as you
cause a Celestial Tribulation, you’ll be out of danger?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Celestial
Tribulation comes, they would never dare to interfere! All they would
do is stand off to one side and watch. Even if that devil lord came
himself, he would just watch from afar. Anyone who succeeds in the
tribulation would immediately ascend to the legendary Immortal
Lands,” the skinny elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and the others
questioned him, they continued to discuss this matter amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, in
places like the Three Realms the so-called ‘Celestial Tribulation’
might pose a threat to ordinary cultivators, but it definitely
wouldn’t be able threaten a World-level cultivator! A World-level
cultivator would be capable of annihilating the entire Three Realms;
how could a mere tribulation be able to do anything to him? By the
same principle, it was impossible for a Celestial Tribulation to
threaten a Daolord! Even if a Celestial Tribulation did descend, a
Daolord could forcibly intervene and completely destroy the
tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a possible
answer,” Firesurge whispered. “Ever since we entered the Archaeus
region, we’ve been hearing stories of ‘ascension’ from the
continents that we visit. Do you think it’s possible that there’s
a Daolord in every single continent? That they will all go so far as
to spend time and effort setting up an estate-world to protect them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you
saying?” Solewind looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you’ve
all noticed this by now as well. After we entered the Archaeus
region, we’ve been able to sense that its power permeates every
inch of this region,” Firesurge said. “The only reason we aren’t
crushed by it is because we bear Archaeus medallions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded. It was true that the power of the Archaeus region was
omnipresent here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then… it is
entirely possible that the ‘Celestial Tribulation’ sent down upon
the countless living creatures of the many continents here were all
sent down by the Archaeus region itself,” Firesurge said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, that has to
be it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their eyes all
instantly lit up as they came to understand this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation… it only came about as a result of the natural laws of
Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a chaosworld such as
the Three Realms, the ‘laws’ in question were the laws of the
chaoworld itself, and thus it was the chaosworld itself which sent
down the Celestial Tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But here in the
Archaeus region, those vast continents did not have any natural laws
that belonged to the continents themselves. Logically speaking, there
was no way for the continents themselves to send down Celestial
Tribulations. Which meant… it had to be the entire Archaeus region
which sent down the tribulations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because the
tribulations are sent by the Archaeus region itself, not even
Daolords would dare to interfere. If they did, they would be punished
by the power of the entire Archaeus region,” Firesurge said. The
reason why someone like Ning would be able to destroy the Celestial
Tribulation of the Three Realms was because he wasn’t afraid of any
reprisal from the Three Realms. But a reprisal from the Archaeus
region… even Eternal Emperors would fear such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus region was
the very core of this entire alternate universe! A strike from it
would essentially represent a strike from the entire universe itself!
Who would dare to withstand such a blow?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes perfect
sense.” Skyfire Brightshore nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a high
probability that you are correct. I’d say the chances are at least
80%. But there’s another 20% probability as well… perhaps all
this talk of ‘ascension’ is nothing more than a cruel lie meant
to give these cultivators hope. Once they lose all hope, they
probably won’t be able to keep on living,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning and the
other four silently emerged from that small jail cell. They continued
to walk through the enormous prison, with no one able to detect them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GREETINGS, MASTER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, every inch of
the prison exploded with raucous chants. Every single one of the
million-plus golems obediently knelt down, and the sound of their
knees hitting the ground echoed throughout the prison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lord of the
devils is coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s come again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the prisoners
trapped within those countless jail cells within the prison heard the
noise, they instantly became filled with terror. Each time this ‘lord
of the devils’ arrived, he would bring them nightmarish torment
that was even worse than what the devils were able to dispense.
Everyone’s breathing became ragged and chaotic, and even the aura
of hatred, resentment, and madness which permeated the place became
much stronger than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
pale, as did that of the other four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
snort rang out, followed by an awe-inspiringly powerful surge of
heartforce that swept out and covered the entire prison. At the same
time, some faint green mist began to seep towards every single cell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly, the green
mist came to an immediate halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even that wave of
heartforce trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are the five of
you?!” A furious and stunned mental query rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
was standing there in the hallways. They were able to easily ensure
the golems were unable to detect them, but there was no way for them
to avoid the heartforce scan of a Daolord.

Chapter 9 – Slaying a Daolord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
four felt a bit frantic. All this was happening too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Heartlord
Solewind sent mentally, “We came on the command of our master to
enter the Archaeus region and test ourselves here. Alas, we
accidentally entered the Mortal Realm, then rode the spacetime
transfer array in preparing to depart from this place. We never
imagined that the Sacred Immortal Realm was a place which we could
not exit, and so we began to search for a way which would allow us to
leave this place. We have no intentions of being your enemy, senior.
I’d like to ask you to permit us to leave the Sacred Immortal
Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Five World-level
cultivators and five Archaeus medallions… such wealth!” The
stooped Daolord who stood at the entrance of the prison sent his
voice out echoing with the ears of the five. “Letting you leave
isn’t completely out of the question. However, you have to agree to
one of my conditions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pray tell, senior,”
Solewind immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without actually
fighting them, no one would be able to tell how strong Ning’s group
was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Archaeus region,
there were some Daolords who would slay any World-level cultivators
they saw and steal their Archaeus medallions. However, the majority
of Daolords were unwilling to lower themselves and rob juniors, nor
were they willing to offend the sect standing behind those
World-level cultivators. Generally speaking, World-level cultivators
within the Archaeus region all had significant backgrounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need you to swear
a lifeblood oath that once you leave this place, you will never let
anyone else learn a single thing about what you experienced in the
Mortal Realm and the Sacred Immortal Realm. If you accept, I’ll let
you leave this place,” the stooped Daolord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lifeblood oath?”
Solewind immediately smiled. “That’s simple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Prince
Greatjoy’s face tightened as light suddenly shot out of his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, the
faces of Solewind, Ji Ning, Skyfire Brightshore, and Firesurge all
changed. They, too, could sense a terrifying strong surge of power
descend from the heavens towards the prison. For this surge of power
to descend from the heavens was a clear size that it came from the
grand formation which protected the entire Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Firesurge
had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Prince
Greatjoy bellowed out the same word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
attacked simultaneously!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stooped Daolord was
at the entrance to the enormous prison, and his eyes were unspeakably
cold and grim. The skies above him suddenly lit up as the previously
ethereal-looking formation was activated, causing an enormous black
serpent to appear out of nowhere and descend from the heavens at
tremendous speeds as it shot towards the prison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, the stooped
Daolord had intentionally been wasting some time chatting with them
to buy himself enough time to unleash the power of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All those who
discover the existence of the Sacred Immortal Realm must perish.” A
murderous look was in the stooped Daolord’s eyes, and the enormous
serpent moved so quickly that it appeared before him in a flash.
However… immediately afterwards, the stooped Daolord’s face
turned pale. “WHAT?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His godsense was
showing him what those five World-level cultivators were doing… and
they were absolutely terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five, Ji Ning
and Heartlord Solewind were the fastest to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld,
descend!” Solewind’s red robes fluttered as he glared towards the
stooped Daolord coldly, and he showed no mercy at all when he
attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartworld
projection instantly descended upon this area, causing the entire
prison to boom violently. It was as though something incredibly heavy
had smashed down upon it, and it was smashed apart as easily as a
piece of tofu. This enormous prison was capable of holding countless
cultivators prisoner, but for people on Ning’s level it was
incredibly fragile. Previously, they had been deep within the prison
while the Daolord had been at the entrance, which meant they were
separated by many different gates. It was simpler to just destroy the
entire damn thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless cultivators
gawked in amazement at this scene. The jail cells they had been
trapped in were all crushed into tiny pieces, but they themselves
were left completely unscathed. This was a testament to how precise
and masterful Heartlord Solewind was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The million-plus golems
were all knocked flat onto the ground under the crushing pressure of
the heartworld projection. They weren’t able to resist in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Exalted
Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Grand Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens have
finally come to our aid!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless cultivators
stared at the red-robed Heartlord Solewind, who stood there like a
veritable god. Heartlord Solewind seemed to have become the center of
this entire world, and he stared at that distant, stooped Daolord as
he sent the full weight of his heartworld projection crashing
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Heartforce
Cultivator?” The stooped figure was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to Heartlord
Solewind was the white-robed Ji Ning, and his eyes were equally cold.
Rumble. A terrifying mixture of electric light and watery light
appeared around him. The seven types of Dao lightning and seven types
of Dao water transformed into a series of divine swords. The many
divine swords moved incredibly fast, quickly sweeping towards the
distant stooped Daolord and forming a terrifying domain that was like
a vortex of darkness which ground away at his form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the Yin-Yang
Sword Domain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sword cultivator?
How could he be as terrifying as this?!” The stooped Daolord was
now completely flabbergasted, and he hurriedly controlled his black
serpent and used it to protect himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black serpent
howled furiously as it struggled to ‘survive’. The surrounding
Yin-Yang Sword Domain was like a deadly fishing net that had been
tightly wrapped around the serpent’s form and furiously tearing
away at it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great Annihilation!”
Prince Greatjoy had a similarly icy look on his face as he
immediately unleashed his most powerful killer attack. His twin palms
suddenly glittered with dazzling golden light as they instantly
pierced through the skies, striking with invincible and deadly intent
towards the stooped Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! When the enormous
golden palms struck down upon the black serpent, the black serpent
tried to endure the power… but with a rumble, it began to shake and
then crack apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!” The
stooped Daolord let out a furious, terrified scream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore and
Waterlord Firesurge simultaneously struck out. The former struck out
with a blazing red tail while the latter sent out two enormous
entwined water dragons that shot out. The black serpent was already
at the brink of collapse due to Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Intent and
Prince Greatjoy’s attack. Now, it completely broke apart… and the
power of the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and the other attacks all
simultaneously thundered down upon the Daolord’s body. The Daolord
did have other treasures he could use to defend himself, but he was
completely unable to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was completely,
totally annihilated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
cultivators all just stared in a dazed fashion. That invincibly
powerful and utterly terrifying ‘lord of devils’, a man so strong
that he made their souls quiver when they looked at him… had been
instantly killed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really had been just
an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them had
only struck out a single time each! Ning had only made use of his
Yin-Yang Sword Domain; he wasn’t even given enough time to launch a
second attack before the Daolord had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We… we…” The
countless cultivators stared at Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind them.”
Heartlord Solewind swept the area with his gaze. His heartworld
projection had the appearance of an endless range of blazing
mountains. As for the million-plus golems that were being suppressed
by it, the death of their master had resulted in them instantly
becoming ownerless. Thus, Heartlord Solewind was able to bind them
all right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although these
golems are fairly low-level, there’s certainly a great deal of
them. Let’s split them up into five portions,” Heartlord Solewind
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four didn’t
really care that much and so just waved their hands to accept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord was
really quite weak. I felt as though he was merely an ordinary Daolord
of the First Step.” Prince Greatjoy shook his head. “If it wasn’t
for the formation itself being incredibly powerful, brother
Darknorth’s sword-intent domain alone probably would’ve wiped him
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded. This Daolord had been very weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning, Solewind,
and Greatjoy had attacked, their attacks had been blocked by the
black serpent. In the end, it had been the attacks of Skyfire
Brightshore and Firesurge which had caused the black serpent to
collapse! As for the Daolord himself? He wasn’t able to resist them
in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder… is there
perhaps a second Daolord here in the Sacred Immortal Realm?” Prince
Greatjoy was worried. “This one was far too weak, while the
formation itself was rather strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare
for there to be a Daolord assigned to watch guard over a continent.
Do you really think there would be a second one?” Solewind shook
his head. “As for the power of the formation… perhaps this
Daolord purchased it from somewhere else. Truly powerful Daolords
generally wouldn’t deign to do things like torture and torment
mortal cultivators. Only the weaker Daolords would generally do such
a thing. If there really was another Daolord here, he probably
would’ve sent his godsense over to investigate long ago. If he did
so, there’s no way it would’ve been able to avoid interacting
with my heartworld projection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Firesurge
nodded in agreement. “These golems all belonged to the Daolord we
just defeated. I think there probably was just one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter
if there was one or two,” Ning said. “Either way, we still need
to go into the Daolord’s estate in the very center of the
continent! The formation remains active, after all, and the core of
the formation is probably located within the Daolord’s estate. Only
if we go there will we be able to disrupt the formation and leave
this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
Daolord’s estate.” Prince Greatjoy nodded. “If there are no
other Daolords, things will be much simpler. If there is another
Daolord, then we’ll just have to give him a fight. There’s no
other options for us!”

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the rest of
the five transformed into streaks of light that flew into the air.
Space rippled around them as they then disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did these
countless cultivators who had just been freed from torture, from
their doom of eternal torment, finally come back to their senses.
They had been too stunned by the death of that ‘lord of the

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, five
Exalted Immortals, for sparing our lives!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Grand
Immortals, for saving us from an eternity of suffering!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, seniors!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless cultivators
fell to their knees in gratitude. Tears streamed down their faces as
they cried out their praises. Aside from the hundreds of millions of
cultivators who had just recently been taken prisoner, there were the
countless cultivators who had been imprisoned here long ago. They had
suffered endless torment, and only the hope of ascension and escape
had kept them alive. However… whenever those million-plus golems
noticed anyone breaking through to the late Apotheosis stage, they
would immediately kill that person! Thus, every century there was
just a very small number of cultivators who managed to overcome their
tribulations and ascend. The rest all died miserable, tormented
deaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, they finally had
release.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They would all be able
to survive. The boundless hatred and rage which had built up over the
course of countless years began to transform into gratitude towards
Ning and the rest of the five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
void-blinked straight to the location of the spacetime transfer
array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These golems.”
Heartlord Solewind waved his hand, easily binding the hundred-plus
Elder God golems present here, then split them into five lots and
gave each person a lot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does this mean…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of millions of
cultivators who were bound to the stone pillars all raised their
heads towards the skies, staring at Ning’s group of five. Those
terrifying devils had been dealt with, as easily as that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day
forth.” Heartlord Solewind swept them with his gaze as he summon
his heartworld projection, smashing apart all the chains on every
single cultivator. “You are no longer prisoners. You and the
countless cultivators who were imprisoned in that jail were all free
now. I hope you will all train hard and build up this ‘Sacred
Immortal Realm’ into a place which is truly worthy of that name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freedom?” The tens
of millions of cultivators were all stunned for a moment. Then, they
began to tremble in excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ning’s group of five quickly departed. As far as they were
concerned, helping out these mortal cultivators was nothing more than
a casual act in passing. They naturally weren’t opposed to helping
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of millions of
cultivators watched as those five airborne figures all disappeared.
Only then did they come back to their senses and hurriedly kowtow,
pressing their foreheads against the ground. “Thank you, Exalted
Immortals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for
rescuing us, Exalted Immortals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, Immortals
from the Heavens have come to deliver us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators cried
out with hoarse sobs of excitement and gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering Daolord’s
estate emanated an aura of faint green energy, and the estate itself
seemed ethereal as well, as though it didn’t quite exist at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
stared at it from afar quite cautiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, a
surge of strange power swept through the air and descended upon the
bodies of Ning and the others. Apparently, faint layers of golden
light were continuously descending upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning and the others exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Karmic merit,”
Solewind said softly. “What an enormous amount of karmic merit. All
the karmic merit I’ve ever gained since I started cultivation isn’t
as much as this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really is a lot
of karmic merit,” Prince Greatjoy said. “I once battled against
an evil cult and rescued more than three hundred chaosworlds from
their grasp, but I still didn’t get as much karmic merit as I am
right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite shocked
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At their level of
power, the effect of karmic merit was negligible, just icing on the
cake. They might have slightly better luck while adventuring, but
that was it. Still… this amount of karmic merit was simply
ridiculous in size and scope. If others knew that rescuing these
cultivators would result in such a reward of karmic merit, it was
likely that many Daolords would run around seeking opportunities to
rescue people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once your karmic merit
reached a certain level, your luck would become better and better.
Although it wouldn’t be of much use to you in the Daomerge, it
would still be of assistance when adventuring. In truth, however, you
could run around rescuing chaosworld after chaosworld and you
generally wouldn’t gain as much as one-thousandth as much karmic
merit as right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, we all saw
how the aura of hatred above in the prison had reached utterly
shocking proportions,” Solewind said. “This place had a simply
ridiculous amount of hatred. It makes sense that the reward for
rescuing them is a similarly ridiculous amount of karmic merit. It
goes without saying that the number of cultivators who were tortured
to death by them over the years was simply unimaginable. Even though
they died, their ‘echoes’ sent down karmic merit to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators they
had saved were mostly captured within the past few thousand years.
The earlier cultivators had almost all been tortured to death.
Compared to the number of cultivators they had saved, the number that
had perished was far higher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord’s
estate…” Prince Greatjoy stared at the towering estate, hidden
deep within the shadows of the faint green mist. “I feel as though
it won’t be an easy place to go through. Let us first try and see
if we can destroy it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Worth a shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can destroy
it, we can then hopefully destroy the core of the formation which
covers this entire Sacred Immortal Realm. That would be perfect.”
Ning and the others were all hoping for this outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An estate which was
being controlled by its master would possess incredibly strong
defensive powers, but now the Daolord was dead. Ning’s group did
indeed stand a good chance of destroying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go first.”
Ning smiled as he walked through the air towards the distant
Daolord’s estate. As he moved forwards, his seven mighty streaks of
Dao lightning and Dao water all flooded out as well, forming an
enormous Yin-Yang Sword Domain. A dark and terrifyingly powerful
domain appeared around him, completely annihilating all of the faint
green mist as it furiously swept towards the estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me.”
Heartlord Solewind immediately summoned his heartworld projection,
causing an entire world to come crashing down upon the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shatter!” Prince
Greatjoy flew over as well as he stretched out his giant golden
palms. His palms were capable of unleashing the most savage attacks
amongst the five. Although Ning’s own Blood Drop sword-intent was
also a Supreme Dao, its advantage lay in its penetrating power.
Prince Greatjoy, however, specialized in overwhelming, brutalizing
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two enormous,
heaven-covering golden palms came crashing down like a pair of
titanic golden clouds. The golden palms came crashing downwards
repeatedly, striking heavily upon the Daolord’s estate. The air
pressure generated by the blows was so great that an enormous
palm-size imprint appeared in the ground around the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWRAAAR!” Skyfire
Brightshore transformed into his true form of a flame-bathed beast.
His hooves kicked at the ground as his fiery tail lashed out in an
aura of absolutely power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Waterlord
Firesurge, he charged forwards and launched attacks from all around
the estate as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrance to the
Daolord’s estate was open, and so Ning’s Dao lightning and Dao
thunder flooded straight through it, smashing through all obstacles
in their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After causing absolute
havoc for a brief period of time, it finally came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? But the door to
the estate is clearing open.” The blazing beast once more
transformed into a fiery-haired youth. “Brother Darknorth’s
lightning and water, as well as my lifeblood fire… and that
heartworld projection of brother Solewind… it all flooded into the
estate to cause damage. Why, then, is the formation covering this
realm completely undisturbed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning raised
his head to stare into the skies as well. Golden runes could still be
vaguely seen high up in the air. Clearly, the enormous formation
hadn’t been impacted at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We probably haven’t
destroyed the core of the formation yet,” Ning said. “Perhaps the
core of the formation is located in some secret, hidden location
inside the estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do now?” Solewind swept the area with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What can we do? Go
inside!” Prince Greatjoy said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” A murderous
look flashed through Firesurge’s eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
felt quite cautious about this Daolord’s estate. An estate was
essentially a foe’s lair! If there really was another Daolord
inside… fighting within the estate would be incredibly
disadvantageous to Ning and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right now… there
really was no way to tell whether or not there was a Daolord inside.
If a Daolord truly decided to hide inside there and refused to come
out, then Ning’s group would still have to go inside the estate and
wreck the formation’s core in order to leave this Sacred Immortal
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
let us join forces to set up a defensive perimeter,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind’s heartworld
projection was an excellent detection and warning system, whereas
Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain was a Supreme Dao of defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, the group of
five was guarded by a chaotic domain of sword-intent as well as
countless world-shadows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group went
straight to the entrance of the Daolord’s estate. Although they had
hammered against the estate for quite some time, it remained
completely undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They entered the estate
through the main gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate was actually
quite large inside, and its internal layout was quite complicated.
There were quite a few dismembered and shattered golems located
inside of it as well, all destroyed by the water, lightning, flames,
and other attacks which the group had unleashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a large
estate.” It was built almost like a maze. Ning’s group spent a
full hour wandering inside of it, jointly defeating the various
formations and restrictive spells as they extensively searched the
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the deepest reaches
of the Daolord’s estate, there was hovering passageway that was
lined with fiery red stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. A blazing
wind howled through the air above the hovering passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a cave
entrance located amongst the many boulders present in this place.
Within this cave there was a black-robed Daolord who was seated in
the lotus position. His aura was incredibly ancient, and he was
unfathomably more powerful than the Daolord which Ning’s group had
just slain. Images of Ning and the others wandering through the
estate could be seen reflected off his eyes. “So these five
World-level cultivators really did enter my estate! For World-level
cultivators to be comparable to Daolords of the Second Step, and for
five of them to appear at once… they have to have a truly
incredible school behind them. Their master might be an extremely
important member of the Church of Annihilation. Although they killed
one of my retainers, I’d really rather not fight them unless
absolutely necessary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… Master’s
orders were clear. I am to guard this place diligently, and I am to
slay any outsiders who invade this place.” The black-robed Daolord
slowly shook his head.
</P>

Chapter 11 – Moksha
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
sat within that fiery stone cave. Suddenly, he turned his gaze
towards that levitating passageway. Deep within it, a bulky and
muscular creature was crawling across the fiery stones. The creature
was brandishing an enormous greataxe, chopping downwards with it time
and time again. Just looking at this muscular creature, one would
easily be able to tell what tremendous power this greataxe held
within it. However, the greataxe was just barely able to split the
blazing stones apart, and it took dozens of blows from the greataxe
in order to ‘harvest’ a single piece.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reverberations were
quite weak by the time they made it to the black-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Moksha.” The
black-robed Daolord called out to the creature. “Come here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” A
rumbling voice rang out from below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light flew
out from the depths of that levitating passageway, then landed within
the fiery stone cave. This was a strange, incredibly muscular thing
whose unclad body radiated a metallic light. Clearly, this was not a
normal living creature. The creature held a black greataxe in its
hands that was almost as long as he was tall, and upon entering he
immediately knelt down respectfully. “Master, what is your
bidding?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
nodded. “Five World-level children have entered the Sacred Immortal
Realm. Although they were merely at the World level, all of them can
be said to have reached a level of power comparable to that of
Daolords of the Second Step. The five of them have already entered my
estate, and they are continuously advancing in this direction! I
order you to go and wipe them out. Remember… no matter what, do not
let them damage my ‘Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Moska understands,”
the towering creature said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then go,” the
black-robed Daolord ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular creature
instantly departed through the passageway as he continuously flew
upwards. Soon, he reached the entry point to the bottommost layer of
the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
nodded slightly. He really didn’t care much about the death of that
retainer, as the retainer had been someone who had only been able to
break through thanks to a Pseudo Samsara Pill. His only real job was
to assist the black-robed Daolord in torturing those mortal
cultivators. Someone like the black-robed Daolord wouldn’t want to
lower himself or waste his energy on tormenting mortals. He would
simply order his subordinates to do it for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five absolutely
incredible World-level cultivators. They most likely stand a good
chance of becoming absolutely incredible Daolords. A pity.” The
black-robed Daolord let out a soft sigh. “Why did you have to come
here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
Daolord’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the rest of
the five were still advancing forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There has to be a
tremendous secret deep hidden within this path,” Prince Greatjoy
said. We’ve already encountered eight different restrictive seals
on this path, and it took us tremendous amounts of effort to break
through them. Why would they put this many seals here if this wasn’t
an important place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve broken quite
a few seals in the estate, but no foes have emerged to face us. There
probably really aren’t any Daolords here,” Solewind laughed. “I
hope everything will continue to be this easy. That would be just
wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that is the
case as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They advanced through
the passageway, delving deeper and deeper through the various layers
of the estate. Suddenly, an enormous stone door appeared at the end
of the path before them. This stone door was covered by strange
carvings which emanated a dark, sinful aura. Just looking at it made
the five of them uncomfortable. In truth, they had all noticed that
it seemed as though the entire estate was filled with the aura of
hatred and sin, with the aura being especially pronounced in certain
areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle, crackle,
crackle. Solewind’s heartworld projection and Ning’s sword-intent
domain both slammed into the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden runes
immediately appeared on the surface of the stone door and began to
flow across it. The runes were incredibly powerful, and they weren’t
damaged in the slightest by the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
carefully inexpected the formation which had just appeared atop the
stone door. Of the five, Heartlord Solewind possessed the highest
level of skill in the Dao of Formations. He spent quite a bit of
time, head upraised, as he stared at the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do as I say,”
Heartlord Solewind instructed. “Brother Ji Ning, strike out with
your sword using maximum force and destroy the runes over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartworld
projection immediately caused a particular part of the runes to light
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brothers Firesurge
and Skyfire, the two of you shall attack these two places.”
Heartlord Solewind once more left behind sparkles of light atop the
stone door, this time pointing out two areas with runes at the very
top and very bottom of the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Greatjoy,
all you need to do is to launch full-strength blows against this
door,” Solewind laughed. “Leave the rest to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To use raw, brute force
to breach the formations would be incredibly difficult. If you were
skilled in the art of formations, things would be much easier. Even
if you weren’t able to overcome the formation by yourself, if you
could point out certain critical areas and then focus your efforts on
those areas, it would be hundreds of times easier than simply trying
to brute-force the entire thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone… attack!”
Heartlord Solewind barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out with
his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword struck out
without creating any sound, but in the instant that it stabbed
against the divine runes, its might was fully unleashed along with a
terrifyingly strong penetrative power. If Ning wished it, he would be
able to tear space apart and enter a completely different spatial
dimension. The runes were completely pierced through and ripped apart
by Ning’s strike, resulting in the formation covering the stone
door to begin to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, a small part
of such a large formation being destroyed normally wouldn’t have
much of an impact. Only a critical part of the formation being
destroyed would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Heartlord
Solewind revealed a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword was
indeed quite terrifying. Previously, as they had been breaching one
sealed barrier after another within the estate, they had encountered
a particularly nettlesome barrier that not even Prince Greatjoy had
been able to break. In the end, it was Ning who had stepped up and
used his sword to stab through a critical part of the formation. All
of them had been stunned by how terrifyingly strong Ning’s sword
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw,
overwhelming attack power, Prince Greatjoy was the strongest of the
five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
viciousness… Ning’s sword was the deadliest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Skyfire
Brightshore and Firesurge simultaneously attacked, the former using
fire and the latter using water. These two were diametrically
different types of energy, and they were equal in power. As a result,
when they joined forces they resulted in an absolutely explosive
amount of energy being unleashed. Skyfire had truly grown much
stronger in recent years, perhaps because the twelve scrolls of the
[Sutra of Eternity] was indeed an incredible technique. By now,
Skyfire was just as strong as Firesurge, who had been the weakest
member of the four elites of the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Prince
Greatjoy sent his enormous golden palms crashing downwards towards
the two sides of the closed stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sealing barrier
twisted, no longer able to endure the surging power that had been
brought to bear against it. With a rumbling sound, the closed stone
door began to swing open as the barrier naturally broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides of the
stone door were smashed open by the twin palms, revealing an empty
pavilion behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we have reached
the end of this passageway?” Ning and the others were all stunned.
They had encountered multiple barriers on the way over and had felt
certain that there would be another passageway beyond the stone
doors. Who would’ve thought that it would instead be a pavilion?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other four
advanced with caution, surrounded by the heartworld projection and
the sword-intent domain. They walked through the stone door and into
the pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The empty pavilion was
roughly thirty thousand meters in size. An extremely muscular form
was seated within the pavilion. The creature was completely crimson
in color, and even its eyes were blazing with fire. It didn’t look
like an ordinary living creature at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golem?” Greatjoy
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
golem.” Solewind’s face tightened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord we
killed was merely at the first step. Why is there such a powerful
golem here?” Ning’s heart sank. They could all tell that this was
nothing more than a powerful golem, but it was different from those
weaker golems that had existed in the Sacred Immortal Realm. Those
golems were at the Elder God level of strength at most. This one…
it was at the Daolord level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its aura was so weighty
and dense that there was no way an ordinary Daolord could match it in
might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. There was
another stone door on the other end of the palace. That tightly
sealed stone door was covered with a layer of deep green energy that
radiated hatred, with the hatred so dense that furiously roaring
faces would constantly appear on its surface. Unfathomable amounts of
dense elemental energy were being gathered from the surrounding
areas, then channel into and through the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The hatred and
malice is all gathering here? What on earth is behind that stone
door?” Ning realized that they were getting very close to
uncovering some of the secrets behind the Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
exchanged a glance, their hearts sinking. They all knew that this
would most likely be the most deadly battle yet in this alternate
universe… and that it was possible they might die here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have entered the
Archaeus region on the orders of our master. I’d like to ask for
you to give way and release the five of us from this Sacred Immortal
Realm,” Solewind said. “If there is anything you want from us,
just tell us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive golem,
seated in the lotus position, slowly raised his head and stared at
Ning’s group with his fiery eyes. His lips parted in a savage smile
as he rose to his feet, then stretched out his left hand. Instantly,
an enormous black shield appeared within it. He then stretched out
his right hand, causing an enormous greataxe to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shield in one hand, a
greataxe in the other… and his aura completely exploded forth,
sweeping through the entire palace and causing it to echo and
thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want…” The
massive golem’s voice boomed forth, “For you all to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem transformed
into a streak of light as it charged straight towards Ning’s group.
</P>

Chapter 12 – In Danger of Dying
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire pavilion was
merely thirty thousand meters in size, and thus it was completely
filled by the Yin-Yang Sword Domain. Torrents of electric light and
watery light transformed into enormous swords that furiously hacked
at everything near them. The towering golem was assaulted by endless
attacks, but it simply roared with fury as it charged towards Ning’s
group. The Yin-Yang Sword Domain wasn’t able to do anything to it
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. Heartlord
Solewind rose high up into the air, his red robes fluttering. He
actually seemed to transform into a divine bird that was bathed in
flames. More and more of these flaming birds began to appear in the
area around him, as well as enormous amounts of blazing lava.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Focus.” Solewind
instantly manifested a total of eighteen arms, and each arm
represented a beak of a firebird as they all flew towards that golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore and
Waterlord Firesurge joined forces in a practiced manner. They had
long ago grown accustomed to combination attacks, and thus they sent
intertwined attacks of water and fire straight towards the golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he first
used [Three Heads, Six Arms], then drew out his six divine swords.
Prince Greatjoy actually manifested six arms as well, a rare sight to
behold. The two of them had the most powerful attacks… and were the
final ones to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWAAAAR!” The
massive golem roared furiously as it chopped horizontally with the
massive black greataxe in its hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This chop seemed to
sever the heavens from the earth itself. Ning and the others all
instantly felt their hearts turn cold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind had
used his heartworld projection to manifest eighteen blazing
firebirds, but they were all chopped into two pieces by this blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” Skyfire
Brightshore was sent flying back by the chop as well, and he
furiously cried out to warn the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterlord Firesurge’s
body was cleaved apart at the waist. Blood flew everywhere, and a
look of shock and rage was in his eyes. And then, his entire body
transformed into a flow of water that tried to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy’s six
enormous golden palms began to descend from the skies, striking
against the edge of that greataxe and preventing it from continuing
its attacks. Thanks to him, Skyfire and Firesurge were saved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth!”
Prince Greatjoy vomited out a mouthful of blood as he flew backwards,
but he still managed to send an urgent mental call to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six silent streaks of
sword-light. As Prince Greatjoy tied down the greataxe, the six
streaks of sword-light scraped past it and stabbed directly towards
the fingers of the golem’s right hand. Ning knew very well that
this was a golem which was as tough and resilient as a magical
treasure! To actually destroy this golem? Not even a Daolord of the
Fourth Step would be able to do this, to say nothing of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Blood Drop
stance had penetrating power, true… but it wouldn’t be able to
pierce through the golem’s body by even an inch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning had only one
goal – to attack the finger-joints on the golem’s right hand,
then seize its greataxe! Ning had been able to tell quite quickly
that this golem was at an extremely high level of skill in wielding a
greataxe. If Ning was able to disarm it and take the greataxe, the
golem would instantly lose the majority of its power! This was
similar to how if Ning himself lost his six Eternal swords he would
only be able unleash 10-20% of his true power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch. Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six streaks of
sword-light simultaneously stabbed into different finger-joints on
the golem’s right hand. The terrifying penetrative power of the
Blood Drop stance caused the fingers of the mighty golem’s right
hand to involuntarily unclench just slightly, causing its grip over
the greataxe to grow weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was delighted to
see this. Just as he was about to move forwards and seize the
greataxe…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, careful!”
Solewind’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning’s
face turned pale, because an enormous shield was crashing towards his
head with an absolutely unstoppable amount of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem smiled coldly
as it sent its enormous shield spinning towards Ning. Its greatest
proficiency lay in the art of using shields! It was created in order
to serve as a guardian for its master in dangerous situations, so as
to help buy its master some extra time. The only reason it was also
quite skilled in wielding axes was because it had been assigned to
work as a miner for countless years now. Still… comparatively
speaking, its true expertise still lay in wielding shields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the shield came
crashing down, it was as though the skies themselves were pressing
down upon Ning. Even a chaos star would most likely be reduced to
dust by a blow from this shield! As the shield moved closer and
closer to Ning, layers of multicolored space generated by the
terrifying pressure began to appear right in front of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way for
Ning to seize the greataxe. All he could do was to use his sword-arts
to defend as best as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shield slammed
directly onto Ning’s six swords. Although Ning was skilled in using
his longswords to defend, that meant very little when there was such
an enormous disparity in power. The shield crushed through Ning’s
six arms and slammed into Ning’s body. Ning felt his head grow dim
as he was sent flying backwards with a boom. He almost instantly
slammed into the walls of the pavilion, and blood immediately spewed
out of his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Prince
Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, Skyfire Brightshore, and Waterlord
Firesurge all turned pale when they saw this. They were all
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strike from that
shield… it was far more powerful than the strikes from the greataxe
had been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually made me
lose my grip over my greataxe. What a formidable sword-art! I’ll
make your death a cleaner one.” The golem charged forwards, each
step causing the pavilion to tremble. He continued to wield the
shield in one hand and the greataxe in the other as he pounced
towards Ning. Clearly, the fact that Ning had caused him to
temporarily lose his grip over his greataxe had rather irritated him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy and the
others felt their hearts turn cold when they saw this. Right now,
they didn’t really care about the greataxe any longer. It was that
shield which had them worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Ning’s
mind was still woozy, and he was only slowly regaining full
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had been
knocked completely unconscious for a brief moment. Thankfully, he had
a suit of Eternal armor protecting him, and had already completely
mastered the [Golden Idol] technique. That was the only reason why he
had been able to survive that terrifying strike! If he had a slightly
inferior protective divine ability, such as one which only made his
body comparable to the toughness of an ordinary Dao weapon, he
probably would’ve died from that collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thankfully, Ning’s
body was as tough as a top-grade Dao weapon. It wasn’t that easy to
destroy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge, brother
Darknorth!” Prince Greatjoy once more struck out with his six
golden palms towards the golem, and the golem once more bashed out
with his shield, causing that immense level of power to once more
descend upon the cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six golden palms
collided head-on with the enormous shield!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Prince
Greatjoy’s palm-arts were actually quite similar in function and
effect to the golem’s shield. In fact, Prince Greatjoy’s
techniques actually evinced a much deeper understanding of the Dao!
The problem was that the golem was simply too overwhelmingly
powerful. Prince Greatjoy just barely qualified as having the
physical power of a Daolord of the First Step, but this golem had the
power of an apex Daolord of the Third Step! Even though its technique
was rather weak, perhaps comparable to just that of a supreme World
God, it would still be able to completely dominate Prince Greatjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a golem to be able
to reach a level of mastery in using a shield which was comparable to
that of a supreme World God was actually quite incredible. After all,
golems were by nature far inferior to true cultivators in terms of
being able to understand the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden light radiated
from every part of Prince Greatjoy’s body, making him seem as
though he was made out of gold. And yet, he couldn’t help but spit
out a mouthful of golden liquid as he was sent flying backwards.
Still, his interception gave Ning the time he needed to fully regain
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!” The golem
struck out with his greataxe once more, this time chopping towards
Skyfire Brightshore and Waterlord Firesurge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.” Ning
had come back to his senses, and a cold look was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A slight ripple
suddenly appeared with the pavilion. The ripple was very delicated,
and even Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain found it difficult to detect
it. However, once the ripple moved next to the golem, the golem
revealed a look of shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vicious, insidious
streak of sword-light suddenly appeared, avoiding both the greataxe
and shield as it slashed at the golem’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem couldn’t
help but be knocked backwards. As it was knocked backwards, that
viper-like streak of sword-light appeared once more. This time, it
actually began to twist as it quickly bound the golem up in rings of
sword-light, completely trussling it up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” A
figure wreathed in black mist suddenly appeared, causing the golem to
disappear with a wave of the hand. The figure glanced at Ning. “Per
Master’s orders, you are permitted to have me help you one time.
Now that I have dealt with this golem, I have completed my promise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning was
still slumped on the ground of the pavilion. He nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This figure wreathed in
black mist was one of the four golems which Emperor Mirrorsnow had
prepared for his personal disciples… the golem known as ‘the
assassin’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The assassin instantly
disappeared, returning to the world of the Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The assassin, the
golden-robed emperor, the fisherman, and the swordsman were all
together, staring at the shield-bearing and axe-wielding golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really moved
quite quickly,” the golden-robed emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guy isn’t too
bad. He can be considered to be as physically strong as an apex
Daolord of the Third Step,” the assassin said coldly. “His
shield-wielding techniques are weak, though, and his
greataxe-wielding abilities are even weaker. Overall, he can just
barely be considered as strong as a weak Daolord of the Third Step. I
was the perfect counter for him in every respect. This was an easy
win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them were
all comparable to apex Daolords of the Third Step. In terms of speed
and power, they had actually reached the threshold of Daolords of the
Fourth Step, and they all had exceedingly profound sword-arts.
Although Ning had ‘defeated’ them, that was because Emperor
Mirrorsnow had ordered them to only use a certain level of
sword-arts! But of course, their skills were slightly inferior to
that of the sword-arts of a true Daolord of the Third Step. Thus,
they averaged out to be as strong as an apex Daolord of the Third
Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strength? Speed?
Comprehension? They surpassed this new golem in every way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to sit
there on the ground. Waterlord Firesurge slowly reformed his true
body out of the currents of water, while Skyfire Brightshore turned
to look towards Ning. Solewind let out a long, relaxed sigh. As for
Prince Greatjoy? He began to roar with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was close,”
Solewind laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth, I
owe you my life.” Prince Greatjoy looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That golem had brought
them far, far too much pressure! In the end, they were still just a
five-man group of World-level cultivators. When faced with a golem
that was comparable to a Daolord of the Third Step, they were
completely flattened with each class. If too much time passed, they
probably would’ve lost their lives.

Chapter 13 – The Black-Robed Daolord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thanks, Darknorth.”
Skyfire Brightshore and Waterlord Firesurge both looked towards Ji
Ning gratefully. Just now, had Ning been just one moment too slow,
the two of them would’ve perished. Of the five, the two of them
were undoubtedly the weakest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
just now I saw a dark figure appear, capture the golem, then say
something about only helping you once?” Prince Greatjoy frantically
asked, “We’ve disposed of the golem, but it was probably just
equivalent to a Daolord of the Third Step. There’s no way its
master was the Daolord we slew earlier… which means that it is
highly likely that a second Daolord resides within the estate. If we
can’t even deal with his golem… we’re probably going to be in
grave danger once that Daolord attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all
understood this point as well. They had disposed of the golem and
managed to stay alive, buying themselves some extra breathing time,
but the danger was still there! Still… there was nothing that could
be done! If there truly was an even more powerful Daolord here, there
was nothing they could do except face him. This was the Daolord’s
estate, after all. They were on enemy grounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, he can only
help me once.” Ning nodded. “My master once said I can’t rely
on him to deal with every danger I encounter, which is why I’ll
only be assisted a single time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatjoy, Solewind, and
the others all nodded. They understood this principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t reveal
the fact that he had three more golems. It was best for him to be
able to leave a few more trump cards up his sleeve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfire, you are a
member of the Imperials. Don’t you have any trump cards of your
own? If Darknorth had been just one second slower, you would’ve
been finished.” Greatjoy glanced at Skyfire. The five had
completely severed this local region of spacetime from the rest of
the estate, and Solewind’s heartworld projection was keeping a
close watch as well. There was no way any form of godsense or
heartforce would be able to spy on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire laughed
awkwardly. “So what if I’m a Brightshore Imperial? Shortly after
I joined the kingdom, I was dragged off by the Hegemon and sent here
to the Archaeus region. Since the entire point of this adventure is
for me to learn and grow, he naturally refused to give me any
protective treasures at all. Once you have too many trump cards, an
excursion like this would no longer be an ‘adventure’, it would
be ‘tourism’. So… I really don’t have any trump cards at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were truly surprised to hear this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very hard for
cultivators like them to acquire particularly powerful trump cards
they could use. Ning himself had to become the personal disciple of
Emperor Mirrorsnow before he learned that he would have four golems
who could each assist him once. Most likely, the other disciples of
Emperor Mirrorsnow wouldn’t divulge this fact either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
golem was, the more valuable it would be. A golem that was comparable
to a Verge-level Daolord would be an utterly priceless treasure. Even
the Sword Palace itself had only been able to acquire a few such
golems over the course of countless chaos cycles! Daolord Allgod was
an incredible grandmaster of artificing, but even he was only able to
create a single such golem in his lifetime, one which he would never
even think about selling. After all, there was simply no way one
could possibly find another such golem of tremendous power and
unswerving loyalty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow
similarly had just a single golem of such power. In the end, he had
traded it for forty golems that were comparable to apex Daolords of
the Third Step which he left behind to his personal disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus… it truly was
quite rare and difficult for one to acquire truly powerful golems!
Weaker golems, those which were comparable to Daolords of the First
Step or Second Step, were much more common. Every single one of the
twelve Daolord Cloudworlds of the Twelve Palaces had an enormous
number of these golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and the others
saw it, the person in their group who was most likely to have a
truly, ridiculously powerful trump card had to be Skyfire
Brightshore! After all, his backer was the almighty Hegemon, someone
who could truly be described as standing at the absolute apex of the
Endless Territories! Even the most casual of trump cards bestowed by
the almighty Hegemon would be terrifyingly powerful. Alas…
Skyfire’s response disappointed all four of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. This is going
to be tricky. That shieldbearer golem was roughly comparable to a
Daolord of the Third Step. Those golems are very expensive. His
master might very well be a Verge-level Daolord.” Prince Greatjoy
was rather worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent a divine
power clone to descend upon the estate-world of the Mirrorsnow
Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen.” Ning
looked at the assassin, the fisherman, the golden-robed emperor, and
the swordsman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you help me bind
this golem?” Ning glanced at the captured shieldbearer golem.
Although it was much weaker than the golems which Emperor Mirrorsnow
had left behind, it still had the power of a Daolord of the Third
Step and was capable of dominating Ning’s group and even killing
them in a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Ning had
‘cheated’ by releasing an even more terrifying golem… the
assassin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we helped
you tie it down, you wouldn’t be able to bind it.” The
golden-robed emperor shook his head. “All we can do is keep it
trapped here and make sure it can’t fight back. In the end, it is
still an extraordinary golem, while your Immortal energy remains at
the World level. If you wish to forcibly send your energy into the
golem’s body and wipe out its master’s seal… there’s no way
you can do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
simply hoped that the four golems might have some special tricks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mighty golem
comparable to a Daolord of the Third Step was right in front of him,
helpless and bound, but there was no way for him to bind it. It was a
pity that his azureflower mist energy was unable to leave his body.
Otherwise, he might’ve been able to use it to bind the golem
instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a question
for you.” Ning shifted his gaze to the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
towering golem let out a cold snort. “Stop struggling, brat. The
five of you are all going to die. You have no idea who you just
pissed off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? And who did we
just piss off?” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
towering golem swept the area with his gaze, his eyes blazing with
fire. He let out a snicker. “There are some things which I cannot
speak about… but although these golems of yours are a bit stronger
than me, they aren’t that much stronger. Even if all of them helped
you out, you still would have no chance at all of surviving this
encounter. You won’t even be able to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed coldly.
“Oh, so you were talking about the Daolord behind you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know soon
enough.” The towering golem shut his mouth, saying nothing further.
There were some secrets which even he didn’t dare to divulge. He
had received strict orders long ago regarding these matters, and as a
golem he would never violate the orders he was given.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but begin to worry even more. Judging from the golem’s behavior,
the golem seemed to feel supremely confident in the outcome of this
fight. Why? What gave it such confidence?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Were the five of them
really going to die here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t that
afraid, as he had a clone in the outside world which would allow him
to rebuild his body. Although he would’ve lost six Eternal weapons,
four powerful golems, and the seven streaks of Dao water and Dao
lightning in his body… he would still be alive. The price he paid
for dying here would be a heavy one, but so long as he remained alive
there would always be more possibilities in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had no idea as
to whether or not Greatjoy, Solewind, Skyfire Brightshore, and
Firesurge had clones in the outside world. There were some secrets
which you simply didn’t ask or tell others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the five of
them knew that the situation was dangerous, they had no way out. They
had to face it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The five
of them joined forces once more to slam open the stone doors on the
other side of the pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the stone
doors began to slowly swing open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning and
the others all took deep breaths. The aura of hatred and resentment
here had to be a thousand times greater than the aura had been in the
air above the great prison. The hatred was so intense, it had
liquefied into a deep green pool that was swirling in a vortex of
more than a hundred ‘streams’ of hatred that circled an
absolutely beautiful, enormous flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This flower had many
black leaves. Ning counted exactly a thousand of those black leaves,
and they were layered atop each other in a strange, evil, yet
beautiful way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the leaves there
were the soul-stirringly beautiful petals. The flower petals were
multicolored and emanated an aura of intoxicating fragrance. They
were truly dazzling in their beauty, and they emanated faint streams
of rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was all that hatred
meant to nourish this flower?” Ning and the others felt their
hearts tremble when they saw this sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deep green streams
of hatred all centered around this pool, condensing into an actual
liquid form which then split off in a hundred streams which were used
to nourish the flower in an extremely detail-oriented manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Prismatic Kiloleaf
Flower?” Heartlord Solewind murmured these words softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t those
flowers supposed to be impossible to cultivate? I thought they could
only grow naturally in certain environments.” Prince Greatjoy was
shocked as well. Ning and the others all had heard of the
awe-inspiringly famous ‘Prismatic Kiloleaf Flowers’, which were
known throughout the Endless Territories. It was one of several
precious ingredients that were needed to refine some truly powerful
magic treasures, and it was incredibly precious. A single flower
would be worth roughly a million cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, based on what
Ning and the others knew, these flowers could only grow in natural
environments. But now, it seemed as though there was a major power
who was capable of actually growing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This is a
Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower.” A voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
simultaneously turned their heads to look. They saw a streak of dark
light slowly manifest in the skies, revealing an ethereal figure
which slowly began to materialize into a black-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
landed, staring at the Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower with a distant look
in his eyes. He then turned to sweep the five of them with his gaze.
“The five of you are able to match Daolords of the Second Step,
despite merely being at the World level. I imagine you all have
incredible backgrounds! Not even my master himself would be willing
to offend the major power who undoubtedly stands behind you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
felt their hearts turned cold. The more casually this Daolord spoke,
the more nervous they became. Only someone who possessed an
absolutely overwhelming advantage in power would act so casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, then why don’t you let us leave, senior? We can immediately
swear oaths to never divulge any information regarding the Sacred
Immortal realm to anyone,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haven’t you
noticed? Ever since you entered the Sacred Immortal Realm, all your
connections to the outside world have been completely cut off.” The
black-robed Daolord looked curiously at them. “The reason we set up
the formation which separated this realm from the rest of the
universe was to prevent anyone from leaking information about it. And
now that you’ve seen the Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower… don’t you
know who you’ve just offended?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
blinked. They really had no idea, because they weren’t from this
universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how
monstrously talented you are, the sect behind you has to be an
incredibly powerful one. I imagine that your sect would’ve told you
about the most powerful members of the Church of Annihilation.” The
black-robed Daolord was puzzled. “The only person in the entire
universe who can grow these Prismatic Kiloleaf Flowers is my master,
Emperor Trisilk? Don’t you know anything?”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
exchanged glances, their hearts quivering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Trisilk?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had naturally
never heard of this ‘Emperor Trisilk’ before, but even a fool
could understand that he had to be an Eternal Emperor! And
supposedly, he was the master of this black-robed Daolord and was the
only person in this entire alternate universe who could plant
Prismatic Kiloleaf Flowers. Clearly, he was not just an Eternal
Emperor, he was an incredible one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of us just
wanted to journey through the Archaeus region. How the hell did we
manage to run afoul of an Eternal Emperor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the black-robed
Daolord saw how the faces of Ning and the others all turned pale, he
couldn’t help but laugh. “It seems you now understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he is an
Eternal Emperor? My master slays Eternal Emperors as easily as
turning over his hand,” Prince Greatjoy said coldly. “You had
best let us go. Otherwise… given my master’s abilities, he’ll
definitely be able to find out who killed us, even if it ends up
being a bit troublesome for him! It won’t just be you who will be
doomed; Emperor Trisilk himself won’t be able to withstand Master’s
wrath!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to threaten
me.” The black-robed Daolord smiled. “The five of you are at the
World level, but talented enough to match Daolords of the Second
Step. Not even my master himself has five such talented disciples
under his tutelage. I find it highly likely that one of the sixteen
Starkings of the Church of Annihilation stands behind the five of
you. Am I right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew a bit about
the Church of Annihilation. The most exalted member of the Church of
Annihilation was, without a doubt, its legendary leader! Their leader
was the person who unified this entire alternate universe, and he was
unspeakably powerful to the point of being virtually omnipotent. Most
likely, not even the almighty Hegemon would be a match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second to the leader
were the sixteen Starkings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below the Starkings
were the mighty Paladins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Nine Godstars
sect’ which Ning’s group had originally encountered upon entering
this alternate universe only had a single Paladin in their
organization! Generally speaking, ordinary Verge-level Daolords were
not qualified to be given the rank of ‘Paladin’. Only
breathtakingly powerful Daolords, along with Eternal Emperors, were
qualified to be called ‘Paladins’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said a while
ago, not even my master would wish to offend the person who stands
behind the five of you. Alas… it was your own fault for barging
into the Sacred Immortal Realm. It no longer matters how powerful the
person who stands behind you is.” The black-robed Daolord laughed.
“In order to prevent your school and master from tracking you down…
as soon as you entered my estate, I sent my subordinates to destroy
the spacetime transfer arrays linking the ‘Mortal Realm’ with
this ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning and the
others were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
that ‘Mortal Realm’ will no longer be connected to this world of
ours.” The black-robed Daolord sighed. “Because of the five of
you, I had to sacrifice a large continent. Alas, I had to ensure that
there would be no way for your school to trace you to this place and
attack me here. I decided to remove all traces of your passing right
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the spacetime
transfer array between the Mortal Realm and the Sacred Immortal Realm
was destroyed, then even if a major power managed to track Ning’s
group to the Mortal Realm, there would be no way for him to find out
where the Sacred Immortal Realm was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the outside
world, the only person who even knows this ‘Sacred Immortal Realm’
exists is my master.” The black-robed Daolord smiled coldly. “As
for myself, I’ve been permanently assigned to this place. Without
Master’s permission, even I shall never be permitted to leave. As
for the formation which surrounds this realm, my master was the one
who personally set it up. It ensures that this realm is completely
separated from the rest of the world. Even if you have other clones
outside, there will be no way you can sense where this realm is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus… no one knows
that you are here, and no one will be able to find you. As for
fighting back? Hmph. My master personally set up this formation, and
I’m the only person who can fully unleash its power. Not even a
Verge-level Daolord who stumbles into this place would be a match for
me.” The black-robed Daolord swept the five with his gaze.
“However… I have decided to give you a way to survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A way to survive?”
Ning and the others stared at the black-robed Daolord. They had
guessed long ago that the Daolord had ulterior motives, which was why
he had spoken to them for so long. If he truly wanted to kill them,
he would’ve done so long ago. Why would he first let them view the
Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower and ensure they felt despair at knowing
they had transgressed against Emperor Trisilk?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they truly were
geniuses who belonged to this universe, they probably would’ve felt
despair upon hearing Emperor Trisilk’s name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Trisilk was a
true demon who had committed towering sins, and it was his idea to
use enormous amounts of hatred to nourish Prismatic Kiloleaf Flowers.
Just imagine how skilled he was in sin and how steeped he was in
hate, for him to be able to manipulate it so effectively? As a man
who had committed many sins, he had offended many major powers over
the course of his life… and yet, he was still alive. Although he
was merely a Paladin of the Church of Annihilation, he truly was
skilled in staying alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all… Emperor Trisilk’s true specialty lay in torture. He could
torture even Daolords to the brink of insanity, causing them to
choose to commit suicide or to submit to him. All of his disciples
were skilled in torture as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, a way to
survive. If you are willing to swear lifeblood oaths to serve me
forever and to obey my orders as my slaves, I’ll spare you.” The
black-robed Daolord stared at Ning’s group, his eyes gleaming. The
five of them were all monstrously talented cultivators who could
become Daolords whenever they chose. Once they became Daolords, their
future potential would be limitless. It was entirely possible that
all five of them would become more powerful than the black-robed
Daolord himself. And, if he had them work for him as miners after
they became Daolords, they would definitely be far more effective
than the shieldbearer golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had given
him strict orders, true… but that was to prevent any secrets from
being released. If these five swore lifeblood oaths to become his
slaves, then there was naturally no chance of anything going astray.
Even better, with these extra subordinates helping him mine this
place he would be able to finish his task much faster and thus no
longer need to remain here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Become slaves?”
The faces of all five tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible,”
Solewind roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing is
impossible.” The black-robed Daolord laughed. “In the face of
death… everything becomes possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change your
conditions,” Solewind growled. “We would die before becoming your
slaves. We can carry out tasks for you and swear to divulge no
information about this place to the outside world, but there’s
absolutely no way we will become your slaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smile disappeared
from the black-robed Daolord’s face, only to be replaced by an icy
coldness. “You only have one choice – become slaves and live, or
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us think it
over.” Solewind gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
stared coldly at the five of them. “Make it fast.” As he spoke, a
savage-looking serpent began to appear in the air around him. The
giant serpent coiled around the black-robed Daolord as it stared
coldly at Ning’s group with its emotionless reptilian eyes. Ning
and the others couldn’t help but shiver when they saw this. They
knew that it could probably wipe them out in a single blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
Solewind, Ning, Greatjoy, Skyfire, and Firesurge traded glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of this
formation truly is incredible. He was telling the truth. Here in the
Sacred Immortal Realm, not even Verge-level Daolords would be able to
defeat him.” Prince Greatjoy sent mentally, “What should we do? I
have a few trump cards, but they would at most be able to deal with
Daolords of the Third Step. They wouldn’t even be enough to deal
with that shieldbearer golem we just fought, much less this Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Firesurge
had an ugly look on his face as well. As for Skyfire, he didn’t say
a word. He really didn’t have any trump cards at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
sat there leisurely next to the Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower, the
enormous black serpent continuing to coil around him. He said softly,
“Tell me your choice. Do you choose life… or death?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“LIFE!” A voice
suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
cracked a smile as he looked at the speaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, him and
three others also stared at the speaker in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Heartlord
Solewind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind had
just crushed an odd-looking jade pendant in his hands, causing an
arcane surge of terrifying power to descend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was formless.
Colorless. Shapeless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t see it or sense it at all; all they could sense was that
something utterly terrifying had just appeared as a wave of something
washed over them. The black-robed Daolord’s smile turned stiff, and
a look of utter terror appeared in his eyes. He opened his mouth as
though he was about to say something… but then, all traces of life
fled from his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing left was
his seated corpse, and it no longer had any trace of life in it at
all. As for the terrifying serpent that hd been created by the power
of the formation? It completely dissipated into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He died?” Ning and
the other three were boggled as they stared at Heartlord Solewind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. Just like that,
I was forced to use up the life-saving Dao-seal the Heartforce Palace
bestowed up on me.” Heartlord Solewind sighed softly. “Dao-seals
like that aren’t available for sale anywhere. The power of each
seal is incredibly great, equivalent to the Palace Lord himself
striking with 30% of his maximum power. It could easily kill even a
Verge-level Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens. A
Dao-seal comparable to a 30% maximum power strike from the Palace
Lord of the Palace of the Heart? The Heartforce Palace truly had very
few Daolords, but it was one of the most terrifying palaces of the
Twelve Palaces precisely because each of them truly were incredibly
powerful. As for the Palace Lord, if he was to personally intervene
even Eternal Emperors would turn pale with fright and scamper off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strike which
contained 30% of his full power… such a blow would threaten even
Eternal Emperors to a certain extent, much less ordinary Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Dao-seal is…
a bit ridiculous.” Prince Greatjoy was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you sure you are
the Imperial, not him?” Firesurge glanced at Skykfire Brightshore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s just…”
Skyfire Brightshore mumbled…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Heartforce
Palace is different from your palaces. We have very vew members, and
so we truly treat every member as we would family. I naturally was
given a few protective measures for this adventure.” Heartlord
Solewind smiled. “A pity. I only was given two Dao-seals of this
level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have another
one?!” All four of the others were starting to grow jealous. It
seemed as though the old saying, ‘less is more’, really was true.
The Heartforce Palace had very few members, which was why it was
incredibly kind to those few members it had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy glanced
sideways at the seated, lifeless corpse of the black-robed Daolord.
The black-robed Daolord had a look of utter terror on his face, and
his mouth was open. Clearly, death had descended upon him with
incredible speed. He had died while still gripped by astonishment.
</P>

Chapter 15 – The Secret of the Sacred Immortal Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
stared at the black-robed Daolord’s corpse, then said, “This
Daolord was quite extraordinary. He was most likely the second and
final Daolord here in the Sacred Immortal Realm. Now that he’s
dead, we’ll probably be able to leave this place soon! It is
possible that his master, Emperor Trisilk, might have some unique
methods which would alert him of his disiciple’s death. He might be
heading towards this place right now. Once he arrives, we’ll truly
be doomed. We need to get out of here as soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the Heart
might’ve given Solewind a powerful protective Dao-seal, but it
wouldn’t be enough to kill an Eternal Emperor; at most, it would
just tie him down for a period of time. Even if the Palace Lord was
personally present, it would be quite difficult for him to actually
slay an Eternal Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll collect the
corpse for now. After we escape from the Sacred Immortal Realm, we
can bind his storage treasures and split those things up,” Solewind
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Prince
Greatjoy immediately argued, “Solewind, you used a life-saving
Dao-seal to kill him. All the treasures will naturally belong to you.
You used up a Dao-seal that represented 30% of a maximum-power strike
from the Palace Lord of the Heartforce Palace! I imagine we could
sell off all of this Daolord’s items, and it still wouldn’t be
worth as much as that Dao-seal was. Even if you took everything, you
are still coming out behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind was
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Solewind.”
Skyfire Brightshore said the same thing. “We’re certainly not
going to take advantage of you like this. We can split up the
treasures we earned from killing that weak Daolord of the First Step,
but that golem and this black-robed Daolord’s treasures shall
belong to Darknorth and yourself, respectively. You used up an
extremely powerful Dao-seal, while brother Darknorth had to use up
that favor from his helper.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two affairs
aren’t comparable. Brother Darknorth captured that golem, but
there’s no way we could possibly split it up. The Daolord’s
treasures, however, are useful for everyone,” Solewind argued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unnecessary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop quibbling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re not taking
it, and there’s nothing you can do to convince us otherwise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
laughed as they rejected Solewind’s suggestions. They had known
each other for thousands of years by now, and all of them were quite
friendly with each other. Of the find, Solewind was the most logical
and the most trustworthy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind shook his
head, then said with resignation, “Fine, then. I’ll be shameless
and accept it all. Oh, right. This Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower is
pretty much at full maturity as well. Let’s harvest it. I’ll take
all of the black-robed Daolord’s treasures, but we can split up the
value of the flower later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Harvest it first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterlord Firesurge
waved his hand. Instantly, a stream of water surged out and formed a
giant hand that gently cupped the distant, beautiful flower, then
plucked it all at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let us keep on
exploring,” Prince Greatjoy said. “We still have yet to find the
core of this formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to breach
the formation. Only then will we be able to leave this Sacred
Immortal Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other five
quickly began to advance once more. There would be plenty of time for
them to split up the treasures later. Right now, every extra second
they spent in this Sacred Immortal Realm was another second of danger
for them! Who knew when Emperor Trisilk would come back? Although
logically speaking the Sacred Immortal Realm had that enormous
formation which completely separated it from the outside world, which
meant Emperor Trisilk shouldn’t be aware of the black-robed
Daolord’s death, in the end it was the Eternal Emperor himself who
had set up this formation. He might’ve put in certain mechanisms
that would let him know about what was happening in the Sacred
Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was an Eternal
Emperor. Even if he was very far away, it probably wouldn’t take
him that long to hasten to the Sacred Immortal Realm. If the five of
them were caught here, they really would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were no further
barriers in front of them. The planting grounds for the flower had
essentially been the most important place in the entire estate, after
all. They pushed open the enormous stone door in front of them, only
to see a circular hallway behind it. The hallway was filled with
complicated formations made from divine runes, and Immortal energy
flowed through the runes with incredible power. More than ten
thousand strange types of stones were present as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the stones were
jewel-like, some were white and slick, some were dark and gloomy,
while some emanated auras of incredible cold. All sorts of different,
strange stones were scattered throughout this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re rich!”
Prince Greatjoy’s eyes bulged out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many treasures?!”
Solewind swept the room with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All combined, these
stones have to be worth at least ten million cubes!” Ning was
shocked by the implications of this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens. Ten
million cubes? This was an absolutely enormous sum of money, even for
a Verge-level Daolord… but these stones were merely being used to
power this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll split up
these treasures into five portions. Each of us will get a portion,”
Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, alright!
We’ll be shameless enough to accept that suggestion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatjoy and Ji Ning
didn’t decline either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, all of them
felt rather puzzled and suspicious. From what the black-robed Daolord
had said, this formation was personally set up by that Eternal
Emperor, who had ordered the black-robed Daolord to protect this
place! What secrets did this place hold, for the Eternal Emperor to
order such a powerful Daolord to stay here permanently? Why did he
pay such an enormous price and personally set up such a complicated
formation here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one is in command
of the formation, and the formation’s core is the weakest part of
any formation. It’ll be easy to break it apart. Don’t move,
everyone. Let me deal with it,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although no one was in
command of the formation, it still took someone at the Daolord level
of power to break it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind carefully
picked up one precious stone after another. After carefully picking
up a total of twelve stones, the power of the formation began to
fade. Solewind grinned. “Next… you can do whatever you like. This
formation is no longer able to fight back against us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
worked in concert, each of them collecting roughly a fifth of the
total number of treasures present. With the treasures all collected,
the formation naturally broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation is
done for. We can leave now.” Prince Greatjoy revealed a look of
delight. “However… we still haven’t discovered what secrets
this place is holding, for an Eternal Emperor to set both formations
and guards over this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are no other
passageways from this estate,” Solewind said. “The mysteries
don’t matter. Let’s leave first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There really were no
other passageways for them to take. They had gone as deep as they
could into the estate, and they had already discovered the core of
formation at the bottommost layer of the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
moved incredibly fast. In just a single breath’s worth of time,
they flew out of the estate. There were no longer any barriers here
to slow them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
others raised their heads to stare at the skies. Their faces all
turned pale. “Not good.” All of them felt shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation-barrier
covering the entire Sacred Immortal Realm had already broken down,
revealing the world beyond. Outside the Sacred Immortal Realm was an
endless sea of blazing, roiling energy. There were also enormous
blazing stones that was flying through the skies. In short, it was an
absolutely apocalyptic hell of fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The barrier had
completely blocked off the outside world, but it had also protected
the Sacred Immortal Realm. Now that the formation had been cancelled
out, the borders of the Sacred Immortal Realm actually began to
collapse as the blazing flames of the inferno surrounding it
descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sacred Immortal
Realm is about to break apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us give those
mortals a hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
could immediately tell that there was no way they could save the
Sacred Immortal Realm. They immediately began to teleport to the
places where the cultivators were gathered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while ago,
the cultivators had been released from their nightmare and regained
their freedom. They were planning out how to establish a home for
themselves when all of a sudden, something terrifying had appeared in
the skies. Endless, flowing streams of blazing energy began to sweep
downwards towards them. All of them knew that they were going to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could only watch
as the fires of hell began to descend towards them. There was no way
they could fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” Ning
appeared out of nowhere, then waved his hand and caused more than ten
million cultivators to be drawn into his estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.”
Heartlord Solewind appeared in another part of the world, rescuing
the utterly terrified and despairing cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In just two breath’s
worth of time, all of the cultivators in the entire continent had
been rescued by Ning’s group of five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing streams of
fire and the flaming boulders came crashing downwards. Each time they
struck against the Sacred Immortal Realm, the entire continent would
tremble and shake. The entire continent began to break and crumble
apart into multiple pieces. It was completely disintegrating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all extraordinarily powerful. The power of the apocalyptic
flames was enough to ruin this realm, but it wasn’t enough to harm
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They just stood there
in the air, surrounded by the Yin-Yang Sword Domain which stretched
off ten thousand kilometers. The blazing streams of energy and the
flaming bouldesr were immediately destroyed once they moved close to
the group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The continent is
finished.” After rescuing the mortal cultivators, Ning and the
others just watched and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, over there!”
Prince Greatjoy’s face changed as he pointed towards part of the
Daolord’s estate. Now that the entire continent had broken apart,
they were able to see something which had been hidden at the very
bottom of the continent. There, they could see an enormous levitating
mountain that was formed out of fiery rocks. The peak of the mountain
was roughly a million kilometers in size, and there were strange
spatial ripples covering it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An entire mountain
of darkspace flamestone?” Ning and the others were completely
stunned.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the rest of
the five all immediately teleported closer towards that fiery-red
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire place was
filled with blazing streams of energy, but they weren’t nearly as
dangerous to Ning and the others as the spatial tempests around the
Mortal Realm had been. Despite the harsh environment, Ning and the
others were actually able to engage in spatial teleportation here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I seeing this? Is
this actually an entire mountain of darkspace flamestone?” Prince
Greatjoy raised his head to stare at the towering mountain, unable to
maintain his usual calm. A stunned look was on his face. “Am I
asleep? Am I dreaming…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An entire freaking
mountain? Completely comprised of darkspace flamestone?” Solewind
was dazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By my calculations…
every ten thousand kilograms of that mountain can be refined into one
kilogram of pure darkspace flamestone.” Ning mumbled to himself,
“The entire mountain stretches out to cover more than a million
kilometers. How much darkspace flamestone is that? How much is it
worth? I can’t… I can’t even calculate…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Insane. Absolutely
insane!” Firesurge and Skyfire were both stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an
incalculably valuable treasury, one which Eternal Emperors go berserk
over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darkspace flamestone
was an extremely valuable type of mineral which could be used in many
different ways. It could be used to forge golems and magic treasures,
and there were even certain secret arts and divine abilities that
made use of it. Generally speaking, it could be discovered in certain
unique environments, but it was generally discovered in meter-sized
amounts or even less.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An entire mountain that
was over a million kilometers in size? This was a veritable quarry of
darkspace flamestone! In fact, Ning and the others suspected this of
being the largest deposit of darkspace flamestone in this entire
alternate universe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
primordial chaos often gave birth to many types of unique treasures.
In the Endless Territories, the Brightshore Kingdom had taken sole
ownership over Hydragon Mountain. Although the quality of ore was
inferior to the darkspace flamestone here, the total amount of ore it
possessed was a million times greater, making Hydragon Mountain far
more valuable than this one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… no matter
what, this was an enormous mountain with more than a million
kilometers of darkspace flamestone. Most likely, only Hegemon-level
figures would be qualified to own such a place without fearing that
others would seek to seize it. Generally speaking, Eternal Emperors
who discovered such a fortune would mine in secret. They simply
weren’t strong enough to openly claim sole ownership over such a
fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder. No wonder
Emperor Trisilk sent his disciple to stand guard over this place,”
Solewind mumbled. “No wonder he was willing to attack us, even
though he knew that we all had extraordinary backgrounds. They really
can’t risk letting the secret of this mountain get out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! A
deep sound rang out. Skyfire Brightshore had picked up an axe-shaped
treasure and was using it to hack away at the mountain in front of
him. Alas, he was only able to leave a few white marks behind on the
fiery ore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t hack it
apart.” Skyfire blinked a few times as he muttered softly to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wake up, guys! Wake
up!” When Ning heard Skyfire mumble those words, he shivered then
began to call out to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four stared
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop daydreaming.
This is an entire mountain of darkspace flamestone. We can’t even
cut into it, much less mine it.” Ning shook his head. “I’d
imagine only Daolords of the Third Step would be strong enough to
just barely excavate some of the ore, and only at a very slow speed
at that. This entire mountain is a million kilometers in size, and
there’s no way for us to teleport it away. There’s nothing we can
do at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood.
There was literally nothing they could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about them; not
even Eternal Emperors or the almighty Hegemon would be able to do
anything to such a vast mountain of precious minerals! Thus, Emperor
Trisilk had elected to send a powerful Daolord and golems here to
slowly mine away at the ore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single piece of
ore was a priceless treasure. A mountain of ore which was a million
kilometers in size naturally was filled with certain arcane powers.
In fact, it was being reinforced by some of the prime essences of
this entire alternate universe. If you wished to move it by just a
few kilometers… most likely, there were incredibly few figures in
this entire alternate universe who would be capable of such a thing.
To store it away into an estate-world? Completely impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Think about Hydragon
Mountain. The almighty Hegemon was incredibly skilled in the Dao of
Spacetime, but even he was forced to resort to sending subordinates
to slowly mine away at the ore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
Skyfire Brightshore stared at Ning and the other three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can only look,
not touch.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is
nothing we can do.” Solewind shook his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All we can do is
stare. And drool.” Firesurge licked his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least we had the
chance to see such a mountain of ore,” Prince Greatjoy said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them just
stared at that mountain, their gazes blazing with lust. They were
like five ordinary mortals who encountered an enormous mountain that
was completely made out of gold. Although there was no way to move
it, just staring at it was still a stunning experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Greatjoy said. “If we waste too much time and end up being caught
by Emperor Trisilk, we’ll be in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, this
isn’t something which we are qualified to own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all men of talent. Although they were temporarily stunned by
this sight for a time, they quickly came to the decision to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Prince Greatjoy
took control over their flying vessel, and they left this place at
high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to take
possession over such an inconceivably valuable place, you had to have
the corresponding level of power! If you weren’t strong enough,
then you would have to do what Emperor Trisilk did; secretly mine
away without anyone knowing about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
was a good example. The first to discover Hydragon Mountain wasn’t
actually him, it was a group of adventuring World-level cultivators.
In the end, there had been a grand battle, resulting in the almighty
Hegemon taking sole ownership over Hydragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Church of
Annihilation, in turn, had taken completely control over this entire
alternate universe, becoming its paramount power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, power was
what mattered the most!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
advanced at maximum speed, relying on Prince Greatjoy’s mastery
over spacetime to flee as fast as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… this time,
their guess was wrong. Right now, Emperor Trisilk was in no mood to
search for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within another
part of the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space was in chaos
here, and spacetime itself trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
inhospitable environment. Not even major powers would come here, but
a translucent, virtually invisible drop of water was floating through
this region of chaotic spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that drop of
water, there was an estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit, shit.” A
sinister-looking youth with nine malignant tumors on the top of his
head was seated in the lotus position, grinding his teeth. “That
old bastard Maniseal really is like a ghost that just won’t go
away. It’s been nearly nineteen chaos cycles, but he’s still
chasing after me. Is he never going to get tired of this? Shit, shit,
shit! I really regret pissing him off. Who would’ve imagined that
the silent old fellow would be this powerful? If I knew, I would
never have pissed him off. If it wasn’t for the fact that I,
Trisilk, am skilled at staying alive, I would’ve died by his hands
long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly felt regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Trisilk was
consumed with regret. He was a lawless figure who had committed
countless sins. He was willing to do anything if it meant growing
more powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Maniseal was an
extremely low-key Eternal Emperor. He was known as a very good man
who spent all his time training his disciples within his own
territory. He was often taken advantage of by others in the Church of
Annihilation, but he didn’t really care too much. Emperor Trisilk
had thought Emperor Maniseal to be a complete pushover, and so when
he heard that Emperor Maniseal had bestowed an incredibly valuable
treasure known as the Violetbolt of Icy Flames to his second
disciple, Trisilk had decided to take it. He had slain Emperor
Maniseal’s beloved second disciple, then stolen the Violetbolt of
Icy Flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a treasure
that was used to meditate on the Dao. When you kept it by your side,
your heart and mind would become extremely calm, making it much
easier and faster for you to comprehend the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons why
Emperor Maniseal had been able to succeed in his Daomerge was because
of this treasure! His second disciple was a Verge-level Daolord as
well, and so he had chosen to give his disciple this treasure. Who
would’ve thought that it would end up in that disciple being
killed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been enraged.
For the first time in many years, Emperor Maniseal had been truly
enraged!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His second disciple was
the disciple he loved the most. His eldest disciple had long ago
perished while adventuring, which meant his second disciple had been
by his side the longest. He treated this second disciple as he would
a son. Emperor Maniseal spared no expense to investigate the matter,
in the end discovering that it had been Emperor Trisilk who had been
the culprit! Emperor Trisilk had been too arrogant, feeling that
Emperor Maniseal would not pose any threat to him. Otherwise, he
wouldn’t have been discovered to be the culprit with such ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Emperor Maniseal
discovered who the murderer was, he left his home and began to chase
after Emperor Trisilk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This chase…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stunned this entire
alternate universe! Only now did they understand how terrifyingly
strong Emperor Maniseal was. He was close to being on par with the
sixteen Starkings! If he was just a tiny bit stronger, he probably
would’ve been bestowed with the formal title of ‘Starking’ by
the Church of Annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With such a powerful
figure pursuing him, Emperor Trisilk was forced to use up two of his
most valuable life-saving treasures. He had even tossed the
Violetbolt of Icy Flames over to Emperor Maniseal and asked other
major powers to intercede on his behalf, but it was all to no avail.
The kindly, good-natured Emperor Maniseal had been truly enraged. He
had chased after Emperor Trisilk for nineteen entire chaos cycles,
and he still continued the chase without relenting in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten chaos cycles, a
hundred chaos cycles, or a thousand chaos cycles… so long as I,
Maniseal, am still alive, I swear I shall one day slay Trisilk.”
These were the words which Emperor Maniseal had said long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Emperor Trisilk
could do was hide as best he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The universe was a vast
place. If an Eternal Emperor wished to hide, it would be very
difficult for anyone to find him. However… by the same principle,
for a major power like Emperor Maniseal to unrelentingly search for
and chase after you was an utter nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What horrible luck.
Even my mountain of darkspace flamestone was discovered?” Emperor
Trisilk muttered angrily to himself. He could sense his disciple’s
death, but he didn’t dare to go and investigate what had happened.
“My disciple had the power of a peak Daolord of the Third Step.
With my formation supporting him, not even Verge-level Daolords would
be a match for him. I wonder who killed him? Maybe that old bastard
Maniseal knows about it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others,
however, didn’t know any of this. Terrified of being discovered,
they quickly moved towards the core parts of the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think Emperor
Trisilk will be able to invert the flows of spacetime to find our
tracks?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
Archaeus region is huge! It won’t be that easy for him to find us.”
Ning and the others didn’t dare to relax in the slightest… but
they had no idea that Emperor Trisilk was in no position to worry
about anything besides keeping himself alive.

Chapter 17 – A Group of Eight
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving the
Sacred Immortal Realm, Ji Ning and the others spent three hundred
years in flight. Only after they felt that had fled a sufficiently
long distance did they begin to divide up their loot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel was
lazily drifting through the void of the Archaeus region. Ning and the
rest of the five were seated within the vessel, counting their
earnings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That weak Daolord
actually had quite a few treasures, including two Prismatic Kiloleaf
Flowers. If we add those two to the one which we harvested, that
means we have three! He also had an Archaeus medallion as well as
these other treasures…” Heartlord Solewind had placed the many
treasures he had found across the deck of the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s quite a
lot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! That weak
Daolord certainly had quite a lot of treasures.” Ning and the
others were all pleasantly surprised by this. What they didn’t
realize was that the stooped, green-robed Daolord had been assigned
all of the more taxing tasks, such as tormenting the cultivators and
taking care of the flowers. The actual planting and nurturing of a
Prismatic Kiloleaf Flower was an extremely exhausting job, and each
time a flower grew to maturity he would head over and harvest it.
Although the harvested flowers were temporarily left with him, once
their group left the Sacred Immortal Realm he would’ve had to hand
it over to the black-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should we split
these things up?” Skyfire Brightshore asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are an honorable
prince of the Brightshore Imperials. Why are you trying to haggle
over treasures with commoners like us?” Firesurge teased him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this?
Let’s consider the three flowers as three ‘portions’ of
treasures, an Archaeus medallion as one portion, and all of those
other treasures as a fifth portion. Each of us will get one portion,
and we can choose as we please,” Heartlord Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stooped Daolord
truly did have quite ac ollection of treasures, including a bit of
darkspace flamestone. Although he didn’t have that much of the
flamestone, the amount he did have was still worth close to a million
cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want the Archaeus
medallion,” Prince Greatjoy said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want…” Ning
spoke out at the same time, then paused, slightly stunned. He wanted
the Archaeus medallion as well! Su Youji had been a master-class
Chaos Immortal when she first acquired the legacy of Feixian the
Exalted. Feixian the Exalted had been an extremely powerful Daolord,
and his legacy was very well-suited for Su Youji. As a result, she
now had the power of a supreme Chaos Immortal. This opportunity in
the Archaeus region wasn’t to be missed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she was given an
Archaeus medallion, she would be able to journey alongside the five.
She might grow a bit more stronger, in which case she could very well
be able to break through to become a Samsara Daolord herself! A
Samsara Daolord who knew the secrets arts of Feixian the Exalted
would be a terrifyingly strong assistant, and Su Youji herself was
actually an extremely talented individual as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had relied on
techniques she herself had come up with to reach the apex of the
Ancestral Immortal level. She had needed only one further step to
reach the World level, and after she joined Ning she had indeed
broken through to that level during their adventures within the
Allgod Estate! She had been improving at an incredibly fast rate.
Although she was inferior to Ning, she was still quite dazzling. Ning
naturally was willing to spend time and effort on helping build her
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
you want it as well?” Prince Greatjoy was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you
really are generous. We’re valuing these medallions at around a
million cubes each.” Firesurge chuckled as he picked up a Prismatic
Kiloleaf Flower. “I’ll simply choose this pretty little flower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no retainers.
I’ll choose one of the flowers as well.” Skyfire Brightshore also
choose to acquire one of the flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, if you
also want an Archaeus medallion, the answer is simple. Give me your
portion of the spoils and I’ll give you one of my medallions.”
Solewind smiled. “After the black-robed Daolord died, I found two
of the medallions on his corpse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
himself had a medallion, and he had kept another one of them stored
inside his storage treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “Thank you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for thanks.
I’m not giving it to you, I’m selling it to you for a million
cubes,” Solewind said. “Although I have quite a few retainers,
there is only one worth me spending time on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Solewind, and
Greatjoy each had a few retainers. Firesurge actually did as well,
but he didn’t feel any of them had that much potential and so he
wasn’t willing to spend much effort on them. As for Skyfire
Brightshore… he had originally been a lone wanderer before he was
abducted to the Birghtshore Kingdom. Even in the kingdom, he was a
lonely and solitary figure who had no retainers at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After splitting up the
loot, Ning’s group once more continued on their journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-world. Su Youji and World God Pillsaint, along with the other
World-level retainers, were sparring against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A pair of
dazzlingly beautiful wings of fire suddenly appeared behind Su Youji.
Light shone from her eyes, causing the muscular World God facing her
to grow rather dazed. An indecisive look of struggle appeared on his
face, and quite some time passed before he was able to come back to
his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamefairy’s
mastery over the arts of charm is growing more and more formidable.
I, Qiyang, am full of admiration for you.” The muscular World God
hurriedly spoke out in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were dazed long
enough for her to kill you a hundred times over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamefairy
really is incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
retainers were the ones who Ning had captured during his invasion of
their branch of the Bluegrace Sect. They all knew that Flamefairy Su
Youji had gained the legacy of Feixian the Exalted, and ever since
then she had only become more and more mesmerizing. The charm which
she naturally extruded was now so dazzling that weaker World-level
cultivators would be uncontrollably smitten by her. Even the stronger
cultivators would be dazed for a while then they saw her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that in a life-and-death battle, a single instant of befuddlement
which came at a critical moment could result in immediate death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the other
supreme World-level cultivators under Ning were a match for Su Youji
at all. This was how formidable a powerful legacy could be! But of
course, it was also partially due to the fact that Su Youji’s Dao
was quite a good match for the Dao of Feixian the Exalted, making it
easy for Su Youji to train in her skills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of her alluring
charm, all of these World-level cultivators couldn’t help but flock
around her. In fact, some of them secretly fantasized about one day
becoming Dao-companions with her. Alas, Su Youji was not interested
in them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” A voice
suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A look of
pleased surprise appeared on Su Youji’s face as she turned to look,
only to see a white-robed Ning appear off in the distance. This was a
divine power incarnation of Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The other
World-level retainers all called out respectfully as well, looks of
dread appearing on some of their faces. They had seen Ning attack
before, and they knew that he was only a completely different level
compared to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
Flamefairy immediately moved towards Ning, following right behind
him. Soon, the two moved into a copse of trees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A great opportunity
has come,” Ning said, looking at Su Youji. “If you can grasp it…
it could propel you to become a Samsara Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Samsara Daolord?”
Su Youjij was stunned. Although she had been improving rapidly in the
arts of charm, illusion, and control, she wasn’t even close to
becoming a Daolord just yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This opportunity is
something which people like us can only hope for, not count on.”
Ning waved his hand, causing a dark-red circular disc to within it.
“This is an Archaeus medallion. Bind it and carry it with you. If
you don’t keep it with you, you won’t be able to leave this
estate-world. If you tried, you would be crushed to death by the
power of the Archaeus region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Archaeus
medallion?” Although Su Youji was puzzled, she felt absolute faith
in Ji Ning. She obediently bound the Archaeus medallion, then took it
into her possession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had no idea what an
enormous opportunity this was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this alternate
universe or in their own universe, even the most talented of
geniuses, the ones who could become Samsara Daolords whenever they
chose, all dreamed of being able to acquire one of these medallions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Now follow
me out,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
had just become a group of eight! Ji Ning, Greatjoy, and Solewind had
each arranged for one retainer to join their group. They were Su
Youji the Flamefairy, World Goddess Skywolf, and Chaos Immortal
Swallowback.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World Goddess Skywolf
was the retainer of Prince Greatjoy. Although her Daoist title was
‘Skywolf’, she was actually an icy, grim woman of incredible
beauty who was surrounded by a strong aura of death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal
Swallowback was the retainer of Solewind and looked like a young
child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World Goddess Skywolf
and Chaos Immortal Swallowback had both reached extremely high levels
of insight into the Dao. Both of them could become Daolords whenever
they chose, and both were formal members of the Twelve Palaces!
Although they hadn’t been acknowledged by their respective pagodas,
they were still extraordinary figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was the
weakest of the eight, but just like Ning she had only been training
for a very brief period of time. She was also the personal disciple
of Feixian the Exalted and had tremendous potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the three
‘newcomers’ joined the squad of five, they all swore oaths not to
divulge any information regarding their own universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate-world within
the Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine power
incarnation descended upon this world, then turned to stare at the
muscular golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem stared at
Ning with its blazing eyes as it growled, “You killed Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Daolord
was its master. As soon as the Daolord had died, the golem had
regained its freedom. It naturally understand what this meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“Now… are you willing to submit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering golem
gritted its teeth, then knelt down and said respectfully, “Moksha
pays his respects to you, Master. Please don’t wipe out my mind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he
previously hadn’t been willing to submit was because he felt
certain that his master, the black-robed Daolord, would be able to
defeat Ji Ning and the others. Now, his original master had perished…
and this white-robed youth before him was unquestionably an
incredible genius who could easily become a Daolord in the future. By
then, the youth could use his Daolord-level energy to bind him by
force. In fact, if Ning was irritated enough he could wipe the
golem’s mind clean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anything which
possessed intelligence and sentience, be it a golem or a magic
treasure, would not wish for its mind to be wiped clean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
revealed a smile. Just like that, he had gained an obedient golem
that was the equal of a Daolord of the Third Step.

Chapter 18 – The Genesis Lands
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moksha acted very
obediently, actively assisting Ji Ning in binding him. Ning couldn’t
help but secretly sigh to himself. He certainly changed his attitude
quite quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been first
captured, he had been boastful and held Ning in no regard at all,
feeling certain that Ning’s group was going to die soon. Now that
he realized that his former master had died, he had immediately knelt
down and begged, ‘Please do not kill me.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” After
being bound, Moksha immediately smiled ingratiatingly at Ning. “There
is something I must tell you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was instructed by
Emperor Trisilk to assist my master in mining ore,” Moksha said
smugly. “Darkspace flamestone is extremely difficult to mine, but I
am extremely strong. Over the course of thirty chaos cycles, I
managed to mine quite a bit of ore. For convenience’s sake, I
stored it all within an estate-treasure which I carried with me as I
mined.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
“Do you still have the darkspace flamestone?” He had been mining
for thirty chaos cycles. How much had he mined?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Moksha
nodded. “However, a good deal of it was taken away by my previous
master. I only have on me the ore which I mined in the last nine
chaos cycles. Take a look, Master.” As Moksha spoke, he waved his
hand and caused fist-sized chunks of fiery-red rocks to appear on the
ground. Strange spatial ripples began to fill the surrounding area as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waved his hand three
times in total, causing the fiery-red rocks to pile up into a small
mountain that was three thousand meters tall. By this point in time,
space had begun to completely twist and distort, causing shimmering
‘curtains’ of folded space to appear in the surrounding area.
Because the chunks of stone were all fist-sized, it wasn’t too hard
to store them away in that estate-treasure. If this had been a single
massive slab of darkspace flamestone, most likely only an Eternal
Emperor would’ve been able to store it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You mined that
much?” Ning’s eyes nearly popped out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although golems that
were as strong as Daolords of the Third Step were valuable, the
amount of ore this particular golem was carrying was even more
valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So much darkspace
flamestone…” Ning swept it with his godsense, carefully
calculating how much was present. “This has to be worth nearly ten
million cubes of chaos nectar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My former master had
roughly twice as much as this,” Moksha said. “Early on, I wasn’t
that skilled in using axes and so was rather slow in my mining. It
took about twenty chaos cycles before I got better, and all of the
ore I mined during that period of time I gave to my previous master.
This pile here consists of the ore I mined during the past nine chaos
cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m more than
satisfied with this.” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ore had to be
worth nearly ten million cubes of chaos nectar. As for the twenty
million cubes which the black-robed Daolord had, that all belonged to
Solewind. In order to save them, Solewind had used up a powerful
Dao-seal that was so valuable, it would be almost impossible to find
on the open market. Ning naturally didn’t feel any jealousy or envy
whatsoever. For him to suddenly earn so much darkspace flamestone was
already a stroke of tremendous fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you know
about Emperor Trisilk?” Ning asked. The five of them still felt
worried about this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Trisilk has
an odd temper and is incredibly savage,” Moksha said. “You must
be careful, Master. Based on what I know of the Emperor, he’s the
type to avenge every single slight, no matter how petty. Once he
locates the five of you… I guarantee he won’t let you off
easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” A solemn look
appeared on Ning’s face as he nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the two
of them had no idea that Emperor Trisilk was currently in a far more
miserable situation than they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the
Genesis Lands? What do you know about that place?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Genesis Lands is
where this entire universe sprang from. All combat is forbidden
there,” Moksha said. “When I served the Emperor, I once spent a
very long period of time in the Genesis Lands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, “Who
issued the order forbidding all combat in that location?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The order came from
the Church of Annihilation,” Moksha said. “Daolords generally do
not dare to violate the commands of the Church. But of course, if
someone really does go crazy, they can still choose to break this
law. I once saw it happen with my own eyes. A Daolord, for the sake
of evading an enemy, chose to hide within the Genesis Lands. However,
his enemy was so enraged that he ignored the rules and chased the
Daolord into the Genesis Lands, then killed him there! But of course…
later on, the killer was wiped out by the Church of Annihilation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still… the
Paladins of the Church of Annihilation aren’t afraid to violate
this law. They are members of the Church itself, after all. Even when
they break this law, they will at most suffer some non-lethal
punishments,” Moksha said. “I once heard Master say that if the
sixteen Starkings were to violate this law, no punishment would be
given. Not even the ruler of the Church of Annihilation would choose
to offend and act against his Starkings without a very good reason.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning
chuckled. This golem knew quite a bit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the almighty
Hegemon had given them some information regarding this alternate
universe before sending them into it, but the amount of information
was pitifully small. All Ning knew was that the Archaeus region was
filled with danger, but once they reached the Genesis Lands in the
center they would be fairly safe. Although the Genesis Lands held its
own dangers, all violence was supposedly prohibited there.
Supposedly, there was no need to worry about any World-level
cultivators or Daolords you encountered within the Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the golem
speak at length, Ning couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ‘prohibition’
against violence?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, there was a
limit to how far that prohibition would stretch. Suicidally fearless
cultivators would violate that prohibition, as would the Paladins and
Starkings of the Church of Annihilation, thanks to the extremely high
positions they held within the Church.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still… Paladins
will be punished if they violate this prohibition. They won’t
attack us without a good reason.” Ning nodded slowly. “As for
Starkings… I imagine we aren’t even qualified to attract the
attention of a Starking, much less offend one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our entire universe
only holds sixteen Starkings, and almost none of them are in the
Archaeus region,” Moksha said. “I heard Emperor Trisilk once say
that even he himself has only met three Starkings in his lifetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moksha had been Emperor
Trisilk’s golem for quite some time, and thus knew many of the
Emperor’s secrets. He had even been in the Genesis Lands, and thus
he was able to give Ning a good deal of information regarding that
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on,
and Ning’s group of eight continued their careful advance. The rest
of their journey was fairly uneventful, and they did not encounter
any more Daolords! In truth, the odds of encountering a Daolord in
the Archaeus region were incredibly low to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, they had spent
over 8922 years in the Archaeus region, and they had encountered many
dangerous situations and locales. Still, in the end they were able to
safely reach the Genesis Lands. All eight of them survived this
journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Genesis Lands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel was
soaring through the emptiness of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the eight were aboard the vessel, and their heads were raised as they
stared at an utterly enormous floating world which was in front of
them. This was the Genesis Lands! This was the wellspring of this
entire alternate universe, from which all things originally arose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That aura of power…”
Ning and the others were all quite shaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible field of
power covered the entire Archaeus region. Without an Archaeus
medallion, even the likes of Eternal Emperors would be instantly
crushed to death! The Archaeus region was almost as large as their
homeland, the ‘Endless Territories’. It was incredibly vast, and
that field of power stretched out to cover every inch of the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet… the
incredibly vast world in front of them was the source of that field
of power. One could imagine how much might it contained! Not even
someone as powerful as the almighty Hegemon could compare to the
might of the Genesis Lands of the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let us enter
the Genesis Lands,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
you told us earlier that the elementary trial we need to pass in
order to enter the Genesis Lands is a trial of resolve, correct?”
Greatjoy asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is what my
golem told me. I think he was telling the truth,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not just anyone was
permitted to enter the Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For weaker cultivators,
entering the Genesis Lands was an almost impossible task. Any
creature which sought to enter the Genesis Lands would first have to
pass a trial of resolve. If they were able to endure it, they would
be able to freely enter and wander the Genesis Lands. If they failed,
they would be knocked unconscious and be teleported away. They would
not be qualified to enter this sacred place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The trial isn’t
that tough. Daolords and major schools often send their elite
disciples to this place. Almost all of the more talented ones are
able to gain entry.” Ning could tell that Su Youji, Chaos Immortal
Swallowback, and World Goddess Skywolf all looked rather nervous. The
three of them were just retainers, after all. Compared to the
original five, they were still quite a bit weaker. As a result, they
possessed less confidence in their own abilities as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Flamefairy nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
advanced at high speeds, flying towards that utterly massive
levitating world. Finally, it began to slow down as it drew closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A web of venerable,
almost sacred power descended from on high, covering Ning and the
other eight within its grasp. This web of power was grim and
unfeeling, and it possessed no intelligence whatsoever. It was a type
of power which the Genesis Lands itself naturally possessed. This
place was the Genseis Lands. It was not a place for weak creatures to
live in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel
something furiously hammer at his soul. However, Ning’s soul had
been nurtured and strengthened by his azureflower mist energy, making
it comparable to the soul of a Daolord of the First Step. He was able
to resist the pressure with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to glance
at the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy,
Solewind, and Firesurge all seemed to be handling the trial with
ease, and they all glanced back at him as well, smiles on their
faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
others all noticed at the same time that Skyfire Brightshore had an
ugly look on his face, and his body was trembling slightly. Although
he was blessed with incredible natural gifts and had an extraordinary
bloodline, he had experienced very few dangerous encounters in his
early life. As a result, his soul and his willpower were all somewhat
lacking when compared to that of Ning and the others.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 19 – Universe Treasure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
three began to grow nervous. The entire point of this journey was for
them to accompany Skyfire Brightshore in an adventure within the
Archaeus region. The journey wasn’t going to come to a crashing
halt because this Brightshore Imperial wasn’t even able to enter
the Genesis Lands, right? That would be an absolute joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” Ning turned
to glance at the other three retainers. Chaos Immortal Swallowback,
World Goddess Skywolf, and Flamefairy Su Youji all had fairly relaxed
looks on their faces. It seemed as though Swallowback was the most
relaxed; he even grinned at Ning and the others. Skywolf and Su
Youji, the two women, had fairly unpleasant l ooks on their faces,
and their bodies were shaking slightly. Still, it seemed as though
they would be able to endure it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long period of time
passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That exalted web of
power continued to fill every inch of this world, but it no longer
launched any attacks against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Skyfire
Brightshore let out a sigh of relief, and World Goddess Skywolf and
Su Youji all looked slightly more relaxed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was
embarrassing. I was damn near flattened.” Skyfire Brightshore shook
his head and laughed. He was born at the World God level of power,
and he had been a solitary figure for much of his early life. In
fact, shortly after he was born he had been abducted by the almighty
Hegemon. As a result, his soul and his willpower were both very weak
compared to that of the other five. The only reason he had been able
to survive this trial was because of his innate gifts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single member of
his race was blessed with extraordinary powers from birth. His soul
was already as strong as that of a Daolord’s, and so although he
possessed much weaker willpower than Ning and the others, he was
still able to endure the trial and overcome in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All eight of us will
be granted entry. This is something to celebrate.” Prince Greatjoy
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.” Ning
glanced at Su Youji and offered her a few words of praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I feel
fortunate that I’ve spent these past few years meditating on the
techniques of my master, Feixian the Exalted, within your
estate-world. I’ve improved quite a bit with regards to my
willpower and my mental strength. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been
able to survive that,” Su Youji sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Su Youji’s
path was a path of charm and control. This was naturally a path that
required an extremely powerful mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel flew
deeper into the world of the Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world of
truly incredible proportions. It was trillions of kilometers in size,
and it seemed almost endless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How vast.” Su
Youji sighed in amazement as she stared at the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the place
which gave birth to this entire universe.” Ning stared at their
surroundings as well. He could sense that certain locations within
this world were filled with auras of incredible power that only
strengthened as they flew closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look over
there!” Prince Greatjoy pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning and the
others looked towards the direction in which he was pointing, only to
see a powerful expert seated in the lotus position atop a golden
carpet. This expert had a single horn on his head and was covered
with dark-red scales, while the golden carpet was covered with many
delicacies and wine. The man was drinking wine and devouring his food
while casually glancing at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey there, kiddos!”
The horned expert suddenly noticed Ning’s group, and he immediately
called out to them while flying towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group didn’t
try to avoid him, as they knew that all combat was forbidden within
the Genesis Lands. Many of the disciples of the mightiest major
powers of this alternate universe had all gathered here within this
place! It might be rare for them to encounter their peers in the
other parts of the Archaeus region, but that was because they were
all gathered here within the Genesis Lands. There were quite a few
Daolords in seclusion here as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, the
Genesis Lands held many Daolords as well as quite a few World-level
cultivators. If it wasn’t for the law against combat, the
World-level cultivators would’ve been wiped out long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“New arrivals?” The
horned expert grinned merrily as he landed aboard their flying
vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
Ning and the others bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Able to enter the
Genesis Lands despite merely being at the World level. Not bad at
all!” The horned expert grinned as he praised them. “I was only
able to come to this place after I became a Daolord. Come, come!
Bring me your finest wine and your best food and let me have a taste.
In exchange, I, Owlbath, shall impart unto you some of the rules and
secrets regarding the Genesis Lands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please be welcome,
senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please have a taste,
senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
hurriedly took out all sorts of fine food and wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad at all.
Glug, glug. Hey, this wine is pretty good too. Can I have some more?”
The horned expert didn’t just eat and drink, he even stashed some
of the food away for later without seeming to feel the slightest bit
embarrassed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned expert
burped, then chortled merrily with half-lidded eyes. “Don’t
worry, I’m not going to eat all of your food for nothing. The
Genesis Lands is an enormous place. If you just run around randomly,
you may very well end up dying here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
listened silently, the very picture of innocent obedience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Genesis Lands
can be roughly divided into two parts; the ‘outer reaches’ and
the ‘inner reaches’. The true name of the ‘inner region’ is
actually the Prime Reaches, and it holds the innermost core and prime
essences of this entire universe. There are many deceased ancient
powers located within the Prime Reaches, and it is the most important
location in our entire universe.” The horned expert said casually,
“Every single cultivator would dream of being able to enter the
Prime Reaches of the Genseis Lands. The Prime Reaches are located at
the very center, and you’ll be able to recognize it as soon as you
see it.” Glug, glug, glug. He raised his head and drank several
more mouthfuls of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded. Actually, they knew all of this already! Moksha the golem had
told Ning long ago about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single
World-level cultivator capable of entering the Genesis Lands is a
genius,” the horned expert said. “But perhaps just one in a
hundred of them are capable of entering the inner reaches!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were stunned. Just one in a hundred? This was their first time
hearing this number. Generally speaking, the World-level cultivators
who were able to enter this place were all capable of becoming
Daolords whenever they chose! Who would’ve thought that entering
the inner reaches would be this difficult?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the outer
reaches aren’t a bad place to be either. The outer reaches were
formed when the universe itself was born, and it contains many
mysterious places and many hidden fortunes,” the horned expert
said. “I myself stay out here in the outer reaches. Alas… while
one in a hundred World-level cultivators are able to enter the inner
reaches, things are much worse for us Daolords. Perhaps just one in
ten thousand Daolords are able to enter the inner reaches!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The outer reaches
are filled with treasures, but the inner reaches are absolutely
incredible. Almost all of the Eternal Emperors will venture into the
inner reaches in search of treasures.” A mysterious look suddenly
flashed through the horned expert’s eyes. “Have you heard?
Shortly after the master of the Church of Annihilation became an
Eternal Emperor, he entered the inner reaches… and then, for some
reason, he became terrifyingly strong, strong enough to unify our
entire universe and force all the major powers in it to submit to
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and the
others were growing increasingly curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all the Eternal
Emperors would enter the place? It was the Prime Reaches which gave
the master of the Church of Annihilation his incredible power,
allowing him to unify this universe?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone says that
the Prime Reaches are filled with endless possibilities. Just three
chaos cycles ago, a Daolord managed to acquire a Universe treasure
within the Prime Reaches,” the horned expert said in a mysterious
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Universe
treasure?” Solewind and Skyfire were both shocked. As for Greatjoy
and Ning, they revealed puzzled looks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What exactly was a
Universe treasure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this, the
horned expert grinned. “It seems as though some of you, my young
friends, haven’t heard this phrase before. Actually, even I only
heard of these treasures after entering the Genesis Lands. Eternal
treasures are powerful, but above them… there is a legendary rank
of supremely powerful treasures which are known as Universe
treasures. They are often also referred to as Supreme treasures.
These are truly incredible treasures which even Eternal Emperors
would go wild over. They are incredibly powerful, and they are
incredibly mysterious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” The horned
expert shook his head. “Universe treasures are truly supreme
treasures; there’s no way you can bind them by force! You can only
bind a Universe treasure if the treasure itself acknowledges you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Greatjoy, and the
others were all rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment,
Heartlord Solewind sent mentally to them, “Darknorth, Greatjoy,
Firesurge… Universe treasures are legendary things that are filled
with inconceivable amounts of power. They truly are the most supreme
eof treasures, and they are both incredibly rare and incredibly
valuable. Even Eternal Emperors would drool over the chance to
acquire such treasures! Treasures like them can only be hoped for,
not actively sought out. Right… Darknorth, your Sword Palace
actually holds a Universe treasure known as the ‘Shardsword’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shardsword?” Ning
was stunned. He remembered now; the first time he entered the Sword
Palace, when he entered the Armaments Gorge he had encountered a
‘broken’ shard of a sword that had no price tag and which he
couldn’t even move towards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still remembered
how he had asked the overseers of the Armaments Groge, Swordfive and
Swordsix, about that strange sword. Their response had been to tell
them that it was clear the sword and Ning were not fated to be
together, and that even the two previous Palace Lords of the Sword
Palace had not been able to receive the acknowledgment of that sword.
Ever since the Shardsword’s original owner had died, the Shardsword
had been silent and accepted no others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that ‘broken’
sword was actually a Universe treasure. No wonder not even the two
Palace Lords of the Sword Palace were able to receive its
acknowledgment,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, are there
Universe treasures within the Prime Reaches?” Solewind couldn’t
help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are.” But
the horned expert then shook his head. “According to the history
books, over the course of countless years there has been a total of
eight Universe treasures who acknowledged the major powers who found
them and were willing to follow them out of the Genesis Lands!
Supposedly, even more Universe treasures are hidden within the Prime
Reaches. To be honest, though… Universe treasures don’t really
matter that much. The thing which really drives all the cultivators
crazy is the mystery behind the process by which the master of the
Church of Annihilation gained such incredible power… but of course,
those are the affairs of the most supreme cultivators of our
universe. You World-level cultivators don’t need to worry too much
about those matters. You aren’t strong enough to get involved just
yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still. The Prime
Reaches truly are a mysterious place. I’ve never been there before
myself, and I imagine none of the eight of you will be able to enter
either,” the horned expert said.

Chapter 20 – Emperor Maniseal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you
will probably stay in the outer reaches as well,” the horned
cultivator said. “I’ll tell you a bit about some of the taboos in
the outer reaches. The danger in the outer reaches primarily comes
from certain mysterious locations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned expert began
to introduce various things they had to look out for as well as
describe some of the more famous danger zones. Generally speaking,
the places with the most opportunities were also the places with the
most danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His narration went on
for two full hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, let’s speak
of cultivators,” the horned expert said. “In the outer reaches,
there are many Daolords who reside in seclusion, as well as quite a
few World-level cultivators like yourselves who are seeking great
fortunes. There’s no need for you to worry too much about these
people, so long as you avoid offending the most powerful Daolords.
Generally speaking, no one will dare to attack in this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ones you really
need to look out for are the two Eternal Emperors who live in
seclusion in the outer reaches,” the horned expert said. “If you
irritate them, you’ll be in serious trouble. Even if they kill you,
at most they will be given some light punishment by the Church of
Annihilation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the two
Eternal Emperors is named Emperor Northtree,” the horned expert
said. “The other is named Emperor Maniseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Northtree
isn’t that worrisome. He probably won’t attack for no reason.
Emperor Maniseal, though… you really don’t want to piss him off.”
A look of worry could be seen in the horned expert’s eyes. “These
days, Emperor Maniseal might start a massacre at the drop of a hat,
and even if he did the Church of Annihilation wouldn’t really do
anything to him. I’ve heard that even the master of the church is
trying to befriend him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Befriend him?”
Ning and the others were puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Maniseal
used to be a very low-key Eternal Emperor, but that arrogant madman
Emperor Trislk killed his beloved disciple. This truly enraged him…
eheh.” The horned expert shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Greatjoy,
Solewind, Firesurge, and Skyfire felt their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Trisilk? They
had been worrying about him attacking them for quite some time now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enraged, Emperor
Maniseal began to chase after and hunt down Empero rTrisilk.” The
horned expert sighed in true amazement. “The power he displayed was
enough to shock everyone in this universe. He was far more powerful
than most Eternal Emperors, while Emperor Trisilk had a terrible
reputation and had offended many major powers but had been able to
survive due to his top-notch survival skills. And yet… Emperor
Maniseal has been chasing after him relentlessly, forcing him to flee
nonstop. Emperor Trisilk no longer dares to show his face anywhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
secretly let out sighs of relief. Wonderful. Well done! The more
difficult Emperor Trisilk’s straits were, the safer they would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Maniseal is
most skilled in the Dao of Seals,” the horned expert is. Right now,
a Dao-seal clone of his currently lives within the outer reaches.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao-seal clone?”
Ning and the others were puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A clone created from
a single Dao-seal,” the horned expert said. “Supposedly, it has
80% of the power of his true body! And he has nine of these Dao-seal
clones!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘What?!” Ning and
the others could hardly believe it. How could Dao-seal clones be this
strong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the likes of Daolord Badlands or Daolord Solesky had to spend
enormous amounts of treasure and effort in order to create a powerful
avatar, and they could only really have one at a time! This was true
in both the Endless Territories and in this universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-seal clones
which Emperor Maniseal had created were simply ridiculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a special
secret art which only he possesses and only he can use. Not even his
disciples have been taught this technique,” the horned expert said.
“It is probably a secret art he came up with after he became an
Eternal Empror. He’s reached an unfathomably deep level of skill in
his Dao of Seals, and has been publicly acknowledged as the number
one master of this Dao in the Church of Annihilation! It is precisely
due to his unfathomable mastery of this Dao that the master of the
Church of Annihilation supposedly wants to befriend him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s currently
boiling with rage and the desire to kill right now, and the leaders
of the Church of Annihilation are all trying to befriend him. Thus…
even if he does kill a few World-level cultivators, no one will be
willing to offend him over it.” The horned expert pointed off into
the distance. “Look. That place over there? The tallest peak on
that levitating mountain? That’s where one of his Dao-seal bodies
currently resides.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
turned to stare. Roughly ten billion kilometers away from them, there
was indeed a levitating ountain peak that emanated ripples of
tremendous power. Ning and the others all felt reverence towards this
man. He had reached such a level of skill in his craft that he was
acknowledged as being the ultimate expert in this entire universe in
the Dao of Seals. Most likely, the reason he had been such a low-key
figure in the past was precisely because he was completely focused on
analyzing Dao-seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
felt gratitude towards him. His pursuit of Emperor Trisilk ensured
that they would have nothing more to worry about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a floating
mountain. Inside an ordinary estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Maniseal was
dressed in deep blue Daoist robes and wore a crown on his head. His
face was thin and long, while his eyes were quite narrow. He loked
very unpleasant right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth was kneeling
before him. “Master, I went to beg the White Emperor for
assistance. The White Emperor said that if you were willing to hand
over eight of your ‘Lifeblood’ Dao-seals, he would guarantee that
he would be able to convince the master of the Church of Annihilation
to bring our second apprentice-brother back to life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight Lifeblood
Dao-seals? Hmph. These two… ugh.” Emperor Maniseal might have
been a good-tempered man, but he was quaking with rage right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most highly ranked
members in the Church of Annihilation were its master and the sixteen
Starkings, but there were differences amongst the Starkings as well.
Of the sixteen, there were three known as the Primal Starkings who
were very special. Supposedly, they had existed ever since this
universe had been created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White Emperor was
one of the three Primal Starkings, and was the teacher of the leader
of the Church of Annihilation! However, the leader of the Church of
Annihilation had eventually become the most powerful figure in the
entire universe, overtaking his master and unifying this entire
universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader of the
Church of Annihilation asked for nine Lifeblood Dao-seals to revive
my disciple. As for his master, he asked for just a bit less; ‘just’
eight!” Emperor Maniseal ground his teeth. “These two must have
come to a private agreement to rob me blind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lifeblood Dao-seals
represented the highest level of expertise which Emperor Maniseal had
reached in the Dao of Seals. They possessed inconceivable amounts of
power. If you were slain by a foe, you could rely on it to instantly
come back to life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single Lifeblood
Dao-seal represented an extra life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of
countless years, Emperor Maniseal had used up many treasures via many
failed attempts to create these Dao-seals. After all that, he had
still created just two of those Lifeblood Dao-seals. Even someone
like him, the inventor of these Dao-seals, had a very high chance of
failure when creating them. The creation process was simply far too
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had asked the master
of the Church of Annihilation to reverse the flow of spacetime and
revive his beloved disciple. He had loved his second disciple as he
would a son. He was willing to pay any price!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the leader of the
Church of Annihilation had rejected him outright. “Reverse the
flows of spacetime and revive a Verge-level Daolord? Impossible. I’ve
never even revived one of my retainers or disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been a clear-cut
refusal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Emperor
Maniseal had brought out a half-finished version of his Lifeblood
Dao-seal. The leader of the Church had been stunned upon seeing it!
Given his exalted status, he immediately recognized how valuable this
seal was. He immediately changed his tone. “Given how strong I am,
only some of the most ancient powers in other universes might pose a
threat ot me. If you can give me nine of these Lifeblood Dao-seals,
I’ll be willing to bear the price necessary to reverse spacetime
and save your disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not only did the
creation of these Lifeblood Dao-seals require an enormous amount of
treasure, they also took at least three full chaos cycles of time!
And… once you made a single mistake, all of the time and wealth you
had spent would have gone to waste! Worst of all, creating these
Dao-seals required tremendous focus and was extremely tiresome. To
stay in such a state for three full chaos cycle, with the results
generally being failure… this was just a staggeringly exhausting
process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been countless
years since he had come up with this idea, but he had only been able
to create two of these seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Lifeblood
Dao-seals are equivalent to an extra life. Hmph. The leader of the
Church truly is greedy.” Emperor Maniseal ground his teeth. “Let’s
wait and see. Sooner or later, he’ll seek me out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Maniseal felt
that his Dao-seals were too difficult to create.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the leader of
the Church, the leader similarly felt that reversing spacetime to
revive a Verge-level Daolord was far too difficult. As for simply
killing Emperor Maniseal? That never even came up as a possibility,
as the Lifeblood Dao-seal meant that Emperor Maniseal was ost likely
the toughest person to kill in this universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
continued to advance. As for Daolord Owlbat, he continued to eat,
drink, and boast. Ning’s group simply listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any art, when
improved to the ultimate level, will possess inconceivable power.
Emperor Maniseal has reached incredible heights in the Dao of Seals,”
Daolord Owlbath said. “I heard that of the sixteen Starkings, the
White Emperor has reached such heights in the Dao of Metal that you
can’t even comprehend it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were happy to hear him talk on and on, and the flying vessel
continued to teleport forwards and advance towards the center of the
Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“See that?” Daolord
Owlbath pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were stunned by what they saw. An incredibly terrifying abyss was in
the earth in front of them, and above that abyss hovered a world that
was roughly a billion kilometers in size. This world radiated a
towering pillar of light that was filled with countless terrifying
auras, many of which were comparable to the auras of Eternal
Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many chains were
attached to that levitating world, and the chains themselves were
rooted firmly into the land of the outer reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That right there is
the inner reaches! The world which gave birth to the entire universe,
and which holds all of its prime essences,” Daolord Owlbath said.
“There are eight primessence chains which connect it to the outer
reaches. What you need to do is walk onto those chains and stride
into the inner reaches.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course… if
you aren’t careful and end up falling into that abyss? Even
Daolords of the Fourth Step will be devoured and killed by the abyss,
to say nothing of the likes of you!” Daolord Owlbath said.

Chapter 21 – The Chains
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel flew
towards one of the primessence chains. There were twelve World-level
cultivators seated there in the lotus position. Clearly, they also
wished to attempt to pass the primessence chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flying
vessel landed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight more have
joined the fray.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looks like we’re
making new friends.” The other twelve World-level cultivators who
were already present grinned as they got up and moved forward to
welcome Ji Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuzhou greets you,
fellow Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Warpflame greets
you, fellow Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators all came over to greet htem, and Ning’s group exchanged
a few words of pleasantries with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite common for
people in the Genesis Lands to chat up unfamiliar faces, as all
World-level cultivators who were able to make it into the Genesis
Lands of this universe were extraordinary figures with limitless
future prospects! In addition, all violence was forbidden here,
making it so that they didn’t have to worry about ambushes or sneak
attacks. This encouraged people to befriend each other, as perhaps
one of these new friends might one day become an unearthly Daolord or
perhaps even an Eternal Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and his group all
introduced themselves, making just slight alterations to their true
story.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists, why
haven’t you passed through these chains and entered the Prime
Reaches?” Solewind laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think we don’t
want to? It’s that we aren’t able to.” A withered-looking
World-level cultivator immediately shook his head. “The only way to
enter the inner reaches from the outer reaches is by passing through
one of those primessence chains. If you try to fly over, you’ll be
swallowed up and devoured by the abyss. However, the chains
themselves are also quite dangerous. There are special trials for
World-level cultivators, and even more difficult trials for Samsara
Daolords. Both trials are extremely dangerous, and the closer you get
to the inner reaches the more dangerous it shall become.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and the
other seven were quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, I forgot to tell
you!” Daolord Owlbath was still seated next to them, drinking some
wine. He let out a laugh and said, “When you step onto the
primessence chains, there will be some wraiths that will begin to
attack you. The farther along you go, the more powerful and numerous
the wraiths shall be. Right… the primessence chains themselves are
also capable of affecting your mind. If you aren’t careful, you
might go crazy. If that happens, you’ll be dead for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just so. This senior
speaks the truth. Thus… fellow Daoists, once you attempt to
traverse the primessence chains, you need to immediately retreat as
soon as you feel as though you’ve reached your limit. If you
retreat, you’ll still alive. If you try to force your way through,
you’ll probably encounter a sudden danger that you can’t handle
which will knock you off the chains. The abyss will swallow you, and
your truesoul will be wiped out. You’ll definitely die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Better to retreat
than to try and force things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve all
expressed similar sentiments, trying to dissuade the newcomers from
rashness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Owlbath nodded
as well. “If you move slowly and carefully gauge your chances,
you’ll have a shot of staying alive. If you try to force things,
you’ll be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
everyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We understand.”
Ning and the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group
exchanged a round of glances. It seemed they absolutely could not
underestimate the deadliness of these primessence chains. Every
World-level cultivator able to reach the Genesis Lands was a figure
of extraordinary ability, but less than one in a hundred were able to
enter the Prime Reaches. The difficulty of this trial spoke for
itself. If you overestimated yourself, you would probably die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll give it a
shot first. The three of you should wait for now,” Solewind sent
mentally. “Greatjoy, Darknorth, Firesurge, Skyfire… I recommend
you let me be the first to give it at try. They said that these
primessence chains can affect one’s mind, and I feel quite
confident in my abilities in this area. As for those so-called
wraiths… I’ll definitely move slowly and cautiously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning,
Greatjoy, and the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Less than one in a
hundred World-level cultivators were able to succeed, but Heartlord
Solewind was a Heartforce Cultivator who had been acknowledged by the
ancient pagodas of the Palace of the Heart. He definitely stood far
above the vast majority of cultivators with regards to the power of
his mind and heart. Even proud figures like Ning and Greatjoy knew
that they were significantly inferior to Solewind in this respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve World-level
cultivators, Daolord Owlbath, and the other seven all watched as
Heartlord Solewind advanced onto the primessence chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primessence chains
were a thousand kilometers long and fifteen meters wide. Although
they were described as ‘chains’, they were really more like
bridges! Still, people like Ning could stably traverse even a
minisculy thin steel wire without swaying in the slightest, to say
nothing of a bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Solewind advanced
through the enormous steel chains, he couldn’t help but frown and
say, “Everyone, these chains truly are rather bizarre. Make sure
you don’t let your mind and heart be swayed by it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRAAAH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRAAAH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two illusory figures
suddenly swooped up from the infinitely deep abyss of darkness below
the chains. The two moved incredibly fast, traversing a thousand
kilometers in a single flicker as they charged towards Heartlord
Solewind. One phantom was of a grim-faced man who wielded a warblade,
while the other was of an ugly alien creature who wielded nine whips
in its nine arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind’s gaze grew
cold as he saw those two phantoms strike towards him. A series of
magic treasures that looked like fiery lotuses began to bloom behind
him, and as they bloomed they immediately began to transform into
blazing firebirds. There was a total of 391 firebirds in the skies,
and they all radiated with blazing auras that easily dissipated the
attacks coming from those two phantoms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
frowned upon seeing this. Were these the ‘wraiths’? Why did they
seem like cultivators?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are all
cultivators who died long, long ago.” Daolord Owlbath explained,
“After they died their truesouls were destroyed, but their power
was transformed into these strange wraiths. Because you are at the
World level, World-level wraiths shall be sent to attack you. If a
Daolord attempted to pass… things would be far more frightening.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many of them failed
while attempting to pass through the primessence chains, and some of
them were truly dazzling figures of their time. Later on, these
wraiths will group together and attack en masse.” Daolord Owlbath
sighed. “To go through the primessence chains and reach the Prime
Reaches. Oh, that’s gonna be tough, tough, tough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
continuously advanced while controlling his magic treasures, using it
to break apart all impediments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
primessence chains themselves were trembling slightly, sending out
multiple strange ripples of power. Ning was able to physically see
those ripples emanating out, each expanding to become thirty meters
in size. Heartlord Solewind had to rely on the power of the chains to
fight back against the devouring power of the abyss, but by doing so
he ended up being restricted by the power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
advanced with cool calmness, using his magic treasures to slaughter
all of the attacking wraiths. As he continued to advance, more and
more wraiths of increasingly greater power began to charge out of the
abyss below the Prime Reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Heartforce
Cultivator, he was naturally quite skilled in controlling magic
treasures from afar. These wraiths, as of right now, were not able to
force him into close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five hundred
kilometers. He’s made it pretty far, pretty fast.” Daolord
Owlbath stared in boggled amazement. “This young fellow is way too
powerful, and he has an incredibly strong mind and heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t even
swaying a bit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s completely
ignoring the effects of the primessence chains?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve World-level
cultivators who had already tried and failed in the past also stared
in amazement. The mental influence of the primessence chains would
grow increasingly strong, and at five hundred kilometers the
influence was now incredibly strong. Generally speaking, even those
who were able to endure the mental attacks would feel quite
miserable. Heartlord Solewind, however, had an extremely calm look on
his face. He looked as though he was simply strolling through the
streets. He made it look easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
revealed smiles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only one in a
hundred can succeed? Hmph. Let them compete with us,” Prince
Greatjoy sent to Ning and the others in an extremely smug manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Solewind is
making it look easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning and the
others weren’t the arrogant type, they agreed with what Greatjoy
said. In terms of all-around ability, the five of them truly did
surpass the vast majority of the other World-level cultivators in the
Genesis Lands. These were the most elite geniuses of the geniuses of
the Brightshore Kingdom, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
continued to advance. Six hundred kilometers. Seven hundred. Eight.
Nine…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Owlbath and the
others watched with slack jaws as this happened. Howevere, towards
the end Heartlord Solewind was also forced into close combat, and a
look of seriousness appeared on his face for the first time as his
movements noticeably slowed down. Still, he gritted his teeth and
continued to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Over a thousand
wraiths were attacking him now. Heartlord Solewind fought his way
through them, then reached the end of this primessence chain and
entered the Prime Reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
brother Solewind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll join you in
a bit, Solewind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatjoy, Ning,
Skyfire, and Firesurge were in superb moods. For the first person
from their side to challenge this trial and succeed naturally pleased
them greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He succeeded, just
like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Owlbath and the
others couldn’t even believe it. Passing through the primessence
chains was supposed to be incredibly difficult, right? But just now,
that bald red-robed kid seemed to have breezed right through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, Greatjoy,
Skyfire, Firesurge.” Solewind stood at the other end of the chains,
staring at them from afar as he called out loudly, “The mental
influence of the primessence chains is terrifingly strong, far more
so than the attacks of the wraiths. You must be careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood!” Ning
and the others grinned back at him in response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which of the three
of us shall be the next to give it a try?” Greatjoy turned his gaze
towards Ning and Firesurge.
</P>

Chapter 22 – Heaven’s Moat
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to what
JiNing and the others had planned, the four ‘protectors’ would
first make their attempts, followed by Skyfire Brightshore. Only then
would the retainers Su Youji, World Goddess Skywolf, and Chaos
Immortal Swallowback make their attempts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go next. I’m
still quite confident in my chances.” Firesurge revealed a smile.
Because he had a cold and forbidding aura to begin with, his smile
looked rather sinister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
Greatjoy nodded, then watched as Firesurge walked over towards the
chains, then stepped onto them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gazes of Ji Ning,
Greatjoy, Skyfire, the retainers, Daolord Owlbath, and the twelve
other World-level cultivators were all focused on this youth dressed
in deep blue robes as he advanced through the chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prime Reaches. I
have to enter them.” A terrifying, baleful aura could be seen in
Firesurge’s eyes. “Nothing and no one will stop me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge’s path of
cultivation had been a path filled with many setbacks and pitfalls.
When he had been a weak mortal cultivator, he had lived in a world
that had been controlled by ten mighty demonic sects! The demonic
sects were filled with guile, treachery, and internecine murder.
Every single powerful expert rose to power by trampling across the
corpses of others… and Firesurge became the most powerful
cultivator of this entire mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had continued his
path without remorse, eventually entering the greater primordial
chaos and then being recruited into the Palace of Kindwater of the
Twelve Palaces of Brightshore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, he had been
given the chance to join Ning and the others and adventure through
the Genesis Lands of this Archaeus region in this alternate universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had to use every
scrap of power I had, but was just barely able to claw my way into
fourth place.” Firesurge strode forwards as waves buffeted the area
around him. “Solewind, Greatjoy, Darknorth… all three of them are
somewhat stronger than me, to say nothing of the most dazzling
figures of the Brightshore Kingdom, Bertulu and Eastcult!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to
surpass them. I’m going to surpass all cultivators!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge felt a
certain degree of urgency in this regard. Prince Greatjoy was the
strongest of the four, Solewind was the most unfathomable and
mysterious, and Darknorth’s sword-intent domain was incredibly
tough to deal with. Even worse, Darknorth’s offensive sword-arts
had become so powerful that even Firesurge shivered when he saw them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why had the gap between
him and his colleagues grown so large?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge advanced
through the thousand kilometer long primessence chains, crushing his
way through all of the wraiths that tried to oppose him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How dominating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s plowing
through them in an even more brutal manner than Solewind did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Greatjoy, and the
others all smiled as they praised him. As for Daolord Owlbath and the
other twelve, they just stared intently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four hundred
kilometers. Five hundred. Six hundred…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge had
experienced numerous setbacks in life in order to reach his current
level, and he thus possessed an incredible mind and heart. He was
also very close to the others in combat power, and thus he was able
to forcibly disperse the wraiths with his attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just past the seven
hundred kilometer mark, Firesurge suddenly slowed down dramatically.
The smiles quickly disappeared from the faces of Ji Ning and
Greatjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!” Ning
was rather worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Waterlord
Firesurge was now moving slower and slower. He was still wiping out
the attacking wraiths, but Ning and the others could clearly tell
that something was hampering his combat performance. It seemed as
though he was struggling to maintain focus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AAARGH!” Waterlord
Firesurge let out a frustrated yell, then turned and left. He
retreated at high speeds, needing only a few seconds to escape the
chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had an ugly, savage
look on his face, and his eyes were filled with rage and resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Firesurge,”
Ning called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Firesurge, if we
fail the first time, we can try a second or a third time,” Greatjoy
said consolingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge took a deep
breath, taking control of his emotions. He nodded towards Ning and
the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning and
Greatjoy understand why Firesurge was so unhappy right now. If you
failed the first time, you would probably fail the next hundred times
as well unless you made significant gains in power or in mental
fortitude. Firesurge hadn’t even been able to make it to the eight
hundred kilometer mark! He had more than two hundred kilometers to go
if he wished to make it to the Prime Reaches. His chances were
extremely low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, the two
of you. The primessence chains are extremely difficult to deal with,”
Firesurge said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m amazed at how
nettlesome they are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Greatjoy both
felt a great sense of pressure. Firesurge was still the fourth
strongest World-level cultivator of the Twelve Kingdoms of
Brightshore, if one excluded Bertulu and Eastcult; he definitely was
a monstrously talented man! For him to have failed meant the
primessence chains were far more difficult to deal with than any of
them had expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your performance was
incredible, my young friend Firesurge.” Daolord Owlbath was still
eating and drinking in a leisurely fashion, and he grinned as he
called out, “To be able to make it nearly eight hundred kilometers
on the primessence chains is an absolutely incredible feat. Although
all of the World-level cultivators here in the Genesis Lands are
quite formidable, the vast majority are stymied at the five hundred
kilometer mark.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge’s failure
worried not just Ning and Greatjoy, it worried Skyfire Brightshore
even more. This prince of the Brightshore Kingdom was comparable to
Firesurge in power, but as for his heart and his willpower? He was
probably a bit inferior to even those three retainers. Even the
invisible willpower trial which was applied to all entrants into the
Genesis Lands had made him feel quite miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, let me
give it a try next.” Greatjoy’s eyes were filled with a
terrifying desire to do battle. He walked straight towards the
primessence chains then began to advance forwards. Ning and the
others simply watched silently from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind had drifted
through the chains like a calm, unflappable spring breeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge had fought
his way through the chains while radiating a powerful aura of murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Greatjoy, he
crushed his way through with absolute power as he advanced in a truly
imposing fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These young fellows
are all quite incredible.” Daolord Owlbath blinked. “This
Greatjoy guy has already made it past the eight hundred kilometer
mark. Uh… and that’s the nine hundred kilometer mark.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy was
clearly performing better than Firesurge had as he cruised through
the first nine hundred kilometers. However, at this point he
gradually began to slow down as well, and a solemn look appeared on
his face. His entire body began to radiate with golden light as he
continued to advance in a stable manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
began to grow nervous as they watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
armor-clad World Goddess Skywolf normally had a perpetually icy look
on her fair features, but now a look of worry had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the wraiths
were quite powerful, Prince Greatjoy still found it quite easy to
deal with them. And yet… his movements were growing slower and
slower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, at the nine
hundred and twenty kilometer mark, he came to a halt. He stood there,
easily deflecting the wraiths but unable to advance any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” A soft sigh…
then Prince Greatjoy also turned and left, not hesitating in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Peerless geniuses like
them knew when they had to go all-out and when they had to be
cautious! If you tried to force yourself past your limits in a place
like this, you would most likely fall into that abyss and be
destroyed in body and truesoul alike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy walked
back with a slight frown on his forehead, as though he was lost in
thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh.” Prince
Greatjoy glanced at the cultivators in front of him, then began to
chuckle . “When Solewind made it across, I figured the the
primessence chains couldn’t be that tough. Who would’ve thought
that the next two would both fail, myself included?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Greatjoy,
you made it much farther than I did,” Firesurge said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A failure is still
just a failure.” Prince Greatjoy shook his head, then looked at
Ning. “Darknorth, these primessence chains are incredibly strange.
You have to be careful not to let yourself be ensnared in those
illusions. The reason why I didn’t dare to advance any further was
because I realized that I had already reached my limits. If I
advanced any further, I would’ve been ensnared by those illusions
and would’ve been completely unable to deal with the other dangers
facing me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind was a
Heartforce Cultivator and thus was the best-equipped to deal with
this issue. That was why he had been able to cruise through with
ease. Alas, Firesurge and Greatjoy had both failed despite being
incredibly talented figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Owlbath
and the other twelve World-level cultivators, they sighed with
amazement. Although Greatjoy and Firesurge had both failed, they had
both made it incredibly far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Firesurge and I will
probably wander through the various places in the outer reaches of
the Genesis Lands. We’ll only come back here if we are able to grow
significantly more powerful.” Greatjoy looked at Ning. “Darknorth,
I wouldn’t mind having you by my side as we wander through the
outer reaches.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You might not mind,
but I sure as hell would.” Ning laughed. “I still want to wander
the Prime Reaches alongside Solewind. The poor guy will be lonely if
he has to go through that place by himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning strode
confidently towards the primessence chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, Master.”
The Flamefairy Su Youji was quite worried. She knew her own limits
and knew that she probably stood no chance of making it into the
inner reaches, but she truly hoped that Ji Ning would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Prime Reaches was a
place which even the Eternal Emperors of this universe wished to
enter, and it was also the place which had completely transformed the
master of the Church of Annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning advanced through
the primessence chains as electric light and watery light surged out
of his body. The seven types of Dao lightning and Dao water formed an
awe-inspiring Yin-Yang Sword Domain around him which furiously
repelled and slew all enemies in range of him. The attacking wraiths
were all ground to dust before even getting close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The way in which Ning
was advancing through the chains was even more lofty and imposing
than Solewind’s. His Yin-Yang Sword Domain truly was the perfect
weapon for dealing with group attacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prime Reaches…”
Ning stared forwards at the other end of the chains, where the inner
reaches lay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had fought so hard
for this chance, and in the end he had been able to make it into the
Genesis Lands of this alternate universe. Was he going to fail now,
at the very last moment?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a huge
difference between the outer reaches and the inner reaches!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Solewind,
just wait a moment for me,” Ning called out, his eyes brimming with
the intent to do battle. His Yin-Yang Sword Domain swirled around him
as he continuously advanced through the long primessence chains.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 – The Inner Reaches
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ji Ning
stepped onto the primessence chains, he could sense an invisible web
of power wash over him. He felt as though a strange melody was
playing nonstop within his sea of consciousness. Still, Ning was no
ordinary World-level cultivator. He was able to easily ignore a
disruptive influence on this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He walked forward
through the chains, moving tremendously fast, and as he did the
various ghosts began to flicker towards him from afar, throwing
themselves at Ning. Alas, Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain stretched
out to encompass an area of eight hundred kilometers. As soon as the
wraiths charged into his domain, they were instantly ground into
nothingness. Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain was capable of slaying
even Daolords of the First Step, much less mere wraiths!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? The invisible
power covering the primessence chains seems to be growing stronger
and stronger.” Ning continuously advanced towards the inner
reaches, and the sound of the melody grew increasingly loud as well.
The melody was constantly distracting him, despite his best efforts.
It sang of a peerlessly beautiful maiden, of endless treasures, of
the ineffable Hegemon, of the warmth of family, of the undying ardor
of love, of the deep, warm-blooded feelings which friends and
brothers shared with each other…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an absolute
delight. It told him that if he truly fell into the song and allowed
himself to be intoxicated by it, that he would have all of these
things and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring power of
the song grew stronger and stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight hundred
kilometers. Nine hundred kilometers! He’s hit the nine hundred
kilometer mark. Darknorth is way too strong.” Daolord Owlbat stared
wide-eyed in shock. “He’s merely using a domain, but he’s still
able to crush all of those wraiths. He hasn’t even used any actual
techniques at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and the others
watched nervously as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He hit the nine
hundred mark?” Firesurge watched quietly. Of the four geniuses of
the Twelve Palaces, both Ji Ning and Greatjoy had made it past the
nine hundred kilometer mark. Firesurge, however, hadn’t even made
it to the eight hundred mark!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth’s
sword-intent domain truly is formidable.” Prince Greatjoy smiled.
“His domain alone is enough for him to defeat all of the attacking
wraiths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yin-Yang Sword
Domain was a Supreme Dao, after all, and this one in particular was
terrifyingly strong due to it having been formed by seven types of
Dao lightning and Dao water. In terms of raw power, it was only
slightly weaker than the killer attacks of Greatjoy and Solewind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
wraiths focused on attacking en masse. The Yin-Yang Sword Domain was
literally developed for the express purpose of defeating massed
attackers! In addition, it had been easy for all four of them to deal
with the wraiths; none of them had been forced to show their true
power. All four of them were comparable to Daolords of the Second
Step. Clearing, the trial of the primessence chains didn’t place
too heavy an emphasis on raw power; so long as you were comparable to
a strong Daolord of the First Step, you’d be able to handle the
wraiths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine hundred twenty.
Nine hundred thirty. Nine hundred forty. Nine hundred fifty…” Su
Youji counted softly to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was watching
with bated breath. Was yet another member of the group about to pass
through the primessence chains?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy fell
silent. He simply watched as Ning advanced farther than he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The invisible power
covering the primessence chains weren’t completely focused on Ji
Ning in specific. It would be more accurate to say that the
primessence chains were innately filled with a mysterious power which
naturally emanated outwards, resulting in them affecting Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer Ning moved
to the inner reaches, the stronger the power released by the
primessence chains became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The melody grew more
and more drifting and abstruse as it sought to seduce Ning into its
flows. In fact, Ning could almost see a series of illusory worlds
appear before him. If he stopped fighting back against them for just
a single instant, he would instantly be drawn into those illusory
worlds and lose himself within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine hundred eighty.
Nine hundred ninety…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance. Although the illusory melody was taking a firmer and firmer
grip over his mind and soul, he still continued to steadfastly defend
against its intrusions. He had just a single thought in his mind –
he wanted to keep focused on his goal of making it to the end of the
primessence chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he really going
to make it into the inner reaches?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So close. So close!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Owlbath and the
others stared in astonishment, as did Prince Greatjoy and Firesurge.
As for Su Youji, she was the most nervous of them all as she stared
unblinkingly at the domain-ensconced white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took one final
step and broke past the bewildering force covering the primessence
chains. The furious wraiths did their best to try to stop him, but
they were completely unable to go through the Yin-Yang Sword Domain
and touch Ning in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning
couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief when he took that final
step and entered the inner reaches. He then dismissed his Yin-Yang
Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prime Reaches…”
As soon as Ning stepped onto the other side, he could sense a surge
of invisible power rush towards him from the ground. The surge of
power warmed him, feeling almost like the embrace of a mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Then again, the Prime Reaches was the most central
location of the Genesis Lands. Even the prime essences of this
universe were located here. Even the strangest of phenomena were to
be expected of here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Darknorth.” Heartlord Solewind had stepped backwards to avoid the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain, but he now grinned as he advanced to move next
to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was far too
close for comfort. But, I made it.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is incredible
that you were able to make it this far, brother Darknorth. The
primessence chains truly do have an incredibly strong mental alluring
affect,” Solewind sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The effect was indeed
quite strong. Still, Ning knew that he had one particular advantage
over all three of the others! Greatjoy, Solewind, and Firesurge were
fairly ‘normal’ World-level cultivators. In battle, they could
instantly unleash a level of power comparable to that of Daolords of
the Second Step, but it was all thanks to their secret arts, divine
abilities, and insights into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, their power
was built off of World-level divine power and Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
different!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the power of the
azureflower mist energy, which was equivalent to Daolord-level
energy. It had nourished his soul, making it comparable to the soul
of a Daolord of the First Step! As a result, it was incredibliy
difficult to shake Ning’s soul and cause him to be trapped within
an illusion. Ning’s mental fortitude was actually merely on par
with Prince Greatjoy’s, but his soul was far stronger. As a result,
he was naturally able to do what Greatjoy could not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore was
a prince of the Brightshore Kingdom, a living being on the same level
of power as the Ancient cultivators, Bertulu, or Waterwalker. They
were amongst the most elite races of living creatures, giving them
souls that were incredibly strong and essentially on par with Ning’s
azureflower-reinforced soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar was another
example. He had trained in the [Thousand Bodies Sutra], and so his
divine body was comparable to a Daolord’s, as was his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was incredibly rare
for a World-level cultivator to have a Daolord-level soul. Solewind
was a Heartforce Cultivator, and so he had certain special techniques
which could be used to strengthen the soul, but in the end he was
still not nearly as strong in this regard as Ning and Bertulu were.
As for Greatjoy and Firesurge, they were somewhat weaker in this
regard as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only reason I
made it through was because I have the azureflower mist energy
sustaining and strengthening my soul. Heartlord Solewind, however,
made it through with ease. He really lives up to his reputation as
the one and only Heartlord of the Heartforce Palace,” Ning mused to
himself in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze shifted
towards the inner reaches. Previously, when he had been in the outer
reaches, he could see that there was an enormous world here but was
unable to make out any details at all. Now, however…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as scene of
chaos and decay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground was littered
with enormous gouges, holes, and craters. Clearly, they had been left
behind ancient powers who had battled against each other! These were
marks that had been left behind by swords and sabers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, he saw a series of badly damaged mountain ranges… as well
as a series of towering, massive corpses that emanated ripples of
terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These corpses…?”
Ning stared at them. Every single corpse emanated ripples of
incredible power that were just as strong as the aura which Lord
Woodflower had emanated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are these all
Eternal Emperors?” Ning mused. “It seems this place, the
birthplace of the universe, is actually a battlefield. But why the
hell are there so many Eternal Emperors here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal Emperors were
incredibly rare and few in number. Based on what Ning and the others
had learned, this was true even here in this alternate universe. In
the Endless Territories, the Brightshore Kingdom only had a few
Eternal Emperors total! But here in the Prime Reaches, Ning was able
to see at least twelve of this corpses which emanated auras of
terrifying power. All of them had to be Eternal Emperor level
corpses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And these were only the
ones he could see right now. Most likely, the Prime Reaches held far
more corpses within it. No wonder so many Eternal Emperors of the
Church of Annihilation had come here. No wonder the master of the
Church of Annihilation had been able to skyrocket in power after
entering this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Ji Ning, am
blessed to be able to be able to enter a place like this.” Ning
felt a great surge of joy swell in his heart. Those ten thousand
years of arduous travel and those multiple scrapes with death…
right now, Ning felt as though everything was worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfire is starting
as well,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning calmed himself
down, turning to stare at the other end of the primessence chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore had
moved onto the primessence chains as well. Although his soul was
comparable to Ning’s in strength, his mental fortitude was
incredibly weak. In the end, he simply hadn’t experienced enough.
Most likely, even an average World-level cultivator who had risen to
power in the mortal world and experienced all of its trials and
tribulations would have a far stronger mind and heart than he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Skyfire
Brightshore was brought to a quick halt. He managed to move close to
the five hundred kilometer mark, but in the end was forced to
retreat. A look of disappointment was on his face. He hadn’t even
been able to make it to the five hundred kilometer mark! Even if he
was able to somehow become much mentally tougher, he probably still
would have very little chance of traversing these primessence chains.

Chapter 24 – Thirty-Five Corpses
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have zero chance.
I’m not even close to meeting the mark.” Skyfire Brightshore left
the primessence chains, then shook his head ruefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let yourself
feel too depressed about this. At least the two of us will keep you
company, right?” Prince Greatjoy laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solewind is a
Heartforce Cultivator, remember?” Firesurge sent him a mental
message of consolation. “As for Darknorth, he joined the Twelve
Palaces just a short while ago but quickly rose to become the
second-ranked expert in our trials. His rate of improvement is
absolutely ridiculous. It’s not surprising that the two fo them
were able to make it into the inner reaches.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire nodded. Moments
later, Prince Greatjoy nodded as well. Although he was an incredibly
proud man, he had to admit that Ji Ning’s rate of improvement
really was fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I fall one step
behind, I’ll always be behind.” Firesurge frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, let’s not
get depressed.” Prince Greatjoy was in a fine mood. “In the end,
lucky encounters and karmic blessings might be useful, but
cultivation is ultimately up to yourself and your own efforts! They
are in the inner reaches while we are in the outer reaches, but we
won’t necessarily fall behind them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In fact, we
might actually overtake them.” Firesurge nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they all knew
that they were just pumping themselves up and encouraging themselves.
They all understood that the inner reaches had far more opportunities
hidden within them than the outer reaches did, and both Solewind and
Darknorth were just as talented as the three of them. There was no
way they wouldn’t improve even further!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy’s
retainer, ‘World Goddess Skywolf’, also gave the primessence
chains a try. In the end, she was forced to come to a halt at around
five hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flamefairy Su Youji
actually managed to make it close to the six hundred kilometer mark.
Clearly, she was quite skilled at defending against illusions, as
that was her own path as well. Alas, in the end she simply hadn’t
reached a high enough level of skill in this Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind’s retainer,
Chaos Immortal Swallowback, actually managed to make it all the way
to the nine hundred and ten kilometer mark! This badly shocked Ning
and all the other spectators. Who would’ve thought that he would be
able to make it this far?! This was almost as far as Prince Greatjoy
himself had made it, and was a far stronger performance than
Waterlord Firesurge’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, in an actual
battle he was far from being a match for Prince Greatjoy, Firesurge,
or Skyfire. In the field of resisting illusions, however, he was
clearly a very strong contender.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solewind and
Darknorth, the two of you can stay in the inner reaches. We’ll
wander the outer reaches. Don’t end up weaker than us by the next
time we meet!” Prince Greatjoy laughed from afar, his voice
rippling through space and making it to the other side of the chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll part ways
here. The two of you better not disappoint me!” A stubborn, intense
light gleamed in Firesurge’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Su Youji, she
stared at Ji Ning from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal
Swallowback did the same towards his own master, Heartlord Solewind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two parties
separated, heading off in different directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy and the
others depart, beginning their journey through the various mysterious
regions of the outer reaches. There, they would search for their own
karmic blessings and opportunities. As for Ning and Solewind, they
began their true journey into the Prime Reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crazy strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
these World-level cultivators come from?” The twelve spectators and
Daolord Owlbath were all utterly amazed. They had been wandering the
outer reaches for many years now, and dreamed of being able to make
it past the primessence chains. They knew exactly how hard it was for
one to be able to actually overcome the chains… but just now, two
of the eight World-level cultivators in that group, the ones named
‘Solewind’ and ‘Darknorth’, had actually succeeded. Two
others had made it past the nine hundred kilometer mark!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely amazing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how
extraordinarily strong their hearts and souls are, they must be under
the tutelage of a truly extraordinary power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No ordinary school
could possibly hand over eight Archaeus medallions at once.” They
couldn’t help but continue to chatter in amazement, having firmly
engraved the names and faces of Ning and the others in their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Solewind gave
the primessence chains a final glance. Prince Greatjoy and the others
had already flown away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Solewind said.” “Once we leave the Prime Reaches, we’ll meet
with them again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He had left a message-talisman with Su Youji. Once they left
the inner reaches, he would be able to locate her with ease, thanks
to his connection to that talisman. Most likely, Solewind had left
behind something similar with his own retainer, Chaos Immortal
Swallowback.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the inner
reaches was aw orld that was roughly a billion kilometers in size.
This wasn’t exactly small, but for cultivators of their power it
wasn’t exactly large either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was filled
with an aura of utterly immense power. All flight was impossible
here, and it was impossible for one to scan the area using godsense
or chaosense, much less engage in spatial teleportation! The only
option was to rely on one’s two feet. Thankfully, the two fo them
were able to walk quite quickly, moving far faster than the limits of
the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is an
ancient battlefield.” As Ning and Solewind advanced through this
world, they moved towards the peak of a mountain, then came to a halt
and surveyed the entirety of the inner reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as the eye could
see, the earth was littered with trenches, gouges, canyons, crater,
and rubble. This was a ruined, destroyed world. Look at that
terrifying gorge over there, filled with an utterly terrifying
sword-intent that was so strong that Ning could hardly breathe. The
strength and intensity of that sword-intent was so great that it was
definitely the most powerful sword-intent Ning had ever encountered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the most powerful
sword-strike of Emperor Mirrorsnow was significantly weaker compared
to the sword-intent radiating from that great gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Awe-inspiring
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bounding saber-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Billowing plumes of
watery light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaotic fields of
spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world of the
inner reaches was filled with the scars of battle. If you could
recognize a a leopard’s spots, you’d know you were looking at a
leopard. Just by looking at the remaining scars, Ning was able to
imagine how incredibly powerful the major powers who left the scars
behind were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many corpses…
and almost all of them are 540,000 meters tall,” Solewind said in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From our position
atop this mountain, I can see at least twenty-six corpses.” Ning
stared from afar as well. Due to the nearby mountains blocking off
his vision as well as the tremendous power throbbing within this
world, Ning wasn’t able to bend light and see far beyond the
surrounding mountains. In a ‘normal’ place, he would be able to
see everything for countless kilometers around him, even if he was
inside a completely sealed-off edifice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas… this place was
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They look like
cultivators, but all of their corpses are 540,000 meters tall. Some
of them are even larger! Those are probably the special lifeforms,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them should
be at the Eternal Emperor level,” Solewind evaluated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A divinity’s height
was one way to measure their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
reached the limits of power possible for World Gods, with a total of
36,000 godgems in their bodies. As for the Dao-tree within their
Jindan chaos regions, the trees were 108,000 meters tall. Their true
personal height was also roughly 108,000 meters tall! Many of the
great powers were born as ordinary mortals who were merely a few
meters tall, and thus they were accustomed to using those heights in
their ‘normal’ form. As a result, in both the Endless Territories
as well as this alternate universe, most people stayed at a ‘normal’
height of just a few meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the princes of the
Brightshore Kingdom whose true bodies were the size of chaos stars
would generally stay in a form where they were roughly on par with Ji
Ning in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The absolute hard limit
for World-level cultivators was 108,000 meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The absolute limit for
Daolords was 540,000 meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reaching this height
meant that you had reached the Verge of the Daomerge. One you
succeeded in your Daomerge, your divine body would remain 540,000
meters tall and be comprised of 540,000 godgems. The difference was…
upon succeeding in the Daomerge, the ‘Dao’ within those godgems
would gain true eternity, making your divine body both perfect and
eternal as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Solewind
continued to advance through the Prime Eaches, carefully analyzing
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them quickly
discovered two Daolords and three World-level cultivators in the
inner reaches! The world was just a billion kilometers in size, after
all. They were able to quickly scan through the entire place, and
they discovered a total of thirty-five corpses of incredible
antiquity. Each corpse emanated an aura of tremendous power that
carried a scent of eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-five Eternal
Emperors died here?” Solewind and Ning both felt breathless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even the Brightshore Kingdom only had a few Eternal Emperors,
and the number of Eternal Emperors belonging to the Aeonian Kingdom
could be counted on one hand. In general, Eternal Emperors were
incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-five Eternal
Emperors… this was an incredible, terrifying figure. And yet, such
a powerful force of cultivators had silently died in this place,
leaving behind few traces of their passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal Emperors are
truly eternal existences. If they die, they die because others killed
them. But in normal battles, a fatal end should result in their
divine bodies being destroyed. Their bodies are in perfect shape, and
all of them seem quite peaceful. Some were standing, some were
sitting… it seems as though they welcomed death peacefully.”
Solewind had a solemn look on his face as he sent, “I can’t even
imagine what level of power is needed to cause thirty-five Eternal
Emperors to silently, peacefully pass away into death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. This truly
was a terrifying thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place gave
birth to the entire universe, after all,” Ning sent mentally.
“There will always be secrets which we will never know the answers
to. We are still too weak and know too little.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Solewind
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve gone through
this entire world. It really is filled with many opportunities, but
all of them were left behind by these thirty-five ancient powers. We
haven’t found the prime essences of this universe at all,” Ning
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are too weak. We
probably aren’t able to find or locate them,” Solewind sent. “Let
us do the same as those two Daolords and World-level cultivators are
doing. Let us search for the legacies left behind by those
thirty-five major powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-five ancient
corpses had prepared for and welcomed death in a very calm manner,
and they had left behind all of their treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who were bound to
them by destiny would gain access to those treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
deceased major powers was terrifyingly strong. Three of them were
particularly terrifying, and the aura emanating from their corpses
was so strong that Ning felt certain that they were comparable to
that of the almighty Hegemon, who Ning had met in person.

Chapter 25 – Three Great Leaders
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ji Ning and
Solewind kept a cautious watch as they advanced through the world of
the inner reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
are you seeing what I’m seeing?” Heartlord Solewind suddenly
stared at one of the corpses in front of them, a corpse that was
seated in the lotus position and emanating an aura of faint golden
light. The awesome aura emanating from that corpse was boundlessly
majestic, and it would forever be an aura of true eternity. A total
of sixteen treasures had been placed before that corpse, and each of
the sixteen radiated extraordinary power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you talking
about how the corpses are divided up into three groups?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Heartlord
Solewind nodded. “The thirty-five corpses here seem to be divided
up into three groups, each of which had a leader. This corpse before
us, the one radiating golden light… it is one of the leaders. I
have the feeling that he was a Heartforce Cultivator who gained
eternity through that path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a shocked
look. “A Heartforce Cultivator? Are you sure about this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m absolutely
sure.” Solewind’s eyes were flickering with excitement as he
stared at the glowing golden corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel truly stunned, because Heartforce Cultivators truly were
incredibly rare. The entire Heartforce Palace only had a few
Daolords. For a Heartforce Cultivator to become an Eternal Emperor…
Ning had never even heard of such a figure. And yet, seated right
before him was the corpse of an Eternal Emperor who was a Heartforce
Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Solewind
couldn’t help but walk towards that seated corpse. Suddenly, a
series of invisible ripples swept outwards and brushed past the two
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
sensed a powerful force push back at him, making it impossible for
him to move forward by a single step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
there are no ties of destiny between this ancient power and myself.”
Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind, however,
suffered no impediments at all. He glanced at Ning. “Brother
Darknorth, although there are thirty-five other corpses here, I’ve
already decided that I’m going to choose this one and give it a
try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you’ve made up
your mind… all I can say is, be careful.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All thirty-five of
these ancient powers had peacefully welcomed death, leaving behind
all of their treasures and legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to
acquire them, you would have to overcome the trials and challenges
they had laid out! These trials were extremely dangerous, and some
were even lethal. Daolord Owlbath had long ago warned them that many
entered the inner reaches and then died there, never to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is one of the
three leaders within the inner reaches, and the only Eternal Emperor
who was also a Heartforce Cultivator.” Heartlord Solewind stared at
the towering, seated figure with a blazing look in his eyes. “No
one in the Heartforce Palace has ever been able to become an Eternal
Emperor through heartforce. Now that I’ve finally found someone who
was able to do this… I’ll risk everything I have. If I can learn
some of the techniques this ancient power used, I might have a shot
at gaining eternity in the future as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce Cultivators
had the most difficult path of all! The Sword Palace, Spacetime
Palace, and other palaces all had cultivators who were able to become
Eternal Emperors. The Heartforce Palace was the only palace which had
never produced a single one. In fact, the entire concept was unheard
of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet… here in the
inner reaches of the Genesis Lands of this alternate universe, they
had discovered the corpse of a deceased Heartforce Cultivator who had
reached that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m heading over
there.” Solewind looked at Ning. “Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
began to move forwards once more. Whoosh! A rippling wave of
spacetime swept past Solewind, causing him to completely disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there for a
brief moment. Sensing that the powerful barrier in front of him was
not going to disappear, he chose to turn and leave. He was still very
weak in terms of heartforce; clearly, he didn’t meet the minimum
threshold this deceased figure had left behind for those who wished
to acquire his treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning advanced by
himself through the inner reaches. The more he inspected those
thirty-five corpses, the more he got the feeling that they did indeed
belong to three different factions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the three most
powerful corpses, they had auras of incredible might that were
absolutely on par with the almighty Hegemon’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second leader.”
Ning stared at an enormous four-legged beast that had a pair of
curved horns on its head. Its aura was filled with the intent of
endless annihilation, and just looking at the beast made Ning’s
heart clench. Even in death, its eyes seemed cold, lofty, and proud.
This was a creature who was unwilling to bow its head to anyone.
Behind it were five Eternal Emperors that looked like its retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third leader.”
After walking forwards for a long period of time, Ning raised his
head and stared at the third leader. What he saw caused his eyes to
light up. This third leader was a sword-wielder!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw a towering man
standing there, both hands clenched around an enormous greatsword
that was a deep blue color. The hilt of the sword was pressed against
his chest while the tip leaned against ground. The man himself stood
there like the pillar which could hold up an entire world! He had a
distant gaze in his dead, peaceful eyes. Anyone who looked at him
would get the feeling that he would probably be able to survive even
the annihilation of the universe itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet… this
grandmaster of the Dao of the Sword, a man who emanated an incredibly
dense and heavy aura of sword-intent… had died here as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind him stood two
other men. One was a white-robed man with a smile on his face who
carried three swords on his back; a violet sword, a golden sword, and
a white sword. He stood there, emanating an aura of ephemeral grace,
and his invisible aura of sword-intent seemed similarly ephemeral.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other man was
dressed in azure armor and had a mask on his face, revealing only a
pair of eyes that were filled with hatred. Behind him there were nine
enormous blood-colored swords that had been plunged into the earth,
and every single sword carried an incredibly powerful aura of murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The
greatsword-wielding leader was able to convince two other Eternal
Emperors of the Dao of the Sword to stand behind him as they died.
The three of them had to be incredibly close friends or family,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An absolutely
overwhelming amount of power could be used to cause other major
powers to serve you, much as how the Eternal Emperors of the
Brightshore kingdom all served the almighty Hegemon. But when
everyone knew that death was certain… continued servitude was no
longer contingent on mere power alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you knew you were
going to die but still chose to stand behind someone, it most likely
meant that you felt tremendous amounts of affection for that person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s gaze
suddenly shifted to a nearby mountain range, located quite close to
the three towering masters of the Dao of the Sword. The entire side
of the mountain range had been completely carved flat, and the
surface was filled with multiple paintings of that
greatsword-wielding man. There were paintings of him in battle,
paintings of him smiling, and even paintings of him drinking wine in
a leisurely manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
nineteen of these paintings, and Ning could sense the deep emotions
that had been infused into every stroke. There was an intense sense
of longing and wistfulness in those paintings which hadn’t lessened
at all despite the passage of countless years. Clearly, the artist
truly missed the greatsword-wielding expert very much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who painted this?”
Ning mused. “It seems as though the artist had an extremely close
relationship to the deceased.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, I’ll
definitely have to go take a closer look at him.” Ning glanced at
the greatsword-wielding expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the greatsword-wielding expert was one of the three dead
leaders. When Ning looked at him, Ning could sense an aura that was
not one whit inferior to that of the almighty Hegemon’s! The two
other Eternal Emperors stood directly behind the greatsword-wielder,
and the trials the three had left behind were actually linked as
well. If Ning moved just a little bit closer, he would be drawn into
a danger-filled trial grounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had tested things
out already. When he moved closer to the corpses, he hadn’t been
pushed back by any invisible surges of power… but he knew that if
moved any further in that direction, he would immediately be drawn
into a world of trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really did
leave behind quite a few treasures.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For one, the greatsword
which the leader was leaning on emanated an aura of incredible
density and ponderance. Ning felt certain that this sword had to be a
Universe treasure! The weapons which the two experts behind him were
wielding were comparatively weaker, but they also had other treasures
which had been placed next to their corpses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the leader
himself, there was a total of twelve treasures which had been placed
in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-five corpses,
three of which belonged to experts of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning was in no
rush. He continued his explorations, moving to investigate the other
corpses. He even spent a bit of time inspecting the scars of battle,
because he was already gaining some insights from what he had seen
thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The canyon wind howled
through the mountains, carrying with it a mysterious, ancient aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind.” Ning
stood there in the center of the canyon, eyes shut as he focused on
everything around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world here was
distorted and shattered, and spacetime itself was in disarray. Ning
had entered this world, which was nothing more than something created
accidentally due to the battles between those major powers. It wasn’t
an actual trial-world, and so it wasn’t that dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strode through the
distorted fields of spacetime, avoiding the most dangerous places as
he continuously meditated on everything he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this the nature
of spacetime?” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fire blazed throughout
this area. There was the corpse of a major power seated in the lotus
position, and everything around him for a million kilometers was
bathed in endless flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This major power had
died long ago, but his Dao was eternal. As a result, it continuously
attracted and drew in flames from the surrounding world, causing the
conflagration to burn perpetually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped into the
flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer he moved
towards that major power, the hotter the flames burned. As Ning
walked through the flames, he could sense a hint of an eternal Dao of
fire which whispered through the tendrils of fire. Ning was able to
learn much as he carefully attuned himself to each flickering flame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fire…” Ning
murmured to himself.

Chapter 26 – Shadowless Sword-Intent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning continued his
journey through the world of the Prime Reaches, going through the
various battlefields and scars that had been left upon the land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While doing so, Ning
came to realize that there were actually thirty-nine different types
of scars! It must be understood that even Eternal Emperors who had
gained eternity through the Dao of the Sword would all have followed
different paths and interpreted their Daos in unique, special ways.
Thus, there were differences in the ‘Dao vestiges’ they left
behind through their attacks, making it fairly simple to
differentiate the scars and markings into multiple ‘types’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-nine? There
are thirty-five deceased major powers, and they match up to
thirty-five of the Dao vestiges left behind. But there are four types
of scars which don’t match up to anyone.” Ning was rather amazed
by this, as he had discovered something else as well. “The Daos of
those three leaders are all awesome and overwhelming, filled with
inconceivable force. But one of the four types of Dao vestiges can be
found everywhere, even though it seems plain and unremarkable. I
spent more than three hundred years inspecting this place before I
realized how terrifying it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, that
particular Dao vestige belonged to the Dao of Primordial Chaos. It
seemed very ordinary, but when you truly delved deep into it you
would realize that it had surpassed the level which those three
leaders were at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the battle that
was fought, there was someone who was even more powerful than those
three leaders.” Ning was truly stunned. He could sense that those
three leaders should have been on par with the almighty Hegemon
himself; even if they were weaker, they wouldn’t have been weaker
by much. But this fourth figure… Ning had the feeling that he had
actually surpassed the almighty Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s always a
mountain taller than the ‘tallest’ you’ve seen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“But what in the world happened here, within the Genesis Lands of
this universe?” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. Moments later, his
eyes lit up. “Still… as far as I’m concerned, this is an
enormous present for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent quite a
bit of his time and energy on attuning to the various different Dao
vestiges that had been left behind, especially the strongest vestige
of a Dao of Primordial Chaos. Every so often, he would nap at the top
of a mountain. At other times, he would sit down in the lotus
position next to a river, listening to its waters gurgle. He would
walk through an icy land of snow, then occasionally drift within the
waters of a lake… and just like that, 6913 years went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a certain
type of a sword in this world. It is unfathomable and inscrutable,
traceless and untrackable. The moment it appears is the moment when
the enemy shall perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile
as he drew out Violetjewel, then struck out with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and his sword
both completely vanished, becoming truly traceless and untrackable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t a spatial
teleportation. It wasn’t a secret art of some sort. Just like that…
Ning vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pop! Three thousand
meters away, Ning suddenly reappeared as his sword chopped downwards
towards a mental target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What type of a sword
can truly be described as traceless and untrackable? An invisible
sword, a sword you cannot see or sense at all. This type of sword is
the most difficult sword to defend against.” A smile was on Ning’s
face as he turned his gaze towards the corpses of the ancient powers
that were off in the distance, then bowed deeply in gratitude and
respect. “Thank you, seniors. I have finally developed the
sword-intent of my ‘Shadowless’ stance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Shadowless stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, when Ning
used this stance, he would use various omnipresent Daos to greatly
enhance the speed of his strikes. For example, if he was in a windy
area he would borrow the power of the wind itself, while if he was in
a sunny area he would borrow the power of light. He could even borrow
the power of the spatial ripples which filled almost every place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because this was a
technique which borrowed the power of various different Daos, Ning’s
Shadowless stance was truly ghostly and inscrutable, allowing it to
fluctuate and speed up in odd ways, giving it tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… his stance
had never been able to improve to reach the same level which his
Yin-Yang sword-intent and his Blood Drop sword-intent were at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after coming to
the inner reaches and seeing all the Dao vestiges left behind by many
Eternal Emperors, especially the vestiges related to the deceptively
simple and yet overwhelmingly powerful Dao of Primordial Chaos, had
Ning suddenly realized the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What does
‘Shadowless’ even mean? It isn’t about borrowing from the power
of all things around it; it means to truly become one with all
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way a
sword can truly ‘vanish’, but when it becomes one with all things
around it will become completely indetectable to any enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the weather is
windy, it can transform into a gust of wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When it is bright,
it can transform into a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When it is in space,
it can transform into a spatial ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single part of
a universe, no matter where, is subject to the influence and power of
the prime essences of that universe. If my sword can completely merge
into those things, it’ll naturally become truly shadowless and
invisible.” Ning finally realized what his true goal for his
‘Shadowless’ stance should be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, after having
spent 6913 years in the inner reaches meditating on the various
different Dao vestiges, he was finally able to develop a completely
new Shadowless stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body was as
tough as a magic treasure. Just like his sword, it could also merge
into all things. After both he and his sword did so, his attacks
became even faster and even more ghostly than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At present, I can
just barely merge my sword into its surroundings. Although it cannot
be seen, it can still be detected through godsense,” Ning mused to
himself. “As my skill in this stance improves, I’ll be able to
truly make it one with all things, making it so that not even
godsense will be able to detect it. Only then will this stance be
truly deadly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was present in
all places. One day, his Shadowless stance would also be in all
places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword which not even
godsense could detect, a sword which you would only see when it
suddenly plunged into your skull… how terrifying such a sword would
be! But of course, actually reaching this level would be very
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can train this
technique to the apex, it will become truly shadowless and formless,
capable of appearing anywhere. Alas… I’m still far, far away from
that stage.” Ning knew how far he still had to go. In fact, he had
actually witnessed someone else who had succeeded in this goal –
the major power who wielded the Dao of Primordial Chaos. The
primordial chaos encompassed all Daos. The reason why it had taken
Ning so long to discover that this major power was even stronger than
those three leaders was precisely because this power’s Dao of
Primordial Dao was nigh-invisible, having seamlessly integrated all
the other Dao vestiges into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after carefully
inspecting the inner reaches for many years did he come to this
shocking realization!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for that major
power… he had infused all things into his Dao, making it almost
indetectable by even godsense or heartforce. One could only discover
it through other means.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the [Brightmoon]
sword-art, Ning now had three complete sword-intents; the Blood Drop
sword-intent, the Yin-Yang sword-intent, and the new Shadowless
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Shadowless
sword-intent had a weakness in that it could be detectable through
godsense, strictly speaking this wasn’t really a weakness. How many
Daolords could make themselves undetectable to godsense, after all?
Because the Shadowless sword-intent could be merged into all things
and all Daos, it was now even faster and even more inscrutable than
before. This made it far more powerful, and it had been fundamentally
transformed, allowing it to skyrocket to the same level as that of
the Blood Drop sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” As Ning
walked through the world of the inner reaches, he’d occasionally
disappear without a single sound, then reappear a few hundred
thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how he
‘walked’. He had incorporated his training in the Shadowless
stance into his way of walking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I didn’t have
the chance to meditate on the Dao vestiges left behind by so many
Eternal Emperors, it would’ve taken me at least a hundred million
years to master this stance,” Ning mused. The other four of the
five stances of [Brightmoon] required meditation and sudden
epiphanies, while the Shadowless stance required Ning to broaden his
horizons and gain many new experiences. Thanks to the many Dao
vestiges left behind by the Eternal Emperors in this world, Ning
managed to comprehend his enhanced stance far more quickly than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Dao which
Ning possessed would become a Supreme Dao. For instance, his
attacking Daos included the Blood Drop sword-intent and the
Shadowless sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop
sword-intent, at its peak, would allow Ning to annihilate all
obstacles in his path. Space… time… nothing would be able to par
his sword, which would reach incalculable levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless
sword-intent, at its peak, would make it so that the enemy would be
completely incapable of locating Ning before dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve now developed
three of the five true stances of [Brightmoon]. The Soleheart stance
and the Heavenbreaker stance are left,” Ning mused. The Soleheart
stance would be a defensive Dao, whereas the Heavenbreaker stance
would be another offensive Dao. Each of the stances would be
fundamentally different from the three which had come before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.” Ning
continuously disappearing and reappeared as he advanced at high
speeds. He was now moving even faster than his previous maximum
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This movement skill of
his could be described as the ‘Shadowless’ evasion skill. Most
likely, the large majority of Daolords would be unable to catch up to
Ning in pure speed. This was why Supreme Daos were so terrifying!
Each and every Supreme Dao was utterly unearthly in power. Even if
you only came up with one of them, you would definitely become a
truly terrifying Daolord in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leaders?” Ning
stood there, head upraised as he stared at the three sword-wielding
figures off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front was the
muscular man who was gripping that enormous deep blue greatsword.
Behind him was the white-robed man who was carrying a violet sword, a
golden sword, and a white sword on his back, and to the side of the
white-robed man was the terrifying man who had plunged nine
blood-colored swords into the ground before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the only
three experts of the Dao of the Sword who were within the Inner
Reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three seniors.”
Ning bowed respectfully. He felt tremendous veneration towards these
experts who had reached such heights in the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to move
forwards. Soon, he could sense a series of invisible ripples spread
over his body. If he advanced any further, he would be swept away and
taken to the trial grounds. Many dazzling geniuses and Daolords had
perished within these trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My opportunity is
right before me. How can I possibly shrink back from it?” Ning
didn’t hesitate at all as he took one more step forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was completely
enveloped by those invisible ripples. This time, Ning didn’t use
his Shadowless evasion-art. Instead, he truly disappeared into thin
air, having been teleported into the trial-world which had been left
behind by these three powers.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time as Ji
Ning was entering the trial-world left behind by the three
grandmasters of the Dao of the Sword, something else was happening in
the outer reaches of the Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was region of
complete darkness. Only a single source of light could be seen – a
solitary figure who stood there, emanating an aura of golden light.
This was Prince Greatjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of ripples
emanated outwards from him, causing spacetime to continuously
fluctuate. Even though he had yet to strike, it was evident that the
aura of power surrounding him was significantly greater than it had
been in the past. He had reached a brand new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True freedom and
free will. From this day forth… I, Greatjoy, have truly reached the
peak. I am no longer any weaker than Bertulu or Eastcult.” Prince
Greatjoy revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had journeyed
with the others to the primessence chains, Ji Ning and Solewind had
managed to pass while he had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy was an
incredibly proud figure. He accepted his loss with seemingly good
grace, but in reality a seed of resentment had been buried deep
within his heart that day. Now, he had finally managed to perfectly
merge his offensive Dao and his defensive Dao together, resulting in
him growing more powerful yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, only two
members of the World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces of the
Brightshore Kingdom had been able to reach this level – Bertulu and
Eastcult. Now, Greatjoy had joined their ranks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The level I have
reached is the true apex of power for any World-level cultivator.”
Prince Greatjoy nodded slowly. “Now, it no longer matters what
mysteries or marvels the Prime Reaches contain. There is nothing that
can result in me improving much more. However, I still want to pay a
visit to that place. Perhaps I might acquire a few special treasures
that will be of use to me once I become a Daolord in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was back home in
the Brightshore Kingdom, he probably would’ve made some simple
preparations then immediately broke through to become a Daolord.
However, if he did so here in the alternate universe, he would never
be able to go back home again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy had two
Supreme Daos. He had now merged them together in a perfect fashion,
resulting in him reaching the apex of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind
continued to experience many life-and-death trials within the
trial-world left behind by the Heartforce Cultivator leader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning? He had
just entered the trial-world of those three grandmasters of the Dao
of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense an
invisible surge of power spread out and cover him, instantly warping
him away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” When he could
once again make out his surroundings, he was rather startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around him was
filled with living creatures, as far as the eye could see. He could
even make out a giant citadel off in the distance, a citadel that
emanated an aura of utterly breathtaking power. Although it didn’t
affect Ning too much, normal World-level cultivators wouldn’t be
able to resist the aura at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning’s gaze suddenly fell upon a seemingly-ordinary rock nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This rock was a very
ordinary one… but all of a sudden, a series of golden characters
began to fly out from within it, as well as a map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Abyss of Fiends
has a thirty-six layered world. It was created as a trial ground by
three grandmasters of the Dao of the Sword. The twelfth layer, the
twenty-fourth layer, and the thirty-sixth layer all have exit
tunnels. These are the only ways out, the only ways by which you can
leave and return to the Genesis Lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember this. Only
the strong will win what they desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden words and
the map levitated there in the air for a moment, then quickly
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his gaze
while sweeping out with his godsense to scan the area for a billion
kilometers around him. The only building in this area was that
towering citadel, and the citadel was filled with ten million
cultivators, with the three strongest being a trio of World-level
cultivators. Those three World-level cultivators were bold, heroic
figures, but when they sensed Ning’s godsense lock onto them they
were horribly frightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What powerful godsense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that many years ago, when Ning had visited the Eastsmoke branch of
the Bluegrace Sect, he had been able to use his godsense to
simultaneously crush the godsenses of more than three hundred other
World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three
grandmasters died countless years ago, but there are still so many
living creatures here within the world they left behind to test their
would-be heirs,” Ning mused. The reason why he had scanned the area
was because he could tell that the restrictive spells covering the
citadel didn’t seem to be all that powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning took a
step forward, then completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who did that
godsense belong to?! It was ridiculously strong. This world is a
trillion kilometers in size, but there aren’t many with godsense on
that level.” A golden-robed elder was seated in the lotus position,
a frown on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
suddenly appeared out of nowhere on the seat located next to him. The
youth sat there calmly as he stared at the golden-robed expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” The
golden-robed elder was horrified as he stared at the white-robed
youth. “Y-you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a World-level
cultivator! He was someone who stood at the very peak of power within
this world. And yet, this youth was powerful enough to appear next to
him without him even noticing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a few
questions,” Ning said..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please ask them,
senior.” The golden-robed elder’s heart was quivering in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope you will not
try to lie to me. If you lie… you should be able to guess what will
happen,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed elder
hurriedly smiled. “Senior, if you wished to kil me you could
probably do so with a flick of your fingers. This junior would never
dare to deceive you or hide anything from you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I ask
you this – have you heard of the Abyss of Fiends?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Abyss of Fiends?
I have, of course I have.” The golden-robed elder gave Ning a
curious look. Logically speaking, every top-level expert in this
world should know about the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze hardened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed elder
said hurriedly, “This world of ours is a trillion kilometers in
size, and powerful experts are as common as the clouds. Many experts
have been born over the course of countless years, but the most
powerful figures have always been the terrifying devils of the Abyss
of Fiends. According to the stories, there are a total of thirty-six
levels to the Abyss of Fiends. Countless devils live in that place,
and some of them are so incredibly strong that they are honored with
the tile of ‘fiendlord’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single chaos
cycle, a large number of devils will charge forth from the Abyss of
Fiends under the guidance of a fiendlord and sweep through this
world. When this happens, all of the experts within this world must
join together if they wish to withstand the assault. But of course,
sometimes we will fail. In any case, the devils will have to retreat
back into the Abyss of Fiends after a brief period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned.
“fiendlord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Know thy enemy and know
thyself; only then would you be the victor in every battle. The
reason why Ning had come to interrogate this local expert was because
he wanted to learn more regarding this Abyss of Fiends. This was at
trial-world established by three Eternal Emperors, after all, and one
of them was on the same level of power as the almighty Hegemon
himself. There was no such thing as being too cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends, the first twelve layers of the Abyss only hold a single
fiendlord. Starting from the thirteenth level, each level shall have
many fiendlords within them. The fiendlords are extremely powerful,
and it is easy for them to kill us.” The golden-robed elder sighed.
“As for what the final twelve levels hold… that is a mystery to
us all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly, as
if enlightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This world was merely a
trillion kilometers in size. After some detailed questioning, Ning
came to understand that the strongest experts here were merely are
the World level. Those who reached the Daolord level would all vanish
without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Abyss of
Fiends?” Ning stood at the peak of a mountain, staring off into the
distance towards the great black abyss, a circular hole in the earth
that was a million kilometers in circumference. The abyss was so deep
that there was no way one could see to its bottom. The only thing one
could sense was that terrifyingly baleful aura emanating from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the trial
which the grandmasters left behind?” Ning revealed a hint of a
smile. These so-called ‘trials’ were actually processes of
elimination. Major powers were all incredibly proud figures, and thus
ordinary cultivators were not qualified to even attempt to peek at
their treasures. It must be understood that any of the treasures left
behind by Hegemon-level figures would assuredly be valuable beyond
price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if I, Ji
Ning, will be found worth by the three grandmasters.” Ning
transformed into as treak of sword-light, then flew out while using a
hint of the Blood Drop sword-intent. The streak of sword-light
instantly charged into the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black mist wafted
outwards from this place, carrying strange spatial ripples with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning soon
arrived at the first level of the Abyss of Fiends. This first level
was a world of volcanos, lava, and endless amounts of blazing light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept out with his
godsense but wasn’t too worried. The first twelve levels only held
a single fiendlord, after all. Even the local World-level cultivators
would often come adventuring through the first level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This leve is roughly
ten billion kilometers in size and constitutes a world unto itself.
It has more than three hundred devils, each of which has the aura of
an ordinary World-level cultivator.” Ning’s hands tightened
around his sword, Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone has come
from the World Above!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually dares to
intrude into our world, the Abyss of Fiends?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning stretched out
with his godsense it instantly attracted the attention of some of the
nearby devils, causing them to charge towards Ning. These fiends all
belonged to the same race, a race with grayish-black skin, veiny
wings, and a pair of sharp claws that glimmered with metallic light.
These devils were able to easily surpass the limits of the Heavenly
Daos when flying, and the invisible aura of power surrounding them
was quite great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the area
with his gaze… and his gaze transformed into swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of
sword-intents burst forth, transforming into an enormous Yin-Yang
Sword Domain that was like a terrifying grindstone that easily ground
away all of the attacking devils. The attacking devils were utterly
terrified – this foe was actually able to kill them with just his
sword-intent alone?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
quite calm. These little devils weren’t even worthy of him using
his Dao lightning or Dao water. Using his intent alone to form the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain resulted in a domain which had perhaps only
10%-20% of his full power, but it was enough to effortlessly wipe
through these opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying
sword-intent washed out wantonly, easily annihilating all invading
devils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to fly
downwards, passing through the ground and another layer of black mist
before arriving at the second level of the Abyss of Fiends.

Chapter 28 – Death Approaches
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning charged through
one level after another, easily battling his way all the way down to
the twelfth level. Thus far, he hadn’t even needed to draw his
sword; his Yin-Yang Sword Domain was enough to sweep through all
obstacles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Level twelve.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood atop a hill
and was staring off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelfth level of
the Abyss of Fiends was a world of dark-red earth and dark-red
mountains. Even the rivers were dark-red in color. The only thing
that was different was a pitch-black whirlpool that could be seen off
in the distance. The whirlpool was enormous in size and emanated
powerful spatial ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that a
teleportation tunnel?” Ning recognized it right away. This was a
spatial corridor that would allow the user to safely pass through it
and leave this place. However… was he supposed to leave before he
even encountered any fortunes or opportunities? Ning certainly wasn’t
willing to resign himself to such a thing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that someone making it to the twelfth level meant nothing to those
three grandmasters of the sword. Forget about Ji Ning; even some of
the local World-level cultivators were able to make it to this level!
As Ning had travelled downwards, he had discovered quite a few magic
treasures left behind by the locals who had challenged this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the twelfth
level. There should be a fiendlord here. Supposedly, large groups of
fiendlords roam the deeper depths of the Abyss of Fiends, and every
chaos cycle there will be a fiendlord who will lead the devils out of
the Abyss to assault the world outside. However… since they are
often defeated, I imagine that the so-called fiendlords aren’t that
powerful either.” Ning revealed a smile. He really didn’t hold
these fiendlords in any regard. He spread out his godsense once more,
using it to instantly encompass the entire twelfth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once his godsense
spread out, it immediately startled awake the devils on this level as
well as an extremely powerful devil… the so-called fiendlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short period of time
passed, enough for a kettle of tea to be boiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning’s sword
stabbed through the dark-red skin of a gigantic devil. Previously,
the devils all had grayish-black skins. This particular devil was
much larger and had dark-red skin; it was a fiendlord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graa… graa…”
The fiendlord’s throat had been pierced through, but it continued
to make those strange yelping sounds as it swiped its sharp claws
towards Ning, seeking to dismember him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine sword in
Ning’s hands sliced out out in a series of bizarre arcs of
sword-light, splitting the fiendlord with three strikes. However, the
fiendlord’s body then quickly reformed and healed and it let out a
furious roar as it once more charged towards Ning. Every single punch
and kick it unleashed was filled with incredible power that caused
its own body to tremble. Clearly, it didn’t have extremely fine,
minute control over its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, for example, was
capable of easily crushing and annihilating the power contained
within entire chaosworlds. He was completely surrounded by his
sword-light, and none of the power was able to escape at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
flashed out, resulting in the fiendlord being bisected at the waist
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning first used his
Yin-Yang Sword Domain, then his Blood Drop stance, then the
Shadowless stance, then his other techniques to repeatedly dominate
and clobber the fiendlord for nearly a full hour. Although this was a
creature which was born for battle, it had been dominated so
effortlessly and rurthlessly that after a full hour, it finally knew
fear and chose to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t too hard to
kill a fiendlord, but to frighten it so much that it would flee for
its life? This wasn’t easy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. This fiendlord’s
body is fairly tough, probably comparable to that of a Daolord of the
Second Step.” Ning nodded slightly. “However… it has an
incredibly low level of insight into the Dao. Any random World-level
cultivator would be far superior to him in this regard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After testing out the
fiendlord several times, Ning realized that although a single
fiendlord would pose no threat to other monstrously talented
World-level cultivators like Prince Greatjoy, in sufficient numbers
they would still be dangerous. This was because they had bodies
comparable to Daolords of the Second Step, which meant their attack
power was dangerously high. Their weakness lay in the fact that their
attacks were a bit clumsy and easy to dodge, but with enough attacks
they could bury you in a storm of strikes which would be very
difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, since Ning had
his Yin-Yang Sword Domain as well as seven types of Dao lightning and
Dao water, it would be much easier for him to deal with massed
fiendlords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
Bathed in sword-light, Ning began to fly downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He easily traversed the
ground beneath him, passing through yet another world-membrane and
reaching the thirteenth level of the Abyss of Fiends. This was a
blood-red world which emanated an endless stench of blood and an
alluring aura which sought to guide the hearts of any cultivators
here in descending into madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s godsense
quickly spread out to cover this world. This world only had eight
living creatures, all of which were fiendlords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight fiendlords
were all located in separate regions of this world, but they all now
flew straight towards Ning. In his previous battle against a single
fiendlord, Ning had thoroughly dominated it for nearly a full hour
before it chose to flee. This was a testament to how ferocious and
savage these creatures truly were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How weak.” Ning
held them in no regard at all, easily defeating one of the nearest
fiendlords as he flew down towards the fourteenth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to fly
down one level at a time. His Yin-Yang Sword Domain ensured that
these fiendlords were unable to pose any threat to him whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning reached the
nineteenth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had thought that
he would go through this level quite easily as well, but when he
noticed that this level had an Eternal weapon within it, he
immediately knew that things wouldn’t be that easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first thirteen
levels held quite a few treasures left behind by deceased
cultivators, but those cultivators were probably all locals. At best,
their weapons were mostly Dao weapons. From the fourteenth level to
the eighteenth level, I saw no treasures at all.” Ning had a solemn
look on his face. “But the nineteenth level actually has an Eternal
weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way these
locals could possibly forge an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning scanned the level
warily with his godsense. This level merely had nineteen of this
fiendlords. It didn’t seem to be all that different from the
seventeenth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHOOOSH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, an aura of
power burst forth from deep within the ground, so powerful as to
cause even Ning to be slightly shaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw the ground split
apart, far off in the distance, as a figure suddenly sprang out. This
figure was dressed in azure armor and had a mask on, with only his
cold eyes being visible behind them. On his back, he was carrying a
total of nine blood-colored swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ning’s
face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had seen those three
grandmasters of the sword in the outside world. The strongest had
been comparable to the almighty Hegemon, the towering man who had
been wielding that deep-blue greatsword. The other two had been his
friends or retainers, and one of them looked exactly identical to the
man who had just appeared, except the ‘original’ version had
plunged those nine blood-colored swords into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can slay me,
you will win the nine treasures which Master left behind. Those nine
swords accompanied Master for countless years and possess such
extraordinary power that they are incredibly close to Universe
treasures in power. Even if you do not wish to use them and choose to
sell them off… every single sword will fetch you at least fifty
million cubes of chaos nectar. If you sell them off as a set, they
will be of incalculable value,” the azure-armored figure said
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those nine swords were
indeed incredibly valuable… but Ning didn’t feel the slightest
bit of avarice at all. The entire time, he stared unblinkingly at the
azure-armored figure in an incredibly serious manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the figure
spoke of his ‘Master’, the terrifying aura of the sword-intent
residing within his body was absolutely identical to that of the
deceased grandmaster outside! Their auras were auras of murder and
slaughter, but exalted to a level that surpassed Ning’s current
level by unfathomable amounts. In fact… Ning felt certain that this
was what the sword-intent of a true Eternal Emperor would feel like!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just at the
World level. To be able to beat the fiendlords is one thing, but this
guy seems to have a terrifyingly high level of insight into the Dao.”
Ning had already manifested his [Three Heads, Six Arms], and he
gripped his six Eternal swords as he waited solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not be afraid.
These nine swords on my back are not the actual swords which Master
used; they are nothing more than nine Dao weapons which Master
casually forged before his death.” The azure-armored figure walked
towards Ning, every step echoing with his killing intent. His every
movement felt like the crash of armies and chariots, filled with
murder and such despair that even Ning felt breathless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood how
deadly this would be. Anyone capable of passing the primessence
chains and entering the Prime Reaches would be a genius amongst
geniuses… but judging from the nineteen Eternal weapons and various
storage treasures, more than one person had perished here! And no
wonder… this opponent was absolutely terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you slay me,
you’ll earn those nine swords which Master used,” the
azure-armored figure urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes grew
colder and colder. When he had arrived in this world, he had seen
that those nine blood-colored swords had been plunged deep into the
ground. No one was able to take those swords away! In other words…
there had never been any World-level cultivator capable of killing
this azure-armored figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were like
ice. Ignoring all else, he instantly unleashed his dazzling Dao
lightning and Dao water, transforming them into enormous swords that
furiously swept out, instantly turning a region of ten thousand
kilometers around him into a terrifying, desolate wasteland of the
Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
azure-armored figures, he didn’t seem to see or hear any of this at
all as he continued to walk towards Ning’s direction, towards that
wasteland filled with nothing but swords.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Yin-Yang Sword
Domain is one of my best killing techniques. Let’s see how it does
first.” Ji Ning wanted to use his domain to test his opponent out
first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
figure suddenly manifested a total of nine arms that reached out and
drew those nine blood-colored swords. The nine swords suddenly began
to vibrate slightly, in doing so somehow coming together to naturally
form a layer of strange sword-light which served as a rippling
barrier around him. He slowly strode forwards, delving deeper and
deeper into the area of effect of Ning’s domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light barrier
formed by those nine swords were able to easily pierce through Ning’s
Yin-Yang Sword Domain, almost as if they were fish moving through
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what…” Ning
was in control of the domain, but he felt as though his opponent was
as slippery as an eel, making it impossible for him to land a true
attack against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t all that
strong; most likely, he’s not even at the World level of power. The
problem is that he has a ridiculously high level of insight.” Ning
was able to clearly make out every movement the opponent made, but
Ning truly found it difficult to understand how those nine swords
resonated together to form a rippling barrier of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a Sword Dao of
the Eternal Emperor level. It must be understood that in the
Brightshore Kingdom, the Sword Palace didn’t have a single living
Eternal Emperor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
How should I deal with him?” Ning was growing rather nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense his
opponent wasn’t all that strong, which was what he had expected; if
his opponent had the insights of an Eternal Emperor and the strength
of a Daolord, there was no way Ning would be able to stand a chance
against him! And yet… while Ning was as fast and as stronger as a
Daolord of the First Step, he still felt as though he was completely
unable to land any blows against this weaker opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
frustrating part of battling someone who had a higher level of
insight than yourself. You might be strong, but you’d have no way
of making use of that strength. As for your opponent, he would be
able to make his attacks a thousand times more effective than they
had any right to be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Sword Dao
domain is actually able to slow me down a bit.” The azure-armored
figure continued to advance calmly as he spoke. “It isn’t bad,
actually. However… if this is all you have, you aren’t even close
to being qualified to win Master’s treasures. Better for you to die
instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He clearly could’ve
advanced quite quickly, but he instead chose to advance at a steady
gait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” A flash of
light went off inside Ning’s head as he stared at the rippling
barrier of sword-light… but a moment later, the insight vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were ten thousand
kilometers apart. Although the azure-armored figure walked rather
slowly, he reached Ning in just ten short seconds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The killing intent in
his eyes exploded as all nine of his blood-colored swords began to
move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine swords struck
out in a consecutive, orderly fashion, carrying a beautiful but
strange rhythm. As the nine swords simultaneously struck out towards
Ning, they suddenly transformed into a single enormous blood-colored
greatsword. Clearly, the nine had joined together to become one,
resulting in them becoming dramatically more powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning emptied his mind
of all other thoughts as he used his six Violetjewels to executed the
‘Soleheart’ stance, transforming the six swords into six black
holes which he used to defend against the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s defenses were
instantly splintered and destroyed by the clash. He was immediately
blown backwards and sent flying, a deep gouge appearing in the earth.
This gouge was tens of thousands of kilometers long and many dozens
of meters deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face was
rather ashen. Not even Greatjoy, Solewind, or any of the others would
be able to crush him in such a manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unacceptable. I have
to counter-attack! If I just let him hammer away at me, I’ll
definitely lose this battle.” With a swoosh, Ning transformed into
a streak of light and charged forwards, his Yin-Yang Sword Domain
once more covering the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the Yin-Yang
Sword Domain, the azure-armored figure once more used the nine
blood-colored swords he was wielding to form a protective barrier of
sword-light that easily protected him from the domain. He raised his
head, giving Ning a cold look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes actually
lit up. “Although he’s able to resist my domain, he’s now
moving much slower than before. I, however, am still moving at my
normal speed.” Ning immediately transformed into as treak of light
that once more shot out towards the azure-armored figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had charged
to within just ninety meters of the azure-arored figure, he suddenly
vanished without a trace. Even his sword had completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Shadowless stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tchtchtchtch… streaks
of sword-light appeared, hidden within the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and
completely undetectable. They flew out as chops, slashes, and hacks
as they struck out towards the azure-armored figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The
azure-armored figure raised an eyebrow as the nine swords in his
hands trembled slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The protective barrier
of sword-light surrounding him began to oscillate, whittling away at
the power of Ning’s strikes before completely dispersing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While defending against
Ning’s attack, the azure-armored figure immediately launched an
attack of his own as he once more struck out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to run.” Ning
did his best to defend while retreating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” This
time, he was able to retreat with ease. Ning revealed a look of
delight. “If I seize the initiative to attack him, he’ll have to
focus his efforts on defending against me. When he switches to
attacks, he’ll be just a hair too slow and I’ll be able to
withdraw. I can’t let a foe like this seize the initiative in a
battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to attack
furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shadowless
sword-intent! It was incredibly ghostly and unpredictable, but the
rippling layers of sword-light surrounding the man were still able to
block all of Ning’s attacks, even though they shook while doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood Drop
sword-intent! These attacks possessed incredible penetrative power,
but it was a straightforward and above-boarod attack that the
opponent could prepare for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clashed against
this expert repeatedly. A chance to duel someone who had an Eternal
Emperor level of insight in the Dao of the Sword was incredibly
valuable
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some strange
reason, Ning continued to feel as though a spark of inspiration was
floating deep within his mind… but alas, he remained unable to
locate it no matter what he did. Now, the more he battled against the
opponent, the more he felt as though he was vaguely touching upon it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are these all the
techniques you have?” The azure-armored man suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was slightly
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How boring. You
haven’t even been able to truly merge your offensive Dao into your
defensive Dao.” The azure-armored figure let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! He finally made
his move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
the azure-armored figure’s speed suddenly and dramatically
increased. The nine blood-colored swords surrounding him transformed
into a curtain of sword-light, and the man himself transformed into
an enormous sword. If he previously moved through Ning’s domain
like a fish moving through water, he was now like a sword that simply
smashed through the domain with terrifying speed. He pounced at Ning,
moving far faster than Ning himself could. There was no way Ning
could dodge at all. Only now did he realize that his opponent hadn’t
used anything close to his real power earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!” The
azure-armored man and his nine swords, in the form of an enormous
greatsword, sliced downwards through the air and chopped directly
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no other
choices; all he could do was do his best to block the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world seemed to
break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
blown backwards. His six Eternal weapons were completely unable to
defend against this attack, and all of his stances collapsed at first
contact. In fact, two of his Violetjewels were actually knocked out
of his grip and sent flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground beneath him
shuddered as everything within a region of several hundred thousand
kilometers was reduced to dust by the shockwave ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lay there in the
giant crater, his fingers twitching numbly. He had been able to just
barely keep a hold over four of his Eternal weapons. The other two
had been knocked flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Receive my second
chop!” The azure-armored figure said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning actually had a
look of delight on his face… because he had finally realized what
that elusive flash of inspiration was. “The sword… in the end,
you can’t hold up a house on a single pillar of wood. It needs to
be part of a whole…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha… so that’s
how it is! I’m most skilled in defense, but my Soleheart stance has
been trapped in a bottleneck for some time now. I’ve come up with
two offensive Supreme Daos, but I haven’t been able to truly
upgrade my Soleheart stance. Haha…” Ning laughed. His talent for
defensive techniques was extremely high, and so he had reached a
bottleneck a long time ago during his journeys through the alternate
universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His offensive
techniques had improved nonstop, to the point where he had developed
two Supreme Daos for them. And yet, his Soleheart stance had come to
a screeching halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning first saw his
opponent utilize that barrier of sword-light, he had the vague
feeling that he had stumbled into a tremendous stroke of luck. Alas,
he wasn’t able to truly grasp what he was seeing. As the battle
progressed, Ning finally was able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single chopstick
can be easily snapped in half. An entire bundle of chopsticks is
almost impossible to chop.” Ning couldn’t help but laugh at
himself. Sometimes, this was how things worked. Once you were able to
see through to the true nature of things, you couldn’t help but
marvel at how simple the principle was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning’s
Soleheart stance wasn’t truly able to evolve into a Supreme Dao was
because his Soleheart stance was a single-target defensive technique.
Ning would use each of his swords to defend, and was able to use a
maximum of six swords in this manner at the same time. Each of the
six swords worked independently. Of course there was a limit to how
much power they could unleash! True, they were cooperating to a
certain extent and in the past, Ning had thought that they were
working ‘as one’, but now he realized he was wrong. When he saw
his opponent use that defensive sword-art, he realized what it truly
meant to be working ‘as one’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to do the same
thing, to truly fuse everything together. His opponent’s nine
blood-colored swords were able to easily merge together to form that
barrier of sword-light. When his opponent chose to attack, they were
able to easily merge together into an enormous greatsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was what ‘working
as one’ truly meant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soleheart stance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s hand swept
out, causing the two Eternal swords that had been knocked out of his
hands to come flying back to him at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Eternal swords
moved simultaneously, each of them exerting the Soleheart stance and
beginning to link together. Slowly, the six Eternal swords began to
transform and harmonize little by little. Ning had personally watched
his opponent use a similar technique and had clashed against him
multiple times, allowing Ning to learn some of the key elements. To
truly merge the stances together wasn’t as simple as to have all
six swords use the exact same stance. Rather, they had to be
responsible for different parts of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was much like how
a ‘complete’ man would have a nose, a mouth, two eyes, and other
body parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning furiously pulled
backwards, doing his best to stay away from his opponent as he tested
this new idea out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning’s six
swords suddenly transformed into a single black hole that completely
surrounded Ning, and at the edges of the black hole there was
something that looked like a rippling barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the true
Soleheart stance. This is finally something worth of being described
as a Supreme Dao of defense.” Ning revealed a smile. His Yin-Yang
Sword Domain was superb at dealing with groups of attackers, but the
Soleheart stance was much better for dealing with a single foe of
tremendous power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had finally
comprehended and mastered his Soleheart sword-intent, the fourth
sword-intent of his five stances of [Brightmoon]!

Chapter 30 – Stop Him!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!” The
azure-armored youth transformed into an enormous streak of
sword-light, forcibly shattering a path through Ji Ning’s Yin-Yang
Sword Domain. Ning couldn’t help but feel a sense of despair when
he gazed upon the sword-light. This was what happened when there was
a tremendous disparity in insight and comprehension. The sword-intent
of an Eternal Emperor… this really was completely unfair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
mentally shaken, he was still able to stay calm and alert as he
unleashed his six swords into the Soleheart sword-intent he had just
developed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a peacock
spreading its feathers, or like leaves swirling in the wind. The six
swords moved in unison like a perfect whole, naturally coming
together to form a terrifying black hole, with each of the swords
playing a specific role in the black hole’s creation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
figure’s terrifying sword-light chopped directly against that black
hole. Tchtchtch!!! Ning poured all of his power, comparable to that
of a Daolord of the First Step, into his new Soleheart sword-intent,
allowing it to unleash a simply terrifying level of force that
furiously ground away at his opponent’s stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His opponent’s
sword-light began to shudder and twist as it immediately began to
fall in power, causing the azure-armored figure to become visible
once more. At this moment, the azure-armored figure didn’t hesitate
at all, immediately choosing to retreat at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figure stood there
in the distance, staring at Ning with some surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I succeeded. This…
this is the true Soleheart stance.” Ning’s heart was filled with
joy. This was the true Soleheart stance he had wanted all along. Six
swords striking out in unison, as if they were a part of a single,
indivisible whole. If he fought anyone on the same level of power as
him, he would be able to completely shut down their attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even those who were
stronger than him and who had a higher level of insight into the Dao
would see their attacks dramatically weakened by this defensive
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The distant
azure-armored figure let out a cold snort. “Don’t get too smug.
You were only able to block me once thus far. Now… take a look at
my third chop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
azure-armored figure was quite physically weak, his sword-arts were
at a terrifyingly high level. Ning had to use all of his power to
deal with every single strike, and as a result he was able to
increasingly perfect his Soleheart stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two battled for the
amount of time needed to boil a kettle of tea, but the azure-armored
figure was still unable to do anything to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey kid. Tell me
your name.” The distant azure-armored figure suddenly spoke out in
an icy voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.”
Ning smiled as he spoke. He was naturally in a wonderful mood, now
that he had developed a new sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth? Mm.
You’ve reached the apex of perfection when it comes to defensive
prowess,” the azure-armored figure said. “When you have that
sword-intent domain active and spread out, I have to first endure its
power if I wish to attack you. This distracts me, resulting in me
only being able to unleash 60%-70% of my full power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Yin-Yang Sword
Domain was highly suited for dealing with group attacks! However, if
Ning was dealing with just a single opponent, it would also be highly
effective in entrapping and slowing that opponent down, making it so
that the opponent’s power lessened! The azure-armored figure needed
to constantly ward off the domain via his sword-arts, and so in
battle he was completely unable to unleash his full, peak power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And your
close-combat defensive skills are also quite formidable. When you
combine the two… even I am not able to defeat you.” The
azure-armored figure nodded. “I can’t kill you. You may leave
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
figure glanced sideways at Ning, his cold eyes the only thing visible
behind that mask he wore. ‘I can’t stop you, which means you can
proceed to the next level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what about the
nine swords which your master left behind, senior?” Ning couldn’t
help but ask this question. These were the swords left behind by an
Eternal Emperor! Ning had witnessed for himself the terrible power
which each sword contained; there was no way any ordinary Eternal
weapon could possibly be a match for them. Moreover, when used
together they would probably gain certain other special powers as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually plan on
taking my master’s nine swords?” The azure-armored figure
smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I certainly wouldn’t
decline them if you were willing to give them to me,” Ning said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said, if you
kill me you will win the nine swords which Master left behind.” The
azure-armored figure continued coldly, “Although I can’t kill
you, you can’t kill me either. This naturally means you are not
worthy of acquiring Master’s nine swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
azure-armored figure dove into the ground, disappearing without a
trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was fast.”
Ning couldn’t help but laugh. “Was it really necessary for him to
run away that fast? It’s not like I’m able to take those swords
away from him by force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
figure had truly been quite terrifying. His attacks were much
stronger than Ning’s, and he was significantly faster as well.
Thankfully, Ning had the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and his Soleheart
stance, two exceedingly strong defensive techniques, which he was
able to use to ward off this tough foe. This was the reason why Ning
had survived this trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
drilled the ground as well, passing through it to the next, deeper
level and the abyss-world it contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to go
downwards through the levels of the Abyss of Fiends. The next few
levels were quite simple, as he only had to deal with a few
fiendlords. And so, just like that, he made it to the twenty-fourth
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the twenty-fourth
level, he saw a prominently placed blood-colored estate. Before the
estate stood the azure-armored figure, and there was an entire group
of fiendlords which surrounded the estate, all of whom appeared to
revere the azure-armored figure greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings again,
senior.” Ning flew over then bowed towards the azure-armored
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
azure-armored figure nodded, then pointed to an enormous vortex off
in the distance. “That over there is the exit tunnel. You can pass
through it to reach the outside world. For you to have made it to the
twenty-fourth level is already quite impressive. If you choose to
leave now, you’ll earn one of my master’s treasures as well as
one of his sword-art legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure?” Ning
asked, “Is it one of the swords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is not.” The
azure-armored figure glanced sideways at Ning. “Those nine swords
were my master’s most important treasures, and they will be given
to his true successor. You? I suppose you could just barely qualify
as an honorary disciple. I’ll give you one of the various random
treasures which Master had on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, “Senior,
isn’t it true that the Abyss of Fiends has a total of thirty-six
levels? I’m only at the twenty-fourth level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, you want to
keep going downwards?” The azure-armored figure smiled coldly. “The
lower levels are far more dangerous. Be satisfied with one of my
master’s treasures and a sword-art legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. He
had experienced many hardships in order to travel to this alternate
universe, including ten thousand years of wandering before even
reaching the Genesi Lands! Was he supposed to just leave after merely
becoming an honorary disciple of an Eternal Emperor? Ning would have
agreed if the man had been willing to give him those nine swords, as
a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, but for one of the
random treasures the Eternal Emperor had been carrying?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had acquired an
enormous amount of darkspace flamestones. He really didn’t care
about other treasures. In addition, Emperor Mirrorsnow had given Ning
four incredibly valuable golems! The ‘random’ treasures of this
deceased Eternal Emperor probably wouldn’t be worth that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I choose to
continue,” Ning said. “I’ll head downwards now, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning
transformed into a streak of light and disappeared without a trace.
His Shadowless evasion skill allowed him to easily pass downwards to
the next level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid…” The
azure-armored figure frowned as he watched Ning drill downwards.
“He’s too self-confident. He insists on going down a path of no
return, and I can’t even stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The
azure-armored figure immediately disappeared as well, moving far
faster than Ning had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-first level
of the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was a place
of incredible beauty, filled with singing birds and fragrant flowers.
There were no devils here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed man was
seated at the peak of a towering mountain, a triad of gold-hilted,
white-hilted, and violet-hilted swords on his back. He sat there in
the lotus position, gazing upon this vast, beautiful world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second brother.” A
voice rang out. Moments later, the azure-armored figure appeared out
of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother. Long
time no see.” The white-robed man smiled. “Why have you suddenly
come to visit me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I met this kid. He
really is quite talented in the Dao of the Sword, and I did exactly
as Master instructed. I held nothing back, but I still wasn’t able
to kill him.” The azure-armored figure shook his head. “I had a
good opinion of him. I felt the kid had a lot of potential, and was
good enough to become one of my master’s honorary disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even you could
kill him?” The white-robed man revealed a smile. “Not bad! It is
rare for us to encounter such a talented figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he insists on
going deeper,” the azure-armored man said impatiently. “He
obviously doesn’t care about becoming my master’s honorary
disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I bet he’d listen
to you if you were willing to give him those nine swords,” the
white-robed man teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
figure said angrily, “All Master really had were those nine swords.
I absolutely won’t give them to anyone until I find the perfect
successor for him. This kid isn’t bad, but he’s not even close to
being the ideal candidate I’ve been hoping for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
shook his head. “Well, if he insists on going downwards… what am
I supposed to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him, second
brother. Stop him and make him go back,” the azure-armored figure
said immediately. “The thirty-sixth level was left behind by the
Hegemon personally, just before he died. You know how terrifyingly
dangerous it is! Over the course of countless years, there have been
a number of self-confident geniuses who refused to listen to me and
insisted on going all the way down… and all of them died there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the white-robed
man thought of the thirty-sixth level, he couldn’t help but frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their Hegemon had
personally created that place. It was the most mysterious and most
terrifying place in the entire Abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their Hegemon was such
an incredibly strong figure that even their masters, those two
Eternal Emperors of the Dao of the Sword, were willing to serve as
his retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. I’ll do my
best to stop him, but if I fail… there’ll be nothing else I can
do,” the white-robed man said.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning quickly fought
his way to the thirty-first floor of the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Thus far, the
Abyss had been a place filled with baleful auras and negative energy.
Ning couldn’t help but feel somewhat flabbergasted upon suddenly
encountering a level that was filled with flowers and birds, a level
which was almost like an otherworldly paradise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed man
drifted towards Ning from afar, bearing three swords on his back; one
violet-hilted, one gold-hilted, and one white-hilted. He emanated an
ephemeral, drifting aura which was similar to that of the clouds in
the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A serious look
immediately appeared on Ning’s face. Him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three grandmasters of
the Dao of the Sword had perished outside. The muscular man who
wielded that deep blue greatsword was the leader, while the other two
Eternal Emperors were his retainers. One was dressed in azure armor,
while the other looked just like this white-robed man before Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Appearance, bearing,
sword-aura… everything was identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” The
white-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
Ning bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man had
a warm look in his eyes as he carefully scrutinized Ning, then
smiled. “For you to be able to make it past my second brother means
that you are probably quite strong. Unfortunately for you, I’m not
my second brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he drew
forth the violet sword and the golden sword from his back. As for the
white sword, it automatically unsheathed itself and transformed into
a streak of white light that floated next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, senior.”
Ning’s body blurred as he manifested his [Three Heads, Six Arms],
then drew his six Violetjewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce light flashed
through Ning’s eyes as his Dao lightning and Dao water immediately
burst forth, roaring through the skies and covering an area of ten
thousand kilometers around them. The white-robed man was standing
fairly close to Ning and was naturally wrapped up within this as
well. The lightning-water Yin-Yang Sword Domain possessed truly
remarkable amounts of power, and it constantly launched attacks
against that white-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
just stood there, not moving at all. And yet, the blurry sword-light
emanating from around his body was like a cloud or a mist that easily
absorbed and repelled all oncoming attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Not good.”
Ning’s heart sank. “The azure-armored man had needed to use those
physical nine swords to form a barrier of sword-light to protect him
from my domain, but this white-robed man… the light from his
sword-intent alone is enough for him to easily defend against me.
Clearly, his defensive prowess is far superior to the azure-armored
man’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s guess was
correct!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man’s
specialty lay in attack, in slaughter! Ning had two Supreme Daos of
defense, the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and Soleheart sword-intent, and
only by combining them was he able to withstand the onslaught. This
was a testament to how ferocious the azure-armored man’s attacks
were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, the
white-robed man seemed much calmer and gentler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Emperor Sword.”
The white-robed man instantly transformed into a streak of light as
he chopped out towards Ning with the violet sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an ephemeral,
unpredictable chop, but it was so fast that it caused Ning’s heart
to be gripped in ice. It was simply too fast. His opponent wasn’t
even as strong as an ordinary World God was, but his sword was simply
incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly executed
his Soleheart sword-intent, manifesting a black hole which had
flickers of sword-light swiveling inside of it. He used this stance
to defend against the opponent’s chop. It was a good decision. The
power contained within the black hole was simply too enormous,
allowing it to block the opponent’s lethal attack head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Killsword.”
The white-robed man spoke out once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. This time, he
struck out with the golden sword which he wielded in his left hands.
The sword carried an aura of incredible sharpness as it pierced
straight towards Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stab was actually
somewhat similar to Ning’s own Blood Drop stance. However, it was a
strike formed from the sword-intent of an Eternal Emperor. When the
golden sword struck out, it carried an aura of such terrifying
sharpness and destructive power that Ning couldn’t help but
shudder. However, Ning knew that although the sword-intent itself
caused him to uncontrollably shake in fear, the person using it was
so incredibly weak that he probably wasn’t even at the World level
in strength. This enormous disparity in physical power was enough to
let Ning make a fight out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. He once more
used the Soleheart stance to form that black hole. Sword-light once
more swiveled and circled within that black hole, allowing him to
once more forcibly block his opponent’s terrifying attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your defensive
techniques truly are incredible.” The white-robed man shook his
head and smiled. “As I expected… for you to be able to withstand
my third brother means that my own attacks stand even less of a
chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
superior to his third brother in overall power, his third brother was
still stronger in raw attack power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are able to
defeat my third sword, I won’t try to stop you,” the white-robed
man said. The violet sword and golden sword in his hands began to
move at the same time… and as for the most important sword of all,
that streak of white light that had been hovering around him? It
instantly vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet sword and
the golden sword emanated dazzling amounts of light, putting the sun
in the skies to shame with their omnipresent radiance. It was like an
enormous gauzy cloak of light had covered the entire world,
completely covering Ji Ning within its perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The Dao
lightning and Dao water continued to rage around Ning, but himself
disappeared without a trace as well. He had just used the Shadowless
stance. When he next appeared, he was directly in front of that
violet-golden gauze of light, and he furiously struck out with his
six Violetjewels against the gauze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streaks of white
light suddenly appeared out of nowhere in front of the gauze, easily
blocking Ning’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning felt as
though he had just chopped down upon a cloud or a layer of mist.
There was nothing for him to exert his power against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
it.” Ning once more struck out with his Shadowless stance,
launching another silent sneak-attack at another area. Alas, as soon
as his attack was about to collide against the violet-golden canopy,
streaks of white light once again appeared from the surface of the
gauze. The white light was ethereal and ephemeral, giving Ning no way
to exert his full force upon it, causing his attacks to fail
repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
covered by that gauze canopy of violet-gold light, and the streaks of
white light hidden within the canopy rendered Ning’s attacks
completely fruitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, well done,
second brother! You were able to easily trap that young fellow.”
The azure-armored figure appeared off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Master knew that
I was using his most powerful killing technique, the Void Sword Realm
to simply trap a foe… he’d probably be so insulted that he’d
wipe me out.” The white-robed man’s figure appeared within the
violet-golden canopy. When he used this technique, he completely
merged himself into the canopy of light itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the Void Sword
Realm, an extremely terrifying sword technique. It was definitely on
par with Emperor Mirrorsnow’s most powerful strike, the Heartseal
stance. Alas, the white-robed figure was merely using it with Elder
God level power, making it much weaker. It was just barely capable of
trapping a genius like Ning, who was comparable to a Daolord of the
Second Step! If an Eternal Emperor used this technique, the entire
violet-gold canopy would become completely ethereal, and it would be
simplicity itself to use this technique to cover an entire territory!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, an
incomparably sharp streak of sword-light pierced out from within the
violet-gold canopy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” A hint of
shock could be heard in the white-robed man’s voice. “How could
he be able to pierce through my Void Sword Realm?! Third brother, why
does he have such a terrifyingly strong sword-art?” The white-robed
man roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?! He does have an
extremely strong sword-art that carries tremendous destructive,
penetrative power,” the azure-armored man said hurriedly. “Even I
have to face that attack head-on in order to block it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!” The
white-robed man grew furious and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void Sword Realm
created an ethereal world which was unmoved by raw power. It could
completely absorb even the most savage of strikes! Although the
Shadowless stance of Ning’s [Brightmoon] sword-arts was rather
strange, it simply wasn’t strong enough to overcome the world’s
defenses. As for the Soleheart stance or the Yin-Yang Sword Domain,
they were defensive techniques. But the Blood Drop stance… this was
Ning’s most penetrating attack of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Ning did come
up with a Heavenbreaker sword-intent in the future, his Blood Drop
stance would still have the greatest penetrative power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an attack which
destroyed everything in its path, which pierced through all things
which sought to bar its way!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void Sword Realm
wasn’t truly perfect and flawless. Perhaps only someone on the
level of a Hegemon would be able to make it truly perfect… and its
one weakness was to attacks that had tremendous penetrative power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning discovered
that his Blood Drop stance was the perfect counter to the violet-gold
gauze before him, he struck out three times in a row. His stabs
blasted a hole through the canopy before him, and he immediately
transformed into a streak of light and flew out of that hole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
violet-gold canopy instantly disappeared, transforming back into that
white-robed man. The three swords the man had been using all flew
back into the sheaths he was carrying on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
stared at Ning, a complicated look in his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop stance
truly was the perfect counter to the Void Sword Realm. But of course,
at present Ning’s Blood Drop stance was still rather raw and
unpolished; the only reason it had succeeded was because the
white-robed man’s level of power was limited to the Elder God
level. Still, if Ning ever reached the Eternal Emperor level and was
able to upgrade his Blood Drop stance to that level as well, he would
be able to use it to defeat the Void Sword Realm as used by the
Eternal Emperor who had created it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a counter
and a complement for every sword-art.” The white-robed man sighed.
“You were actually able to come up with a sword-art that perfectly
countered mine. I truly don’t know if this was a blessing or a
curse for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
distant azure-armored figure spoke out as well. “Both my second
brother and I wish for you to stop here. You truly are quite
talented. We really don’t want to see you throwing your life away
on the thirty-sixth floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Throwing my life
away?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
said, “Just listen to me. My sword-arts and my second brother’s
sword-arts all come from our respective masters. Although our masters
were Eternal Emperors, they weren’t at the Hegemon level. Master’s
sword-arts were never truly perfected, but the Hegemon’s… his
sword-arts were truly perfect and without flaw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are skilled in
defense, making it so that I can do nothing against you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-arts
possess tremendous penetrative power, allowing you to defeat the Void
Sword Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if you were to
go to the thirty-sixth level, you will realize that your sword-arts
are all completely useless.” The azure-armored man shook his head.
“You’ll die in despair! Over the course of countless ages, there
have been quite a few monstrously talented World-level geniuses who
were able to make it past myself and my second brother, but all of
them died on the thirty-sixth floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
What?! There had been multiple individuals who had made it past the
azure-armored man and the white-robed man, only to die on the
thirty-sixth level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I urge you to give
up,” the white-robed man said. “If you go back now, you can
return to the exit tunnel on the twenty-fourth floor. I’ll give you
one of my own master’s treasures as well! I’ll also transmit my
master’s sword-arts legacy to you.”

Chapter 32 – The Thirty-Sixth Level of the Abyss of Fiends
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
also viewed Ji Ning with great favor. Although there had been other
geniuses who had been able to make their way deep into the Abyss of
Fiends, he could count on one hand the number of geniuses who had
been able to force their way path both himself and his third brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both he and his third
brother wished for Ji Ning to become honorary disciples of their two
masters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure? And just
‘honorary’ disciple?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
white-robed man nodded. “According to master’s instructions… he
will accept one personal disciple and six honorary disciples.
Although I like you, you aren’t even close to meeting the standard
necessary to become Master’s personal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt rather
disappointed. Still, he understood that because these three Eternal
Emperors were already deceased, they would be extremely careful in
selecting their legacy disciples. Emperor Mirrorsnow was still alive;
even though he was taking on a total of ten personal disciples, every
single disciple would only be given a set of four Daolord golems.
These three Eternal Emperors, however, were giving all of their most
important treasures to a single personal disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you at least
tell me what the thirty-sixth level holds?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our masters once
followed and served our Hegemon,” the azure-armored figure growled.
“Do you know what the exalted title of ‘Hegemon’ means? It
means that they are able to rule over all other things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Of course
he knew. The Brightshore Kingdom had a Hegemon. His entire homeland
of the Endless Territories only had three Hegemons in total!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To inherit
everything a Hegemon left behind… ahaha! I once encountered someone
who was even more talented than you in the Dao of the Sword. He had
perfectly merged his offenses and his defenses into a truly perfect
whole.” The azure-armored figure sighed. “I was willing to let
him become my master’s personal disciple, but he was too proud. He
chose to go the thirty-sixth level instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
Apparently, that genius of the Dao of the Sword was on the same level
as Bertulu and Eastcult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he still died on
that level.” The azure-armored figure shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give up.” The
white-robed man looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should he give up? Even
those more talented tham him had perished on the thirty-sixth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Hegemon’s legacy
lies there… the legacy of someone who was on the same level as the
almighty Hegemon of the Brightshore Kingdom.” Ning’s eyes slowly
began to blaze with resolve and a desire to fight. “Why have I left
the Three Realms and braved the dangers of the Endless Territories?
Why have I chosen to gon on so many deadly adventures? It is all for
the sake of being able to bring her back to life! I dream of the day
when the three of us… her, me, and Brightmoon… will once more be
able to live together as a family.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s deepest desire
was to bring his entire family back again. It was this stubborn
desire which kept him going, which made him strive so hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To reverse the flows
of spacetime and bring her back to life will be incredibly difficult.
If I let myself be filled with fear, I probably won’t be able to
make it to the apex of power and won’t be able to convince someone
like the Hegemon to bring her back the life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s more…
even if I fail my attempt at the thirty-sixth level, I’ll merely
lose one of my clones. I can rebuild it eventually.” All hesitation
vanished from Ning’s gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to charge
straight down his path. No one would be able to stop him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” The
white-robed man and the azure-armored figure both looked at Ning,
awaiting his decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive me,
seniors.” Ning murmured softly, “I still wish to continue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What if you die? You
won’t regret it?” The white-robed man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No regrets,” Ning
replied. He then transformed into a streak of light and tore through
the ground, diving through to the next level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
and the white-robed man both let out long sighs as they watched Ning
leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew he would
choose this path. Every single person who has developed their own
Supreme Dao is filled with terrifyingly strong resolve,” the
white-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, fortuitous
occurrences were external sources of power. When the strong rose to
power, it was the stubborn will and resolve in their heart which
drove them to continue forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you didn’t have an
almost insanely stubborn desire to accomplish a certain something, it
was virtually impossible for you to be able to stand at the apex of
power in this vast universe. Even if you were incredibly talented and
had many tremendous strokes of luck, if you didn’t have a
terrifyingly amount of determination there was no way you’d be able
to make it to the top.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An infatuation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A longing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of emotions
could be transformed into a determined will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. He’ll
probably die on this path he has chosen. But if he doesn’t die,
he’ll definitely become one of the most dazzlingly talented figures
in this vast universe, someone who countless other cultivators will
willingly submit to,” the azure-armored figure said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued
downwards through the various levels. These levels in the Abyss only
contained fiendlords. In the end, Ning managed to make it all the way
to the thirty-sixth level, the deepest level of the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
gracefully in midair, staring at this bottommost level of the Abyss
of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gugugu…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world of
volcanos, and Ning was able to see three towering volcanos located in
three different parts of this world. Each of the volcanos
continuously belched out plumes of fire and lava which flowed out
throughout this world. Due to the terrifying degree of heat, the
bubbling lava would continue to bubble and hiss for a very long
period of time before slowly solidifying into volcanic rock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Where’s the
exit tunnel? Why isn’t there an exit tunnel on this level?” Ning
was searching for the exit tunnel for this level, but was able to
find nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the earth
began to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately turned
his gaze off into the distance. The vast earth, covered with flowing
streams of lava, was shaking. Slowly, the earth began to split apart
as an ancient, towering shrine began to gradually emerge from
underground. The shrine was a deep blue color, and it was covered
with strange diagrams. In front of the shrine stood a towering
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering figure
stood there silently, hands clasped around a deep blue greatsword. He
stared at Ning from afar, and his gaze alone made Ning feel as though
an entire world was crashing down upon him. That stare alone made
Ning feel as though this man was absolutely invincible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? His aura is
absolutely identical to that Hegemon’s aura.” Ning remained very
calm and composed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another challenger
has come?” The muscular man standing in front of the shrine glanced
at Ning, his eyes extremely cold and calm. He said in a flat voice,
“Kill him, children.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him, children.”
His deep voice boomed throughout every inch of this world, echoing
again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned upon
hearing this. ‘Children’? But it didn’t seem as though the
thirty-sixth level had any other living beings within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three booming voices
instantly burst forth from within the three towering volcanos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those massive volcanos
actually began to move, and as they moved they quickly began to
transform into similarly towering volcano titans! All three volcanos
had transformed into three enormous volcano titans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three volcano
titans had pitch-black forms, but Ning could sense the blazing,
flaming power which filled their bodies. Their eyes were flowing
pools of lava, and every single one of them seemed to possess the
power of an enormous world. Just looking at them, Ning felt certain
that they were far physically stronger than he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the three volcano
titans appeared, they first turned towards the distant, muscular,
grim-faced man who stood in front of the shrine. All three went down
to one knee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Only then
did the three volcano titans rise to their feet and charge towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their galloping paces
caused the earth to tremble. They left enormous footsteps in the
ground, and their glares made Ning feel rather startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But so what if they
are strong? From the looks of them, they are special lifeforms that
were formed from or out of volcanos,” Ning mused. “They are
probably much weaker than me in terms of insights into the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning manifested three
heads and six arms, then drew his six Eternal swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven streams of
Dao water and Dao lightning all surged forth, filling an area of ten
thousand kilometers with sword-light formed from lightning and water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The volcano titan
closest to Ning charged into Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain. Although
sword-light repeatedly hacked down upon his volcanic form, the
attacks were only able to leave behind a few white marks on its rocky
skin. It barely paused at all, not slowed in the slightest as it
continued to charge forwards with heavy steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wanted to see
exactly how physically strong these volcano titans were, and so he
first chose to fight it in a head-on clash through using his most
penetratively powerful attack, the Blood Drop stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streaks of
sword-light shot out like an enormous meteor shower that shot out
towards that terrifying stone hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The giant stone
hand howled as it flew through the air. It crushed the six streaks of
sword-light, then slammed directly onto Ning. This time, it was Ning
who was knocked flying backwards like a meteor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew backwards,
he forcibly twisted himself upright and landed on the ground. The
earth shudder from the collision, caving in for an area of a million
kilometers as an enormous basis suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet,
his face rather ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single volcano
titan is already this much stronger than me… and there are three?
And these are just the ‘children’?” Ning finally could sense
that death was approaching. Finally, he realized why no one had ever
been able to survive the thirty-sixth level.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The other
two volcano titans howled as they charged forwards, each seeming just
as valiant and mighty as the first. Their thunderous steps were as
heavy as the mountains, but they moved faster than the limits of the
Heavenly Daos. Although each of their punches and strikes seemed
rather ungainly to Ji Ning, they carried enough power to truly
overmatch him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
I can’t even take care of the three ‘children’.” Ning’s
body constantly blurred, disappearing and reappearing thanks to the

agility to throw out rope treasures and other treasures to slow down
his foes.

white-robed man and the azure-armored man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
white-robed man and the azure-armored man both spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The muscular
man acknowledged them calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The kid’s able to
hold his own against the combined attacks of three volcano titans. He
really isn’t bad.” The azure-armored figure glanced at the
distant Ning, then smiled. “Big brother, would you agree that this
kid is worth us spending some effort teaching?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man said
coldly, “Far from it. He’s merely relying on a few defensive
tricks to stay alive. Once my children unleash their ultimate
attacks, he’ll definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you just going
to watch him die?” The white-robed man asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He might’ve
developed two offensive Supreme Daos and two defensive Supreme Daos,
but so what?” The muscular man said coldly, “He hasn’t been
able to truly join them together… he’s not even worth me giving
advice to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
and the white-robed man exchanged a glance, then shook their heads
helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, you
really have set your expectations too high. Remember that guy, all
those years ago, who had perfectly fused his offensive Dao and his
defensive Dao? You ended up personally kill him!” The azure-armored
man muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. That’s
because he was too stupid. I personally gave him pointers on what to
do, but he still wasn’t able to improve at all. He deserved to
die.” The muscular man continued, “And even if he did have a
so-called flawless union of an offensive Supreme Dao and defensive
Supreme Dao, what of it? It must be understood that advancing
forwards on such a path is incredibly difficult. Each step will be
taxing, and the final step of completing the Daomerge and gaining
eternity will be unspeakably arduous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over the course of
countless years I’ve seen many dazzlingly talented figures who, as
Daolords of the Fourth Step, were capable of killing weaker Eternal
Emperors. Almost none of them, however, are capable of succeeding in
their Daomerge and gaining the power of a Hegemon.” The muscular
man shook his head. “Master is already dead. He can only accept a
single personal disciple and two honorary disciples. There’s only
three slots total. I have to be incredibly cautious when doling them
out. Even an honorary disciple has to be both a perfect candidate as
well as have a Dao which is very similar to my master’s Dao. As for
becoming a personal disciple? Only someone who can receive the
acknowledgment of my master’s Eternal weapon and make it
voluntarily wish to serve him is qualified be given that position!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really do have
high expectations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excessively high
expectations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man and
the azure armored man both shook their heads. After their masters had
perished, they had only met a single genius who had been able to
truly and perfectly merge an offensive Supreme Dao and a defensive
Supreme Dao… and in the end, the muscular man had personally killed
him! He hadn’t even been willing to hand over a position of
honorary disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master decided to
only accept two honorary disciples. I’m willing to bet that the
personal disciples of the leader of the Church of Annihilation are
given less than my master has prepared for his two honorary
disciples,” the muscular man said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the term
‘disciple’ was just a titular one. What really mattered was what
the teacher and master had prepared! There was only so much a living
Hegemon would give; there was no way he would bestow his most
important treasures to someone else. Only a dead Hegemon would be so
truly selfless as to hand over all of his treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three volcano
titans stood in three different directions as they surrounded and
attacked Ning. Ning no longer dared to face them head-on, as the
volcano titans possessed overwhelming levels of brute strength.
Worse, he was completely incapable of damaging their volcanic bodies.
Not even his Blood Drop stance could punch through them! For now, he
could only rely on his Soleheart sword-intent to buy himself some
time. Ning also used his rope-type magic treasures to try and tie
down one of the volcano titans. Ning believed this to be his only
method for capturing and subduing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They used the most
elementary, simple of attacks. Sometimes, they would swing their
giant rocky hands. Other times, they would raise their fists high in
the air, then smash downwards towards the ground. Every so often,
they would bring both arms to their chests, then make a sudden
pushing motion towards Ning. The attacks were simple but filled with
speed and savagery, causing Ning to be at a complete disadvantage in
this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Although they
use similar techniques, it seems as though there are some
differences.” Ning realized that there was something off with these
three volcano titans. One of them was faster and more explosive while
the second always attacked with both hands. As for the third, he was
the slowest of the three; he would spend quite a bit of time building
up power before each attack, but the attacks he unleashed were
incomparably devastating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although their
attacks aren’t exactly the same, they seem to share certain
similarities.” Ning was slowly mesmerized by the possibilities.
From their attacks, he was able to see some of the things he himself
had been searching for but unable to truly master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, as the battle
continued Ning began to gain a few insights into the various battle
stances that the three volcano titans used. But of course, he was
only able to gain a few. The three volcano titans were very crude in
using these techniques, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenbreaker
stance…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the only
stance remaining was the Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five stances of
[Brightmoon]. He had already developed Supreme Daos based on the
other four stances. Only the Heavenbreaker stance was left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenbreaker
stance was the most ferocious of stances, containing truly wild and
berserk levels of power. It used overwhelming power to crush all foes
and was Ning’s most physically powerful attack. It was the perfect
solution for dealing with foes whose defenses simply couldn’t be
pierced through or penetrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance
focused on being fluctuating and unpredictable; this naturally caused
the power of the actual attacks to be somewhat weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop stance
destroyed everything in its path, letting it pierce through all which
would oppose it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two stances had
both reached the apex in their respective fields… but both had made
sacrifices in terms of total, raw power! Only by focusing in one area
could one reach the apex in that area, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenbreaker
stance didn’t have a terrifying penetrative ability, nor was it
unpredictable in the slightest. It was simply an awesome, direct
attack that contained the strongest levels of power possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm… ah! Is that
how it is?” Ning’s battle against the three volcano titans grew
increasingly frenzied, and he continued to secretly learn from their
striking techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This furious battle
persisted for roughly the amount of time needed to boil a kettle of
tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for the final
attack.” The distant azure-armored figure and white-robed figure
both let out soft sighs. They had grown accustomed to seeing this
long ago. The strongest attack which these three volcano titans had
was actually a single attack that was combined from three different
attacks. Once they joined together to form the final attack, they
would be able to unleash the most powerful killing strike they were
capable of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of that
attack was terrifyingly great! If you did not have a truly perfect
Dao, it was all but guaranteed that you would perish from it. And
even if you did have a perfect Dao… it was likely that their ‘big
brother’ would personally attack and kill you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling
furiously for the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, the movements
of the three volcano titans suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! One of the
volcano titans suddenly lifted up his enormous stone hands, preparing
to slam downwards towards Ning. The second volcano titan slowly
advanced, both hands in front of his chest as he prepared to make a
shoving motion. The final volcano titan began to prepare to swing his
arms towards Ning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rhythm of the
battle had changed. The attacks of the three volcano titans had
joined together to form a whole, and the power of their attacks
actually began to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood what he was seeing. This was much like how he perfectly
merged his six Eternal swords together when using the Soleheart
sword-intent. In this moment, the three volcano titans had truly
merged together, and the power of this attack would definitely be ten
times greater than their previous ones. Ning had already been at a
complete disadvantage. For their attack power to increase tenfold…
he was going to get crushed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AH!” Ning’s eyes
suddenly lit up. “T-this… this is how the Heavenbreaker stance
should be!” A look of wild joy suddenly appeared within his eyes as
he stared at the three volcano titans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the three
volcano titans were using one of the techniques which the Hegemon had
developed. This technique was 70%-80% similar to Ning’s
Heavenbreaker stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had watched
and sparred with the volcano titans, he had gained a number of new
insights. Given that his Heavenbreaker stance had already reached a
bottleneck and only needed one final push to break through to a new
level… once the three volcano titans joined forces, Ning suddenly
understood it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A warhorse needed
enough space to gallop before it could reach its maximum velocity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bow needed to be
drawn to a full arc before it would reach maximum power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hints of the truth to
this Dao could be seen throughout the mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenbreaker
stance… if you wanted to release the full, terrifying level of
power it contained, you would need to first build up power! For
example, in archery you would build up power by drawing your bow…
and then let it explode forth with its full might, like a volcano
erupting! Only by building up enough might would you be able to
unleash the full power of your attack! But just as importantly, the
moment you unleashed your power had to be fast, fierce, and
compressed into a short instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This… this was what a
Heavenbreaker stance should look like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenbreaker.”
Ning made his move. He raised all six of his arms high into the air,
filling his Violetjewels with his divine power and causing them to
instantly skyrocket in weight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten times. Ten thousand
times. A trillion times…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Violetjewels
each became as heavy as a chaos star! This was approaching the
maximum level of weight which Ning was currently able to control. The
Heavenbreaker stance was ideally executed with extremely heavy
weapons, such as the deep blue greatsword of the deceased Hegemon.
That was actually an incredibly dense and unique weapon which was
perfect for using the Heavenbreaker stance.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_34___Sword_Dao_Samsara"></A>
Chapter 34 – Sword Dao Samsara
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s six
Violetjewels all chopped towards his opponents at the same time, and
as they moved forwards they crushed everything in their path, causing
space itself to tremble and distort. They moved forwards in seemingly
slow arcs, but their power only continued to grow until they reached
a crescendo of might, then slammed head-on into the giant stone fists
of a volcano titan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power now contained
with every single one of Ning’s six swords was stronger than when
he previously used all six swords combined to execute the Blood Drop
stance. This was the difference between the Heavenbreaker stance and
the Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of penetrative
power, the Blood Drop stance was far superior to the Heavenbreaker
stance… but it was still useless against these volcano titans, who
had bodies that were comparable to precious treasures. But in terms
of raw power, the Heavenbreaker stance was similarly far superior to
the Blood Drop stance. It was perfect for head-on clashes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous volcanic
body of the volcano titan shuddered violently, and he couldn’t help
but stumble back quite a few steps. Even his giant stone hands were
visibly trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was clearly much
faster and more agile than the volcano titans. He only had to deal
with one of them each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of explosions
rang out as the towering volcano titans were knocked stumbling
backwards one by one, thanks to Ning’s overwhelming power. Although
the volcano titans bellowed furiously and charged forwards
repeatedly, Ning was able to beat them back each time. Ning was
physically much smaller than them, but the power of his Heavenbreaker
stance allowed him to completely outstrip them and shut them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” An odd,
surprised look appeared on the formerly emotionless face of the
muscular, greatsword-wielding man who stood in front of the distant
shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?!” The
white-robed man and the azure-armored man next to him both revealed
looks of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, that
Sword Dao… isn’t that just like the Dao of the Hegemon, a Dao
that overwhelms and crushes all foes in a straightforward manner?”
The azure-armored man saif hurriedly, “Darknorth is a perfect fit
for learning the Hegemon’s Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man calmly
shook his head. “Although he’s developed five Supreme Daos, he
hasn’t been able to link them together in a perfect manner. He’s
not even qualified to become my master’s honorary disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased Hegemon
would only accept one personal disciple and two honorary disciples.
Not even that now-deceased World-level genius who had perfectly fused
an offensive Supreme Dao with a defensive Supreme Dao had been able
to qualify as an honorary disciple. In fact, the muscular man had
personally slaughtered him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, your
requirements are too stringent. The Sword Dao this kid has come up
with is extremely similar to that of the Hegemon’s,” the
azure-armored man said frantically. “There are incredibly few such
geniuses of the Dao of the Sword. If you kill him, who knows how long
it will be before we encounter another one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d rather have no
successors at all than poor ones.” The muscular man shook his head.
“If I am to choose a successor, I will only choose a perfect one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A perfect one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, you…
ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man and
the azure-armored man both shook their heads. But right then, both
their bodies trembled. Even the muscular man was somewhat astonished
as he stared at what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
white-robed man and the azure-armored man called out this word at the
same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he have
made yet another breakthough so quickly?” A look of true
astonishment was on the muscular man’s cold features as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning developed
the Heavenbreaker stance, he immediately found the battle against the
three volcano titans was now much easier than before. Thanks to the
Shadowless evasive skill and the Blood Drop evasive skill, he was far
more agile than his opponents. Defending was inherently easier than
attacking, but now his attacks carried crushing power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an absolutely
delightful feeling. But just as Ning was battling to his heart’s
content, he suddenly had the vague feeling that his five
sword-intents could actually be linked together in some manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…” Ning
suddenly realized that there were certain aspects of his five
sword-intents that resonated with each other and attracted each
other. They made up for each other’s weaknesses, and in fact it
could be said they all stemmed from the same source.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was
awesomely vast, different aspects of it could lead to different
directions of development. Ning’s starting point was the essence of
the sword itself, and he had divided it up into five different
aspects that he believed included all types of sword-arts the Dao of
the Sword could contain. His five aspects were the Blood Drop
sword-intent, the Shadowless sword-intent, the Heavenbreaker
sword-intent, the Yin-Yang sword-intent, and the Soleheart
sword-intent. These five types of sword-intent, when separated
thusly, truly did encompass all possible elements and aspects of all
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five types of
sword-intents were, in truth, five parts of the complete Dao of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had developed
his first, second, third, and fourth sword-intents, he hadn’t
realized this. But now that he had developed his fifth sword-intent,
this battle instantly caused him to realize that there were deep,
inextricable connections between his five sword-intents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five
sword-intents can be completely joined together.” And so, Ning
naturally began to do just that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was unlike all other
geniuses. Bertulu, Eastcult, Prince Greatjoy… they hadn’t
actually truly understood or mastered all aspects of their chosen
paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastcult had merely
come up with a single offensive Dao and a single defensive Dao. When
he managed to join them together in a perfect manner, his power
increased dramatically! But of course, joining together two Supreme
Daos was incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
Prince Greatjoy. He too had only comprehended a pair of Supreme Daos,
eventually joining them together here in the Genesis Lands of this
alternate universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Bertulu, he was
a bit stronger than the other two, having mastered and joined
together a trio of Supreme Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Imagine a porcelain
plate which had been shattered into five bizarrely-shaped pieces.
Eastcult and Greatjoy had merely mastered two of those pieces. Thanks
to their tremendous intelligence and wisdom, they had managed to find
a way to jam these two pieces together into a complete whole, albeit
with great difficult, and use the joined pieces to form their Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu had been able
to take control over three pieces, and had also had to work
incredibly hard to join them together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had mastered all
five pieces, allowing him a degree of understanding of every single
aspect of the Dao of the Sword. It was as though he had acquired all
five pieces of that shattered porcelain plate. He didn’t need to
waste time and effort finding out a way to make them fit together;
they fit together in a natural manner, because they represented the
five parts of the full Dao of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword… began
to change. It was no longer limited to any specific stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. He unleashed a
sword that was almost invisible to the naked eye, a traceless and
shadowless sword. And yet, when it appeared before the volcano titan
it suddenly transformed into a swirling black hole of sword-light
that dragged the volcano titan sideways. This had all happened too
suddenly, and the volcano titan couldn’t help but stumble
off-balance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like he was
toying with a child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Whoosh! Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strode amidst the
three volcano titans, his five mighty sword-intents having joined
together to form a cyclical sword-intent, a Samsara sword-intent. His
five mighty sword-intents were like five wooden spokes that now came
together to naturally form a perfect wheel! This naturally-forming
cycle allowed the different types of sword-intent to mutually
reinforce and strengthen each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning could
first initiate the Heavenbreaker sword-intent. Once he built up
enough power, he could suddenly transform it all into his Blood Drop
sword-intent, giving it an even more terrifying degree of penetrative
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop
sword-intent’s incredible speed, in turn, could be transferred into
the Heavenbreaker sword-intent, giving its ponderous strike a
terrifying level of speed that only made it even more powerful than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s five mighty
sword-intents flowed in a perfect cycle. As the saying goes, where
water flows a canal shall naturally form. Just like that, the five
mighty sword-intents easily came together to form a perfect cycle,
the Samsara sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Supreme Daos?
Just like that, he merged them together?” The azure-armored man
muttered to himself, “Don’t you dare fight with me over him.
Please oh please, don’t fight with me over him. He’s going to be
my master’s personal disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother,
Darknorth didn’t choose to leave when he reached the twenty-fourth
floor. Clearly, he gave up the right to become your master’s
disciple. As per the rules that were set down, you are responsible
for the first twenty-four floors while our big brother and I are
responsible for the final twelve floors,” the white-robed man said
immediately. “Our big brother is incredibly strict when it comes to
choosing a successor. So what if this kid has perfectly joined his
Supreme Daos together? There’s no way our big brother will be
interested in him. So, I think the best solution is to have him
become my master’s personal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless aeons ago,
those three grandmasters of the Dao of the Sword had perished. For
endless years, the three of them had abided by the orders of their
master and had waited here in the hopes of finding successors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… finding
suitable successors was simply far too difficult. Although Ji Ning
had displayed a certain degree of talent, none of the three had been
truly impressed by him. He hadn’t even been able to perfectly join
any of his Supreme Daos together! Give him the treasures left behind
by their Eternal Emperors masters? Preposterous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, Ning had
perfectly joined together FIVE different types of Supreme Daos! Looks
of blazing desire instantly filled the eyes of the white-robed man
and the azure-armored man. If looks could release energy, their gazes
were so heated that Ji Ning would’ve instantly melted into a
puddle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
muscular man let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, I’m
certain that there’s no way someone as strict as you would be
interested in him,” the white-robed man said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he has
five Supreme Daos? So what if he’s perfectly joined them together?
In the end, he’s still nothing more than a World-level cultivator.”
The muscular man continued coldly, “The more difficult a Dao one
choses, the more difficult the path a Samsara Daolord shall have.
With each step, a Samsara Daolord must straddle the line between life
and death. This is especially true with regards to the Daomerge.
Every era has given birth to monstrously powerful Daolords, but how
many of them have been able to gain eternity and become Hegemons?
Don’t be fooled by how talented this Darknorth kid seems to be; I’m
afraid that he has almost no chance of succeeding in his Daomerge in
the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
monstrously powerful Daolords; every single generation would give
birth to a few. But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Endless
Territories had only given birth to three Hegemons over the course of
its entire history. The muscular man’s words were spot-on; to
succeed in the Daomerge and gain true eternity was simply far too
difficult for these monstrously talented geniuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So… don’t be
overly infatuated with him,” the muscular man said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other words, big
brother, you aren’t interested in him, right?” The azure-armored
man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, then he’ll definitely become my master’s personal
disciple,” the white-robed man said hurriedly.

Chapter 35 – A Clash
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not finished
talking!” The muscular man was rather irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
and the white-robed man exchanged a glance, then the azure-armored
man said, “Big brother, what are you saying? I thought you didn’t
care about this Darknorth kid. Are you seriously going to fight with
us over him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, I’ve
memorized every single word you said just now,” the white-robed man
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been far too
long. They had been waiting here per the orders of their respective
masters for far, far too long. Ji Ning was the first one to truly
drive them wild with excitement. Although there had been one person
who had perfectly joined an offensive Supreme Dao with a defensive
one, that was just two Daos. Moreover, that man’s path wasn’t
really a good fit for the path their masters had chosen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s Dao of the
Sword, however, was a path which literally included everything. It
included techniques meant for slaughter, such as the techniques of
the azure-armored man’s master. It included ephemeral and
inscrutable techniques, such as those of the white-robed man’s
master. And it even included straightforward attacks of overwhelming
power, such as the ones used by the muscular man’s master, the
greatsword-wielding Hegemon. Ning’s Dao included everything and
joined it all together perfectly! He was able to study any of their
Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I said was,
don’t be overly infatuated with him.” The muscular man said
coldly, “In addition, I’m not the one who will decide whether or
not he’ll be allowed to become my master’s personal disciple. In
the end, it will be up to the greatsword as to whether or not it
accepts him as its master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
and the white-robed man were both stunned. The greatsword… it held
truly incalculable amounts of might within it. It was a Universe
treasure! Even Eternal Emperors dreamed of acquiring such treasures,
but alas, Universe treasures chose their wielders, not the other way
around. If the treasure refused to acknowledge you, there was no way
for you to bind it by force whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only decision I
can make is whether or not he qualifies to become my master’s
honorary disciple,” the muscular man said. “The decision of who
qualifies to become a personal disciple is up to the greatsword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? You are
planning to let him become an honorary disciple?” The azure-armored
man and the white-robed man both ground their teeth in frustration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, weren’t
you saying how unworthy he…” The azure-armored man couldn’t
help but start muttering under his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whether or not he
can become an honorary disciple will depend on if he can survive my
sword or not.” As soon as the muscular man spoke these words…
BOOM! He manifested a total of six arms, all six of which assumed a
tightened grip over that single deep blue greatsword! But of course,
this greatsword wasn’t actually a Universe treasure, just a Dao
weapon facsimile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man
transformed into a streak of sword-light that tore through the skies,
moving at an incredible pace of nearly five times the speed of light.
It must be understood that normally speaking, only Daolords of the
Fourth Step were able to attain such incredible speeds. But of
course, different people with different Daos would have different
areas of specialty. Ning’s Blood Drop sword-art also allowed him to
move at incredible speeds by using himself as a sword while using the
Blood Drop sword-intent. This was the so-called Blood Drop evasion
skill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop evasion
skill was Ning’s fastest evasion skill. The Shadowless evasion
skill was more unpredictable, but it was slightly slower. Ever since
Ning had perfectly joined together his five Supreme Daos, his Blood
Drop evasion skill had undergone a fundamental transformation, making
it even faster and more explosive. In the past, he was roughly able
to move at three times the speed of light. Now, he would be able to
force his speed to a new limit of four times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five
sword-intents of my Dao of the Sword have been joined together in a
perfect manner, but my evasion skill is still inferior to his?”
Ning had been utterly dominating those three volcano titans, but when
he saw the muscular man fly towards him from afar he no longer dared
to act complacently. He immediately used rope-type magic treasures to
separately tie up all three volcano titans, ensuring that they
wouldn’t be able to disturb him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Receive a blow from
my sword!” The muscular man’s voice thundered through the skies,
as did his distant sword-light. It transformed into a straight line
that chopped downwards towards Ning with furious power. The entire
world seemed to turn dark, leaving behind only that single terrifying
sword-strike as it chopped downwards. Ning was actually completely
unable to dodge this attack. His only choice was to defend against
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black hole of
sword-light spun out like a lotus flower in the darkness. It swiveled
outwards and unleashed layers of power. For an instant, its swiveling
movements became as explosively powerful as the Heavenbreaker stance;
in the next instant, it would become as soft and ephemeral as the
Shadowless stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! The deep blue greatsword chopped straight down upon the
black hole of sword-light, and the layers of swiveling ‘petals’
sought to transform into other sword-arts while furiously ablating
the power of the oncoming attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
defensive technique.” The muscular man could sense that the
offensive power of his deep blue greatsword was being slowly ablated,
ground away, and deflected. It was as though it had been trapped
within the cycle of Samsara, never to escape again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break!
Break!” The muscular man remained quite calm. He held absolute
faith in his master’s Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how tough you
are, I’ll break through with overwhelming power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a Dao of
overwhelming force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked flying
backwards. Even when he landed, he had to stumble five steps back
before recovering his footing. He stared rather cautiously at the
distant, muscular man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked it!
Ahaha! Just like that, he blocked our big brother’s attack in a
head-on collision. Absolutely incredible! That other poor bastard…
he might’ve had a perfect fusion of his two Supreme Daos, but our
big brother’s sword smashed him straight into the ground.” The
distant azure-armored man couldn’t help but sigh in amazement when
he saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
said, “Darknorth has mastered five Supreme Daos, and he’s joined
them together in a Samsara-like cycle. His sword-arts have absolutely
no flaws at all, and he’s reached an incredibly high level in all
five of his Supreme Daos. In terms of tenacity and toughness,
Darknorth’s Sword Dao is definitely the most tenacious and toughest
Sword Dao there is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are other
geniuses whose Sword Daos involve the perfect fusions of Supreme
Daos, but they all have flaws. Darknorth, however, is skilled in
every area. If he was to battle against one of them, he would be able
to attack their weaknesses.” The azure-armored man sighed in
approval. “Incredibly, absolutely incredible. He actually came up
with five Supreme Sword Daos! If in the future he can become a
Verge-level Daolord, he’ll definitely stand a good chance of
becoming the most powerful Daolord there is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was actually a
ranking of monstrously powerful Daolords. In the Endless Territories,
Palace Lord Dawnstar of the Twelve Palaces was one such Daolord. The
major powers of the Brightshore Kingdom all believed that if Bertulu
became a Verge-level Daolord, he would probably be comparable to Lord
Dawnstar in power. Lord Dawnstar had once slain an Eternal Emperor
with just three strikes of his saber… but despite that, he was only
ranked as the second most powerful Daolord of the Endless
Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the most
monstrously powerful Daolords had fused Supreme Daos together… but
despite that, there were still differences in power amongst them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
white-robed man let out an approving sigh. “Very true.
Unfortunately, we won’t live to see that day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
suddenly fell silent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, they
weren’t really living creatures. They also had to stay here
perpetually for the sake of choosing suitable disciples for their
masters. Although they were very willing to do this, they couldn’t
help but feel at least a little bit of yearning towards the vast
world outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man’s
six hands were clenched around the hilt of that single greatsword.
When he attacked, his savagery filled the skies. When he defended, he
was as unshakable as a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Facing him in battle
was like facing an enormous boulder that was crashing towards you. As
it rolled down towards you, it would only increase in power. If you
wanted to survive, you’d have to disrupt and shatter the terrifying
momentum of his attacks! Fortunately, Ning had many varied
techniques, and his ghostly, inscrutable Shadowless stance was able
to repeatedly tie down the muscular man’s movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” The
muscular man suddenly came to a halt. Startled, Ning did the same
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This lengthy battle had
been quite beneficial for him. The terrifying amount of pressure the
muscular man had placed upon Ning had helped him learn how to use his
sword-arts in a more effective and natural manner. The muscular man
eclipsed Ning in both speed and strength. Although Ning’s Dao of
the Sword had many different techniques hidden within it, he was only
just barely able to fight the man to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When my master was
at the World level, he was probably slightly weaker than you are
right now.” The muscular man looked at Ning, then nodded slightly.
“You are qualified to become my master’s honorary disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SHUT YOUR MOUTH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BIG BROTHER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two furious howls rent
the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The explosive howl of
‘shut your mouth’ had come from the azure-armored figure, while
the one who had called out ‘big brother’ had come from the
graceful, refined-looking white-robed man. The two immediately
transformed into streaks of light that flew towards Ning. They had
been keeping a close watch on this fight and had kept themselves
carefully attuned to every little ripple. As soon as they heard their
big brother speak to Ning, they became instantly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, you go
too far!” The white-robed man was a bit faster and as such was the
first to arrive. After descending, he said angrily, “Didn’t you
say you weren’t interested in Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” When
the azure-armored figure landed, he stared intently at Ning. “Don’t
go be someone else’s ‘honorary’ disciple. What’s the point of
being an ‘honorary’ disciple? The nine swords which my master
left behind are all incredibly powerful. When they join together,
they are all but invincible. Aside from the nine swords, I also have
many other treasures which my master left behind for his personal
disciple. As I see it, you are perfectly suited for becoming my
master’s personal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh yeah? In terms of
treasures, my master has even more treasures than yours!” The
white-robed man said, “Darknorth, why don’t you become my
master’s personal disciple instead? Our respective masters loved
each other as brothers. The reason my master was ranked as the second
brother was because he was second only to the Hegemon in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOU…!” The
azure-armored figure was infuriated. Who would’ve thought that at a
critical moment like this, when they were supposed to be working
together against their elder brother, the white-robed man would’ve
suddenly ‘backstabbed’ him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t blame me.
I’ve waited far, far too long to help my master find a suitable
disciple,” the white-robed man said in an innocent, ‘helpless’
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your faces!”
The muscular man had an icy look on his face as he finally snapped
out at them, unable to keep silent any longer. He then turned to look
at Ning. “It’ll be Darknorth’s decision as to who he chooses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To become the Hegemon’s
honorary disciple, or to become the personal disciple of one of the
other two Eternal Emperors of the Sword? Who should he choose?

Chapter 36 – The Hegemon’s Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning couldn’t help
but feel his chest tighten as the three stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When both the
white-robed man and the azure-armored man had attempted to stop him
from progressing any further, Ning had already decided that he would
need to be extremely careful in the thirty-sixth level of the Abyss
of Fiends. Even those more powerful than him had perished here, after
all. However, Ning was very confident in his defensive skills, and it
wasn’t like him to back down without a fight. He was willing to use
this main clone of his to take on the risk of challenging the final
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he won, he would
gain a tremendous fortune. And in the end… things had been much
simpler than he had anticipated. Not only had he mastered his
Heavenbreaker stance, he had almost automatically joined together the
five sword-intents into a Samsara sword-intent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it all made
perfect sense. Ning had reached the bottleneck in all five stances of
[Brightmoon] long ago. He had first broke through in the Yin-Yang
stance back in the Sword Palace of the Brightshore Kingdom, then had
broken through in the other four stances with increasing fluidity!
The more he trained, the faster the breakthroughs came until finally,
they all came together in a perfect whole – the Yin-Yang stance,
the Blood Drop stance, the Shadowless stance, the Soleheart stance,
and the Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
looked at the muscular man. “I wonder if this junior qualifies to
become the Hegemon’s personal disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was going to
choose, he would choose the best!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personal disciple?”
The muscular man was startled, then let out a rare chuckle. “Quite
ambitious, aren’t we? However, if you wish to become the Hegemon’s
personal disciple you have to be acknowledged by his Universe
treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has it refused to
acknowledge me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It hasn’t said
anything yet. Mm… how about this? I’ll help you ask.” The
muscular man suddenly shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back in the outside
world of the inner reaches. The 540,000 meter tall corpse of the
Hegemon had been silently standing there for countless years without
moving. His two hands remained perpetually clenched around the hilt
of that deep blue greatsword. Suddenly, a flicker of light appeared
on the surface of the greatsword as the sword let out a keening
sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A figure
suddenly appeared in front of the three corpses of the grandmasters
of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
I’m sure I wasn’t just imagining things. I’m sure I felt a
ripple just now.” A white-robed, silver-eyed man stared at the
three corpses with a solemn look on his face. “Did something
strange just happen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-sixth level
of the Abyss of Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three volcano
titans had been released by Ning long ago and had returned to their
respective positions, transforming into a trio of towering volcanos
once more. Ji Ning, the white-robed man, and the azure-armored man
stood there upon the devastated earth, staring at the muscular man.
All three of them were rather nervous. If the Universe treasure was
willing to accept Ning as its master, then there was no question what
Ning’s choice would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve asked it.”
The muscular man opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And? How’d it go?”
Ning asked. However, he had a bad feeling about what the answer would
be. If the Universe treasure had truly accepted him as its master,
there would probably be some certain, special signs that would
appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man
sighed. “Your understanding of the Dao of the Sword truly is
perfect, and it does indeed include the path of cultivation which the
Hegemon had walked! You have the most perfect Dao of the Sword that I
have ever encountered. But… that sword told me that it doesn’t
like you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t… like
me?” Ning was flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It just
doesn’t like you,” the muscular man said. “It followed our
master for countless years, and it likes people like Master himself;
as vast and bold as the seas, and as deep and steady as the
mountains. It doesn’t like your type.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So this was the reason
the sword had no interest in him. Much like how a man might fall for
a woman or vice versa, the Universe sword was only willing to
accompany someone who it took a fancy towards! Clearly, the Hegemon
had left a tremendous impact on it, making it strongly prefer
cultivators who had the same type of personality as the Hegemon had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that there
are no ties of destiny between myself and that sword.” Ning smiled
and shook his head. If it didn’t like him, there was nothing he
could do. Although he was rather disappointed, he wasn’t crushed by
the refusal! It was extremely difficult to convince a Universe
treasure to submit to you, after all. Even Eternal Emperors dreamed
of acquiring Universe treasures. Ning had mentally prepared himself
to be rejected by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… despite his
mental preparations, deep within his heart he couldn’t help but
feel a sense of strong disappointment. “You don’t like my type,
eh? Don’t like my type? I don’t like you either!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning himself
knew that these were nothing more than words of self-consolement.
This was the closest he had ever gotten to acquiring an Universe
treasure, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be too
disappointed, Darknorth,” the white-robed man consoled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Its just a Universe
treasure. Our big brother is very exacting, but that Universe
treasure is even more exacting. It also has a weird temper,” the
azure-armored man said hurriedly. “I really think you should be my
master’s personal disciple instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, have you
decided yet?” The muscular man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered for a
moment. It seemed as though he would have to choose between being the
Hegemon’s honorary disciple or a personal disciple of one of the
two retainer Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, can you
explain to me as to which treasures I’ll be able to acquire if I
become the Hegemon’s honorary disciple or a personal disciple of
your respective masters? What techniques I’ll gain? If you can tell
me a bit more, I’ll be better equipped to make the right decision,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Makes sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, let me
explain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three waved their
hands. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The formerly empty and devastated
ground before them became be filled with images of magic treasures,
all of which looked to be quite extraordinarily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go first.”
The azure-armored figure pointed at the levitating images of the nine
blood-colored swords. “First of all, you’ll gain these nine
precious swords. They are incomparably mighty, and it is almost
impossible to buy them under normal circumstances. You’ll also gain
this suit of armor, this gourd, and this banner. And of course,
you’ll also gain Master’s sword-arts legacy as well as his secret
arts, divine abilities, etc.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The majority of an
Eternal Emperor’s treasure trove lay before Ning. Ning couldn’t
help but be filled with many thoughts as he stared at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My turn.” The
white-robed man began to narrate the treasures he had to offer as he
pointed at the illusions of the violet-hilted, gold-hilted, and
white-hilted swords, as well as the many other treasures he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man stood
silently there in the rubble. Only after his second brother and third
brother finished speaking did he say calmly, “I have two sets of
treasures here for the two honorary disciples which Master is willing
to accept. You can choose one of your liking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first set
includes fifty million cubes of chaos nectar! It also includes two
Dao-seals which the Hegemon personally forged! It also has the sword
which the Hegemon used prior to him acquiring his Universe treasure.
This sword alone is worth just as much as the armaments which my
second brother and my third brother have offered you. In addition,
you’ll also gain access to the complete sword-arts legacy which
Master left behind, as well as his divine abilities and secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second set also
includes fifty million cubes of chaos nectar, two Dao-seals which the
Hegemon personally forged, and the suit of armor which the Hegemon
wore when he was alive. This suit of armor has many marvelous
properties, and it too is worth just as much as the armaments of his
two retainers. In addition, you’ll also gain access to the complete
sword-arts legacy which Master left behind, as well as his divine
abilities and secret arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
explanation, the muscular man fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man and
the azure-armored man both looked at Ning expectantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
carefully examined each of the levitating illusions. The white-robed
man and the azure-armored man had treated him very well, but this
involved a tremendous fortune for him. He absolutely could not treat
this decision lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two Eternal
Emperors had left virtually all of their treasures to their personal
disciples. The treasures were staggering in both number and value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of valuable
treasures, the two Eternal Emperors had more. But! What the Hegemon
had left behind would be more of use to him! It was highly likely
that no one in all the Endless Territories was a match for the
deceased Hegemon with regards to the Dao of the Sword. His sword-arts
legacy was something which Ning would never have a chance to learn
again. The Hegemon had successfully completed his Daomerge… his
sword-arts would definitely be of enormous assistance to Ning as a
valuable reference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The best treasures
are the ones which suit you the best. In addition… I’d have to
find a way to sell off the treasures of the other two Eternal
Emperors. The Dao-seals and chaos nectar which the Hegemon left
behind are of more immediate use to me.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive me,
seniors,” Ning said apologetically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man and
the azure-armored man both let out sighs, looking rather forlorn. The
white-robed man shook his head and smiled. “The two of us suspected
that this would be your answer. The complete sword-arts legacy of a
Hegemon… both of us know exactly how alluring such a thing is to a
cultivator of the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The complete sword-arts
legacy of a Hegemon of the Dao of the Sword was absolutely priceless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You might be able to
find a few grandmasters of the Dao of the Sword who were on the
general level of Emperor Mirrorsnow, but where would you even begin
to start a search for a Hegemon-level figure? Even after Ning became
a Verge-level Daolord, no sum of money would be enough for him to
locate such a complete sword-arts legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations, big
brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, you’ve
finally found an honorary disciple for your master.” The other two
both expressed congratulations. They couldn’t help but secretly
sigh to themselves. The two of them and their big brother had waited
for far too long for a successor. The only difference was that their
big brother was even more exacting than they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been countless
years, but their big brother had finally chosen an honorary disciple
for the Hegemon! The Hegemon would only accept a total of two
honorary disciples, which meant that his honorary disciples would be
treated many times better than the personal disciples of Emperor
Mirrorsnow were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword which the
Hegemon had once wielded, the suit of armor he had once worn… both
were truly priceless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
muscular man’s lips parted as he finally revealed a rare smile.
“Follow me.” He transformed into a streak of light and flew
towards the distant shrine.

Chapter 37 – The Paragon of Pills
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man and Ji
Ning advanced together into the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Inside the
shrine, Ning saw lakes of flowing lava, next to which were strange
trees that seemed to be made out of fine jade. Ning couldn’t
recognize where these trees came from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to the lava lakes
there was an ordinary-looking stone house, and there was a figure
seated in the lotus position within the house. The figure sat there
without moving, and from the looks of it had been there for countless
chaos cycles already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
muscular man walked over, then said respectfully, “I’ve chosen an
honorary disciple for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly realized
that the figure seated in the lotus position within the stone house
was most likely a fragment of the Hegemon’s will and memories which
the Hegemon had left behind prior to passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated figure
suddenly opened his eyes, and his eyes shone in the darkness of the
stone house like a pair of two vast transversal conduits. Ning was
instantly lost within his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My disciple… if in
the future you succeed in the Daomerge and gain eternity, it is my
wish that you repay the grace I shall show you today you unto the
Paragon of Pills.” A voice filled with complex emotions and
frustration rang out from within the stone room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light
instantly shot out of the seated figure and flew straight towards
Ning. As soon as it touched Ning, it was instantly drawn straight
into his body. As for the seated figure, it now seemed a bit dimmer
and paler. Moments later, the door to the stone house rumbled shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, a
series of images playing within his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These images were of a
muscular man who was training in sword-arts in his youth. It also
included images of him becoming an Elder God, then a World God, then
a Daolord, and finally an Eternal Emperor, as well as the many
sword-arts involved…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts started
off weak, became stronger, and then completely surpassed Ning’s
imagination. This Hegemon had reached his level after perfectly
joining together two Supreme Daos. Although this wasn’t quite as
impressive as what Ning had done, it wasn’t that far off either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He became a dazzling
figure that gained true eternity, and was then given the respectful
title of ‘Hegemon’! Not even the most monstrously powerful of
Daolords would dare to challenge an Eternal Emperor of such power.
This was because he himself was already one of the most monstrously
powerful of Daolords in his era. Now that he was an Eternal Emperor,
he only became even more powerful than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
sword.” Ning’s eyes were unfocused and intoxicated, and his
thoughts were completely filled with images of inconceivably powerful
sword-arts. Some possessed such incredible magic power that they
seemed to surpass the limitations of the Dao itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single strike of that
sword could pass through the boundaries of spacetime and slay a foe
who was a hundred territories away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single strike of that
sword could cause spacetime itself to flow backwards, allowing the
wielder to go back in time. Alas, it wasn’t able to allow
individuals who had perished in the past to be brought back to life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Prime Reaches of
the Genesis Lands of the Archaeus region of the alternate universe.
This was an incredibly mysterious place, and the thirty-five Eternal
Emperors who had perished here weren’t even the most important or
most mysterious aspects to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The living Eternal
Emperors didn’t care too much about the deceased ones. At most,
they’d display a bit of interest in the Universe treasures. What
the living Eternal Emperors truly cared about were certain mysteries
that were hidden within the prime essences of the universe! They were
what had allowed the master of the Church of Annihilation to rise to
power, becoming the number one expert of this entire universe and
unifying it under his banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black gauzy figure
flew through the skies, moving past the primessence chains that led
from the outer reaches, then flying directly into the world of the
inner reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that even
possible?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t the only way
into the inner reaches through traversing the primessence chains on
foot?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were eighteen
World-level cultivators and three Daolords standing at the outer
reaches end of the primessence chains. One of those World-level
cultivators was Waterlord Firesurge. Firesurge had also spent quite a
bit of time wandering the outer reaches, and had also benefited
greatly as a result of it. He felt that he had improved
significantly, and so he wanted to once more test himself against the
primessence chains. Alas, although this time he made it to the nine
hundred kilometer mark, he still ended up failing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can someone just
fly across?” Waterlord Firesurge stared in disbelief at the
gauze-clad figure that had just flown past them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the black, gauzy
figure flew past them, it was as though spacetime itself had no hold
over her whatsoever. She seemed to be drifting slowly, but in reality
she moved so quickly that she almost instantly disappeared from the
field of vision of the Daolords and the World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World-level
cultivators and Daolords must tread the primessence chains. If not,
they will be drawn into the abyss below and devoured. Only Eternal
Emperors would dare to ignore the primessence chains and fly straight
into the world of the inner reaches.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That had to
have been an Eternal Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was that Eternal
Emperor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords and
World-level cultivators quickly were able to guess at the status of
that person. Eternal Emperors were incredibly rare and few in number.
It must be understood that only two of them resided within the
Genesis Lands, with one being Emperor Maniseal and the other being
Emperor Northtree. That lithe figure that had flown past clearly
belonged to neither of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which Eternal
Emperor is it, then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve seen many
people and many things, but I truly have no idea who that was. Could
it be that a Daolord has recently completed his Daomerge and become a
new Eternal Emperor? But once that happens, the news would quickly
spread to the entirety of the Church of Annihilation.” The Daolords
and World-level cultivators continued to make their guesses, puzzled
at what had just happened, but they all memorized the appearance of
that black figure. They wanted to make sure that they remembered this
was a person for them to never, ever offend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The inner reaches. The
thirty-five ancient corpses still lay scattered around this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed,
silver-eyed man continued to stand there, silently inspecting the
corpses of the three grandmasters of the sword. “I’m sure I
sensed a special ripple just now… could it be that some of the
legendary secrets of the prime essences are hidden here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
carefully searched through every inch of the region. Anything
involving the secrets of the prime essences was enough to drive any
major power wild with lust. The Church of Annihilation was the
perfect example of what it could bring. Who wouldn’t go crazy for
something like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gentle wind blew, and
a figure appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
white-robed man was so badly shocked that even his face turned pale.
“How could someone have appeared right next to me without me
sensing anything at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, and an extremely famous one. He had once battled an
Eternal Emperor for an extremely long period of time before fleeing.
He was definitely strong enough to cause many other Daolords to sigh
in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He slowly turned his
head to stare at the nearby figure. Roughly thirty meters away stood
a slender figure who was dressed in black gauzy clothes. She emanated
an aura of endless coldness and purity, and she stood there as though
she herself was the genesis source of this world. Everything around
her seemed to naturally submit to her will! Here, she reigned
supreme.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primordial
Starqueen… the Paragon of Pills?” The white-robed man was so
horrified that his heart shuddered with fear. He hurriedly fell to
his knees with respect. “This junior greets you, Starqueen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The highest ranking
member in the Church of Annihilation was its leader and master, the
one who had unified this entire universe. Second to him were the
sixteen Starkings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen Starkings
were all unfathomably profound individuals, but the most powerful and
mysterious members amongst their ranks were the ones known as the
three Primordial Starkings! The reason why they were different from
the other thirteen and were titled as ‘primordial’ was because
they had been alive since the very birth of this universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White Emperor was
the teacher of the leader of the Church of Annihilation, and he was
one of the three Primordial Starkings. As for the Paragon of Pills,
she was also one of the three. She was an extremely mysterious figure
who moved in mysterious ways and rarely revealed herself. It was very
difficult for even Eternal Emperors to have a chance to meet with
her. However, most of the high-status members of this universe all
knew what she looked like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She always dressed in
black gauze and had a look of perpetual iciness about her. As for her
features, they were forever be masked by a formless barrier of fog.
There was no way to see her true features at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened
here…” The black-garbed figure stared at the distant corpse of
the greatsword-wielding man, complex emotions in her eyes. “Why did
I suddenly feel as though something momentous happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother… don’t
grow too impatient. Big brother, second brother, third brother…
I’ll reverse the flows of spacetime and bring all of you back to
life…” The black-garbed figure murmured softly to herself. She
had said these words far, far too many times. Her gaze was completely
focused upon the muscular, greatsword-wielding man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the look on
her face changed. The aura around her began to ripple and rumble as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that this place was the Prime Reaches of the Genesis Lands. This was
no ordinary place! Ji Ning and the various Daolords weren’t even
able to fly about here, a testament to how powerful the various
restrictive forces here were. And yet… just the slightest hint of
startlement from the black-garbed figure was enough to cause the aura
of the surrounding area to shake and rumble. All Daos were shaking,
as though wishing to retreat from her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where I stand, all
other Daos must bend the knee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man’s
heart shook with cold fear as he saw this. She lived up to her
reputation as one of the three Primordial Starkings! In fact,
according to the legends the only reason why the leader of the Church
of Annihilation was able to rise to power was because the three
Primordial Starkings had no interest in battle or power. The legends
said that in reality, the three Primordial Starkings were just as
powerful as their ‘leader’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, those were
just legends! The three Primordial Starkings, however, had indeed
existed since the birth of this universe. This was why everyone
believed that they knew the secrets held within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Everything was fine earlier. Nothing like this was happening.” The
white-robed man was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the black-garbed
figure, the Paragon of Pills, she stared at the treasures placed in
front of the muscular man. Others, such as Daolords, might not be
able to see anything, but her gaze easily pierced through the
restrictive spells and allowed her to realize that a treasure was now
missing from the pile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure has
disappeared? Who took it?” The Paragon turned to scan her
surroundings, causing everything within the inner reaches to fall
under her gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, what
happened here?” The Paragon of Pills stared intently at the
white-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…” The
white-robed man truly had no idea as to what he should say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome, white-robed
youth who had a longsword on his back suddenly appeared out of
nowhere.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had left the
Abyss of Fiends and returned to the inner reaches in a wonderful
mood. But then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
at the two figures in front of him. Although the white-robed,
silver-eyed man had an extraordinary demeanor, Ning wasn’t too
surprised by his presence; the inner reaches of the Genesis Lands
held quite a few Daolords of renown and power. But when he saw that
slender, black-garbed figure… Ning couldn’t help but feel a sense
of shock in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t too far
away from her, but Ning felt like a blind man groping for a flower
within the mists. He couldn’t see what she looked like; all he
could sense was an aura of incredible coldness radiating from her, so
cold that it burrowed deep into his soul and caused him to quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is this person?”
Ning was shocked. “Not even Lord Woodflower of our Sword Palace is
a match for her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-garbed figure
was staring at Ning as well, weighing him with a judging gaze. Her
eyes seemed to see right through him and all of his secrets! Ning
could sense that she was staring at him. It was a strange feeling;
she was staring at him, but he couldn’t see her at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it was you.”
The black-garbed figure suddenly spoke out, and her voice was just as
cold and crisp as he had imagined it to be. Suddenly, she waved her
sleeve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the rules
of the Church of Annihilation, all violence was forbidden within the
Genesis Lands. To forcibly abduct or teleport someone away was
similarly forbidden. The nearby Daolord just stared blankly, not
daring to make a sound. “Even if the leader of the Church of
Annihilation found out about this, he probably wouldn’t say
anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills,
one of the three Primordial Starkings… even if she chose to
massacre everyone in the Genesis Lands, what of it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making Ning
disappear, the Paragon of Pills said calmly, “You may leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
silver-eyed man immediately assented respectfully, then fled at high
speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
raised her head, staring at the corpse of the muscular,
greatsword-wielding man with an almost dazed look in her eyes. She
seemed to forget about time itself as she just stared at him
silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had died. Died a
long, long time ago. But his corpse looked just like it did when he
was alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Paragon of Pills.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The
black-garbed Paragon turned gracefully, sweeping the area behind her
with her dazzling, bewitchingly beautiful eyes. Off in the distance
stood a Daoist dressed in deep blue robes and a high crown. He was
walking straight towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maniseal.” The
Paragon’s voice remained as cool as ever. “I hear you are quite
talented. You’ve even managed to devise something known as a
‘Lifeblood Dao-seal’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Maniseal was
startled. Indeed, his greatest accomplishment in the Dao of Seals was
the Lifeblood Dao-seal, but very few people knew of this. In the
Church of Annihilation, the only Eternal Emperors who knew of this
should’ve been the church’s leader and the White Emperor. How was
it that another one of the three Primordial Starkings, the Paragon of
Pills, had found out as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you keep a
close watch on things, Paragon.” Emperor Maniseal nodded. “Then I
imagine you also know why I have come here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to reverse
the flows of spacetime to resurrect that disciple of yours?” The
Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of mastery
over reversing spacetime, you are probably more skilled than anyone
else in our universe,” Emperor Maniseal said. “The leader of the
Church and the White Emperor have made excessive demands of me. I
have no other options, which is why I have come to speak to you and
ask if you can consider reviving my disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I cannot save your
disciple, but the leader of the Church can,” the Paragon said
coolly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cannot save him?”
Emperor Maniseal was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To reverse the flows
of spacetime and to bring back to life a being whose truesoul was
extinguished… this is a violation of one of the grand Daos that
sustains the entire universe,” the Paragon said slowly. “The
universe continues to advance towards the future, and so to reverse
the flows of spacetime is to go against the will and destiny of the
universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lord of the
Church of Annihilation can borrow some of the power of the prime
essences of our universe and so would be able to resist the backlash
from the universe. I, however, cannot,” the Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of
disappointment appeared on Emperor Maniseal’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you say
long ago that it was much easier to reverse spacetime and bring back
to life those who were below the Eternal Emperor level?” Emperor
Maniseal felt both impatient and heartbroken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
gave him a cold glance. Emperor Maniseal’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, the
Paragon of Pills had already risen to stand at the very apex of this
universe. Back then, the leader of the Church of Annihilation had yet
to rise to power, and the mightiest figures in the universe were the
three Primordial Starkings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, the Paragon
of Pills had done everything she could, paid every price she could
pay, to try and reverse the flows of spacetime so as to bring back
her big brother. Alas… in the end, she had failed. She had suffered
such an incredible backlash from the universe that she herself had
nearly perished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gripped by despair, she
had said to the other two Primordial Starkings, “It would be much
simpler if I was trying to reverse the flows of spacetime for someone
below the Eternal Emperor level. But to revive someone who has gained
eternity… it is far, far too hard…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, the Paragon
of Pills had left by herself and disappeared for a long period of
time. Later on, when the lord of the Church of Annihilation had risen
to power and unified the universe, he had invited the sixteen
Starkings to join his organization. It was only then that the Paragon
of Pills had appeared once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not try to
reverse the flows of spacetime to revive your disciple. Aside from
the lord of the Church of Annihilation, no one can accomplish this
task.” The Paragon’s voice was chilly. “I… I cannot bring
anyone back at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Fubo knew that
he could no longer ask any more questions. This was the only female
member of the three Primordial Starkings, and she was unfathomably
strong. All three of the Primordial Starkings were on very good terms
with each other. When the Paragon of Pills had sought to revive her
brothers, the other two had sacrificed quite a bit in their attempts
to help her succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a matter of face,
reversing spacetime to revive someone was something of a taboo topic
for the Paragon of Pills. The only reason she had been willing to
tell Emperor Maniseal so much was because pitied him as someone who
shared the same desires as her, due to his wish to bring his disciple
back to life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, I sensed
that after you came here you abducted a young fellow,” Emperor
Maniseal said with a smile. “Is that young fellow your big
brother’s successor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maniseal.” The
Paragon gave Emperor Maniseal a hard glance. “I’m warning you
right now that you are not to get involved in the affairs of
juniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that, of
course! If there’s anything you need, Paragon, you can just let me
know. I’ll do everything I can to assist.” Emperor Maniseal
smiled as he produced a strange jade seal that was a mixture of balck
and white colors. “Consider this Dao-seal as my gift to that young
fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon glanced at
it, the corners of her lips curving upwards slightly. She waved her
hand, accepting the talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to send me
off.” The Paragon of Pills turned and gracefully departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Maniseal
watched as the Paragon disappeared off into the distance, then
revealed a hint of a smile. “The Hegemon of the Dao of the Sword…
it has been countless years since he passed away. This should be his
very first successor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Hegemon had
perished, he had set down certain restrictive spells around himself.
No one from the outside would be able to see any changes, but those
who were able to see through the restrictive spells would be able to
see just how many treasures lay hidden behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, the
Paragon of Pills had first risen to fame due to her mastery over
alchemy. This was why she was respectfully titled the Paragon of
Pills. In this universe, she was publicly acclaimed as the number one
alchemist, and no one had ever surpassed her in this regard. She was
naturally far superior to her big brother in terms of restrictive
spells, and so she was able to see through it with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Emperor
Maniseal, he was the undisputed number one master of the Dao of
Seals. As a result, in mastery over restrictive spells at least, he
was somewhat superior to the deceased Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were able
to see through the restrictive spells and note the number of
remaining treasures. However, neither of them dared to take the
treasures by force. If they did, they would suffer an attack from the
power of the entire Prime Reaches… and the Prime Reaches was where
the prime essences of the entire universe lay. This would represent a
strike from the entire universe, a strike of incalculable power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now within an
estate-world. This world was merely a few hundred kilometers in size,
and there was no way out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why was I captured
and brought to this place? That woman… did she act with malice in
mind, or was she motivated by good intentions?” This had been
completely unexpected. He hadn’t even had the chance to celebrate
the fact that he had become the Hegemon’s honorary disciple and
gained his treasures. Instead, he had almost instantly been abducted
by this new power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone actually dared
to attack him within the inner reaches? That had to mean she was at
least at the Eternal Emperor level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What will be, will
be. Not like there’s any way for me to avoid it.” Ning understood
that given how this major power had been able to abduct him without
him being able to put up any resistance at all… there was no way he
could fight back against her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense
himself being surrounded by an enormous surge of power. Moments
later, the world around him changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?” Ning
stared up ahead. He was in an area of endless darkness. The only
thing within this region was a strange, five-colored space bridge.
Aside from this five-colored space bridge, there was nothing but
darkness. As for Ning himself, he was standing atop the bridge. Next
to him was that slender, black-garbed figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve already left
the Archaeus region. Soon, we’ll reach the Trileaf Realm.” The
black-garbed figure spoke out, and the five-colored space bridge
beneath their feet was advancing through the darkness at incredible
speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were travelling
countless trillions of kilometers with every moment. They were moving
far faster than Prince Greatjoy’s teleporting abilities could
handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Left the Archaeus
region?” Ning was flabbergasted. Weren’t they in the Genesis
Lands just now? He spent nearly ten thousand freaking years
travelling through the Archaeus region and into the Genesis Lands.
How the hell did the suddenly leave it in an instant? He felt as
though it hadn’t even been enough time to boil a kettle of tea.
This level of speed was ridiculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, dare I ask…
what exactly is this Trileaf Realm?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My place.” The
Paragon of Pills gave a calm response.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 39 – A Half-Moon Loan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five-colored space
bridge continued to stretch off into the distance, easily traversing
the boundaries of both space and time. Just a short while later, a
world that looked like an Immortal’s abode appeared before them,
vast and beautiful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is the
Trileaf Realm. Long ago, I chose a location within the Sea of Bitter
Darkness and established a world within it. Ever since then, I have
been living here.” The Paragon of Pills said in a cold voice, “The
Trileaf Realm is a fairly well-hidden place. You probably have never
heard of it before today. In the future, you may visit whenever you
so desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning relaxed
slightly. It seemed as though this mysterious major power was
treating him quite well. “Senior, are you planning to let me leave
this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. Do you
think you’ll be able to succeed in your Daomerge and gain eternity
just by sitting here instead of going out adventuring?” The Paragon
glanced sideways at Ning. “Don’t worry. I’ve brought you here
for certain reasons. Once I’m finished, I’ll naturally let you go
on your way. In the future, you can enter and exit this place freely!
Although it’s quite difficult for outsiders to enter my Trileaf
Realm, things are different for you. You are the disciple of my old
friend, and you can thus be considered one of the juniors in my
lineage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning said, “Thank
you, senior.” Only then was Ning in the mood to spend some time
inspecting this Trileaf Realm. From the outside, it looked like an
enormous world that was being held up by a trio of blooming leaves.
This world was so vast that it was countless times greater than most
of the land masses Ning had encountered thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know why it
is named the Trileaf Realm?” The Paragon of Pills suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it because of
those three enormous leaves that are holding up the world? Is that
why it is named the Trileaf Realm?” Ning guessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon slowly
shook her head, but she didn’t explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon led Ning to
fly downwards into the beautiful fairyland world below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus region.
The Genesis Lands. The outer reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of fire
suddenly flew out of a secret region. Su Youji was dressed in her
usual fiery red robes, and her entire body was bathed in flames that
were shaped like a bird of some sort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t sense
Master’s aura any longer. Why can’t I sense his aura? I could
sense that he was in the inner reaches just a short while ago.” Su
Youji stared towards the inner reaches, a look of restless unease in
her eyes. In the moment that the Paragon pulled Ning away, Su Youji
had lost her ability to sense Ning’s location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had given her a
message-talisman, and she had given him one of hers. Theoretically
speaking, the two would be able to constantly sense where the other
was located and could meet up whenever they chose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have I suddenly
lost all contact with him? What should I do. What should I do?” Su
Youji felt extremely uneasy. This uneasy feeling had actually caused
her to give up adventuring through the secret region she had been in,
and give up on her chances to acquire the treasures within that
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji transformed
into a streak of light, repeatedly teleporting forwards as she moved
towards the inner reaches at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Firesurge!” A
group of cultivators was clustered together at the outer reaches end
of the primessence chains, and Waterlord Firesurge was with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Firesurge.” Su Youji immediately landed, then called out to him
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy?”
Seeing her, Firesurge immediately rose to his feet and asked
curiously, “Flamefairy, why have you come here? Judging from the
worried look on your face… what exactly has happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s my master.”
Su Youji said worriedly, “I can sense that Master vanished. I feel
very uneasy, which is why I immediately came over here. Have you seen
my master, fellow Daoist Firesurge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge shook his
head. “I haven’t seen Darknorth since he entered the inner
reaches. Did you just say that you lost contact with him, all of a
sudden?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Su Youji
nodded hurriedly. “But his message-talisman is still with me, and
it’s completely undamaged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had died, then
the message-talisman should’ve sensed it and then shattered apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the talisman
isn’t damaged, right?” Firesurge asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It did not.” Su
Youji nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world of the
inner reaches is filled with many different dangers,” Firesurge
said. “This is, after all, the place where this entire universe was
birthed. It is highly possible that Darknorth might have found
himself trapped in some location which prevents anyone outside of it
from contacting him. It is highly likely that your master is still
alive. But of course, for it to be able to sever all contact means it
is definitely an extraordinary location. It’s also possible that
your master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s heart
trembled. This was exactly what she was afraid of. Ji Ning had been
in the inner reaches for many years now, and she had been able to
sense his presence this entire time! The same was true for Heartlord
Solewind and his own retainer, Chaos Immortal Swallowback. Now, even
Prince Greatjoy had gone into the inner reaches, with his retainer
World Goddess Skywolf able to sense his presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now… all of a
sudden, she could no longer sense where Ji Ning was! Something
must’ve gone wrong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a bit longer.
From what I’ve heard, World-level cultivators generally won’t
spend too much time in the inner reaches,” Firesurge said. “Let’s
just wait a few thousand more years and see if he ends up coming
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded slowly. There was nothing else she could do. “Thank you,
fellow Daoist Firesurge.” Su Youji immediately chose a quiet corner
and then sat down in the lotus position. Her mind was now restless,
and she was in no mood to continue adventuring. Still… she had
already made shockingly great gains during her previous adventures in
the outer reaches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you have to
live.” Su Youji’s feelings towards Ning were very complex. Ning
was extremely powerful, and he had also saved her on numerous
occasions. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of love and
admiration for him, but she could also sense that he had someone else
in his heart. As a result, Su Youji had always been hesitant and
unable to voice her feelings for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the Sea of
Bitter Darkness, there lay the Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few ripples appeared
in front of an ancient, pitch-black building. From the ripples
emerged a pair of figures; the Paragon of Pills and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my estate.”
The Paragon of Pills spoke calmly as she advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning followed her
from behind. Rather curious, he asked, “Senior, why is it that I
don’t see any other cultivators within this estate?” There wasn’t
even so much as a gateguard. This truly was quite odd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I prefer the peace
and quiet. I dislike being disturbed by others,” the Paragon said
coolly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If any of the other
major powers of the Trileaf Realm saw how their exalted, transcendent
leader, the Paragon of Pills, was casually carrying on a conversation
with a mere World-level cultivator, they would almost certainly be
stupefied by this. The Paragon of Pills was famous for her cold
indifference! She generally wouldn’t even pay any attention to most
Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason she chatted
a bit with Emperor Maniseal was because he was very powerful as well
as a person who was struggling hard to revive his beloved disciple.
This was why the Paragon of Pills treated him differently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of them was an
enormous pill cauldron. Next to the pill cauldron there was a vast
lake that was a hundred kilometers in size, and above the lake there
was a waterfall that thundered downwards towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ning
stared at the lakes in utter astonishment. “Is th-th-th-that all
chaos nectar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred kilometer
lake that was completely composed of chaos nectar? Ning was rather
dazed. How much chaos nectar was that?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you understand
alchemy?” The Paragon of Pills looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you did, you
would understand. Chaos nectar is incredibly important to the
creation of pills, and it is chaos nectar which gives our pills their
various magical properties. Chaos nectar can give birth to life
itself; in fact, it can give birth to all things. It is an
indispensable part of alchemy,” the Paragon said. “An exceedingly
vast amount of chaos nectar is used up with the creation of every
highly valuable pill. That’s why I just went ahead and set up an
entire lake of it here. It makes it easier for me to withdraw as much
as I need when I engage in my alchemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Although the deceased Hegemon had prepared fifty million
cubes of chaos nectar for his honorary disciples, that sum couldn’t
even come close to the amount of chaos nectar in this hundred
kilometer lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
continued to walk forwards. They quickly arrived at a stone dais
before the enormous pill cauldron, whereupon she sat down in the
lotus position and turned her gaze towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
I would ask of you,” the Paragon of Pills said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pray tell, senior.”
Ning nodded respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you have
gained a legacy from the Hegemon. The Hegemon’s suit of armor
should be with you,” the Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a great sense
of shock. Even this was known to her?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning didn’t
try to play any games with her at all. He immediately nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That suit of armor…”
The Paragon hesitated for a moment, then continued, “Loan it to me
for a month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loan?” Ning was
secretly speechless. If she wanted to take it from him, there
would’ve been nothing he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and a
streak of light immediately flew out from his body and coalesced
within his hands into the form of an ancient, unadorned suit of
armor. This suit of armor had an aura that was as deep and profound
as that of a fathomless abyss. It was as though an enormous mountain
was lying within Ning’s palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Paragon of
Pills saw that ancient suit of armor appear within Ning’s palms,
she couldn’t help but tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
stretched his hand out, causing the ancient suit of armor to fly out
towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
slowly accepted the armor, placing it across her lap. She gently
stroked it with her hands, her fingers shaking uncontrollably. She
murmured something softly to herself, but Ning wasn’t able to hear
what she was saying at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you tell me if
the Hegemon told you anything when he transferred this legacy to you?
Did he mention anyone?” The Paragon of Pills asked softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon did not
say much to me. He only said a single thing.” Ning didn’t try to
hide it at all. “He said: ‘My disciple… if in the future you
succeed in the Daomerge and gain eternity, it is my wish that you
repay the grace I shall show you today you unto the Paragon of
Pills.’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still had no idea
that this black-garbed woman was the Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon’s heart
shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two crystalline tears
suddenly dripped down from her face. They landed on the suit of
armor, then broke apart into many tiny fragments. However, the mist
surrounding her made it impossible for Ning to see this at all.

Chapter 40 – [Seven Leafpill Chapters]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
was silent for a long moment. She then said, “I’m borrowing this
suit of armor for half a month, but I will compensate you for it. I
can agree to one request of yours, so long as it isn’t too
excessive. Think it over. Even if you ask for a golem as strong as a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, I can make it happen. Once you decide,
simply tell me what you desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt a surge of
joy in his heart. Loaning out the suit of armor brought with it such
a high ‘interest’? Senior, why don’t you borrow it for nine or
ten years instead? But of course, he didn’t say that aloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll only have a
single opportunity to make such a request of me. Choose wisely,”
the Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, lost in thought. What should he ask for? Treasures? But he
already had the Hegemon’s armor, fifty million cubes of chaos
nectar, and the Hegemon’s Dao-seals… asking for more treasure
really wouldn’t make that much of a difference to him. The only
thing which really mattered would be something which would have a
significant effect on his future growth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning’s
eyes suddenly lit up as he stared at the enormous nearby cauldron.
“Given the enormous cauldron and this enormous custom-made lake of
chaos nectar, I imagine you are highly skilled in the art of alchemy,
right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Paragon nodded. “In terms of alchemy… there is no one in this
entire universe who is a match for me. Even in the art of creating
golems, I would definitely rank in the top three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was badly startled
by this. What a tremendous claim to make! Only someone who felt
completely confident in their skills would dare to claim that no one
else in the entire universe would be a match for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, if you are
skilled in alchemy…” Ning nodded. “Can you transmit some
alchemy techniques to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alchemy techniques?”
The Paragon looked at Ning. “In the world of alchemy, such
techniques are generally considered secret and are never taught to
outsiders. You wish to study alchemy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head,
willing his Dao lightning and his Dao water to fly out from his body.
“Please take a look at them, seinor. This junior has learned a
certain secret art that can allow Dao lightning to join together in a
marvelous fashion, almost like the formation of a new pill. When
mastered, it will allow me to perfectly merge together nine types of
Dao lightning into my ‘Novessence Thunder’! It’ll be so
incredibly strong that I will be able to slay even Daolords of the
Fourth Step with it. However, actually training in this secret art is
incredibly difficult, and my understanding of the art of alchemy is
too lacking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To use divine
lightning as the ingredients for this secret art… the person who
created this secret art can be considered as having gained a basic
level of insight into the true art of alchemy.” The Paragon of
Pills nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
Daolord Allgod had only gained a ‘basic level of insight’ into
alchemy? And the scary thing was… compared to this woman, who
proclaimed herself to be the most talented alchemist in this entire
universe, Daolord Allgod probably truly had indeed only gained a
‘basic’ understanding of alchemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I almost never teach
my alchemy techniques to others.” The Paragon of Pills hesitated
momentarily. She once more gently brushed her fingers against the
armor in her lap, then said, “And to date, I’ve only taught it to
my three disciples. Today, you shall be the fourth to receive my
alchemy techniques. Remember – without my permission, you are not
to teach it to outsiders. Anyone who spends even a little bit of time
training in this technique will become an expert in alchemy, and will
be at least as skilled as the person who created this secret art of
yours. If you were to spend a bit of time and effort on my technique,
you would be able to easily surpass him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless
once again. Surpass Daolord Allgod in the Dao of Alchemy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Memorize this.”
The Paragon of Pills waved her hand. Instantly, a deep-green rune
that was shaped almost like a bamboo leaf flew out of her and towards
Ning. As soon as it touched Ning, it instantly began to burrow its
way into Ning’s memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later, the
process finally came to an end. Everything was memorized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new technique was now
present within Ning’s mind. Its name was the [Seven Leafpill
Chapters], and when Ning looked at it he felt as though he had been
enlightened with perfect wisdom. The purest truths and the greatest
of Daos could be described very simply. Just by reading through the
technique once, Ning’s insights into the Dao of Alchemy began to
skyrocket. Most likely, he was now already comparable to World God
Pillsaint in alchemy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason for this was
mainly because the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] were simply incredible.
But of course, it was also because Ning himself had reached a high
level of comprehension in his own Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Ning
stared at the Paragon of Pills, somewhat at a loss for words. “All
this junior wished for was a few pill-making techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just accept what you
have been given,” the Paragon instructed. “If you wish, you can
spend the free time you have training in alchemy. It might help
inspire you with regards to your swordplay as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Seven Leafpill
Chapters] constituted a very complete and perfect alchemy system. It
included detailed explanations regarding countless marvelous objects,
as well as many different ways by which one could concoct alchemical
medicines. Pills like the Pseudo Samsara Pill were actually
considered fairly common, low-level pills. The types of pill-making
techniques which Ning had wanted for his [Novessence Thunder]
technique merely constituted a small portion of what the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters] contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
continued, “Now that you have accepted my techniques… in the
future, if you meet people who are extremely skilled in alchemy, if
you so choose you may transmit the very first chapter of the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters] to them on my behalf! If they are able to
completely master the first chapter, you may then transmit the second
chapter. If this person is able to master all three of the first
chapters, send that person here to me. Remember – when you help me
choose future disciples, you are only permitted to teach them the
first three chapters. Although the first three chapters are profound
and abstruse, they aren’t as valuable as the other four. I have to
meet any potential disciple in person and be the one to decide
whether or not I will teach them those chapters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said respectfully. “This junior has already sworn a lifeblood oath
on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
slowly shook her head. Due to her connection to the deceased Hegemon,
she treated Ning very differently from the way she treated anyone
else. She didn’t want to force Ning to swear any lifeblood oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… although she
hadn’t requested it of him, Ning knew what was the proper way to
act. This was a truly shocking, earth-shaking technique. If he one
day was to encounter a powerful foe who was able to forcibly
soulscour him and steal this technique, then Ning truly would have
done wrong by her! But of course, Ning also believed that there
weren’t many who would be capable of soulscouring him, especially
since he would quickly break through to become a Daolord once he
returned to the Endless Territories. By then, he would become even
more powerful than he was now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take this Dao-seal.
This seal was gifted to you by Emperor Maniseal.” The Paragon of
Pills tossed a black-white seal made from jade over to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it,
rather startled. “Emperor Maniseal asked you to give it to me?
B-but… I don’t even know him…” Ning was so startled that he
forgot to respectfully address her as ‘senior’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He doesn’t know
you, but he does know me,” the Paragon of Pills said calmly. “This
Dao-seal is fairly valuable. It is of no use to me, but it will be of
great use to you. By giving you this Dao-seal, he has sown the seeds
of good karma with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt even more
puzzled. If he wanted to sow the seeds of good karma with you, why
would he give a Dao-seal to me? What exactly was the connection
between himself and this mysterious alchemist? Still… for even this
woman to refer to this Dao-seal as ‘fairly valuable’ meant that
it had to be truly extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you send your
senses into this Dao-seal, you will know how it is used,” the
Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. OH!. T-this…”
Ning was shocked by what he uncovered. What a terrifying Dao-seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao-seal was named
the ‘Lifeblood’ Dao-seal. All one had to do was store a drop of
blood within it, then hide it in a safe place. Once you perished, you
would instantly be reborn from the Dao-seal and the drop of blood
within it, no matter what how far away you had died! This… this was
equivalent to an extra life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning had
multiple clones of his true body, true, but once he became a Daolord
all of his true body’s clones would have to merge together. By
then, he would only have his true body and his Primaltwin. If his
true body died after that, it would truly be dead. There would be no
way to bring it back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao-seal
represented a second life for a Daolord. If you died, you would be
able to immediately come back to life. However, the inconceivable
power hidden within this Dao-seal would be completely consumed after
a single usage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dao-seal is
simply incredible. It can actually offer a Daolord a second life!”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t
realize was that this was merely one of the early prototypes which
Emperor Maniseal had created. Emperor Maniseal himself had Lifeblood
Dao-seals which could give even Eternal Emperors a second chance at
life! However, those Dao-seals were incredibly valuable; there was no
way Emperor Maniseal would simply hand them out as gifts! All he
wanted to do this time was to give Ning a gift and thus befriend the
Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, if he
needed to ask her for help, it would be a bit easier for him. It must
be understood that the Paragon of Pills truly had poured tremendous
amounts of effort into learning the intricacies of reversing
spacetime. In this respect, she truly was one of the most skilled
experts of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Suddenly,
a golden-robed figure flew over towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
golden-robed figure called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my
retainer.” The Paragon glanced at Ning, then instructed, “Yuhong,
lead Darknorth in finding a residence for himself. Also – you are
not to reveal to anyone the relationship between the two of us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
golden-robed elder said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
Paragon looked at Ning. “The Trileaf Realm has a total of five
Eternal Emperors within it, and all five of them are my retainers.
Spend some time exploring this realm. I trust it will be of some
benefit to you! When you wish to leave, simply let Yuhong know and he
will escort you away from here. As for the armor, I’ll return it to
you within half a month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said, but he couldn’t help but feel secretly stunned. Five Eternal
Emperor retainers? Even the almighty Hegemon of the Brightshore
Kingdom only had a few Eternal Emperors under his command, right? Was
this person before him someone who was on the same level of power as
the almighty Hegemon himself?

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” the Paragon
of Pills instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed elder
and Ji Ning both bowed respectfully, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Paragon, she
simply sat there in the lotus position, head lowered as she stared at
the ancient armor. She murmured softly to herself, “Big brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, the
Paragon of Pills had personally fashioned this suit of armor, then
given it to the person whom she loved the most, her ‘big brother’.
The Hegemon had worn it his entire life. Now, as she gently caressed
the armor, she felt as though she could sense his presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon shut her
eyes, then casually lay down on the ground and nestled her head
against the ancient armor. Just like that… she fell asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was the only person
in that entire ancient estate. It was deathly silent here. Without
her permission, not even her retainers would dare to enter this
place. Long, long ago, she had lived here alongside the Hegemon. Back
then, their second brother and third brother had often teased the two
of them for being such a pair of lovebird Dao-companions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now… she was the
only one left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After departing from
the Paragon’s estate, Ning was led away by Yuhong and the two
teleported to an estate that was at the top of a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my own
residence.” Daolord Yuhong smiled. “There are quite a few empty
manors around here. Choose whichever one you like, Darknorth. Those
three over there, the five over there, and also those two over there…
all of them are empty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the area
with his gaze, then pointed at a distant manor which was located
halfway up a mountain. “That one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll arrange for
some servants to go there. Just let me know if there’s anything you
need.” Daolord Yuhong smiled. “I’m quite familiar with the
Trileaf Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask…”
Ning suddenly asked something which had been puzzling him. “Who was
that lady who brought me here to this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t even
know what my master is named?” Daolord Yuhong was quite shocked.
His master was an incredibly exalted figure. For her to personally
bring a World-level cultivator like Darknorth to her residence meant
that she viewed him in a very special way. How was it that this kid
didn’t even know what her name was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea. I didn’t
dare ask,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you stay here in
the Trileaf Realm long enough, you’ll find out. It’s not really a
secret. Master was the one who created the entire Trileaf Realm,”
Daolord Yuhong said. “My master is one of the three Primordial
Starkings of the Church of Annihilation, the Paragon of Pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
bulged out. “P-P-Paragon of Pills?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the deceased
Hegemon had transmitted his legacy to Ning, he had said: “My
disciple… if in the future you succeed in the Daomerge and gain
eternity, it is my wish that you repay the grace I shall show you
today you unto the Paragon of Pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So the mysterious,
powerful woman was actually the Paragon of Pills!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder she
treated me in such a special manner,” Ning mused. “The dead
Hegemon and the Paragon of Pills clearly had a very special
relationship! Both he and the other thirty-five Eternal Emperors all
perished in the Prime Reaches of the Genesis Lands… I imagine the
Paragon of Pills knows all the secrets behind their deaths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is
extremely skilled in alchemy. In the Dao of Alchemy, she is the
undisputed number one expert of our entire universe. The
second-ranked figure has perhaps a tenth of Master’s skills in
alchemy. The ten most dazzlingly famous pills and medicines in this
entire universe were all forged by Master,” Daolord Yuhong said
smugly. “You can imagine for yourself how incredibly talented my
master is in the Dao of Alchemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And that’s not her
only skill. Although she hasn’t spent as much effort in artificing
and golem-making, she still ranks as one of the top three experts in
this universe.” Daolord Yuhong suddenly added smugly, “Her
retainer, ‘Emperor Gonflame,’ once studied the art of artificing
under her. He has now surpassed her in this regard, and is considered
the number one expert in artificing within our universe. When Master
told you to go explore the Trileaf Realm, I’m sure that her true
goal was for you to go pay a visit to Emperor Gonflame. Cultivators
need to be able to acquire suitable weapons, after all. The weapons
of others will never be a perfect fit for you; only a custom-forged
weapon that was made for you personally will be an ideal fit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Clearly, the Trileaf Realm had a truly transcendent
status within this universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
was this universe’s foremost expert in alchemy. Her retainer,
Emperor Gonflame, was its foremost expert in artificing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, although
it had a transcendent status, what really mattered in the world of
major powers was power itself! The lord of the Church of Annihilation
had been able to unify his universe thanks to his overwhelmingly
great power. Emperor Gonflame might be the number one artificer and
weaponsmith, but he was still just a retainer. The reason why he and
the other four Eternal Emperors were all willing to be retainers to
the Paragon was because of her incredible strength! Similarly, the
reason why Emperor Maniseal had gifted Ning a Dao-seal via the
Paragon in order to befriend her was because of how strong she was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where does Emperor
Gonflame live?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look over
there.” Daolord Yuhong pointed towards a distant inferno that
towered through the heavens. The skies themselves were bathed a fiery
red color. “That right there is Emperor Gonflame’s residence. Go
pay a visit when you have some free time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Then
I’ll go back to my own residence for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come find me if
there’s anything you need.” Daolord Yuhong smiled warmly. He
certainly wouldn’t dare to treat Ning in a negligent manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
transformed into a streak of light as he flew towards his own estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate already had
a number of servants within it. When they saw Ning descend from the
skies, they all bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled
at them. “Carry on with your normal tasks. Do not disturb me unless
I call for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,” they
all acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
entered the estate. As he had descended, he had instantly sent out a
stream of Immortal energy and bound the estate to him. Cultivators
would only feel at ease if they were in complete control of the
estate they were residing in! But of course, when Ning left he would
naturally disperse the binding seal he had laid upon the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strode forwards
through his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… a stone door
within the estate swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the room.
Past the stone door was a circular stone disc that was covered with
many divine runes. Ning immediately walked forwards, then sat down in
the lotus position atop the stone disc. He could sense ripples of
power emanate out from the disc to cover him and his heart, causing
him to completely calm down. Moments later, the giant stone door
swung shut once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the estate’s
meditation room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take another
look.” Ning closed his eyes as he once more began to mentally read
through the contents of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters]. He spent five
full days in the careful reading process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Seven Leafpill
Chapters] provided a slow, systemized guide to the art of alchemy.
However, Ning didn’t need to actually concoct pills, as he mainly
needed to learn certain alchemical methods to help him work on his
[Novessence Thunder]. Althrough the alchemical techniques in the
first three chapters were fairly formidable, they were nothing
compared to what the final four chapters held! This was especially
true for the alchemical techniques held within the seventh chapter.
Those were truly incredible, and were most likely the techniques
which the Paragon of Pills herself used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning had been
able to develop five Supreme Daos and then join them together, he was
able to learn technical skills like these quite quickly. Still, he
was far from being at the level which the Paragon was at. He had to
spend another five full days before he was able to just barely learn
and understand the alchemy techniques contained within the seventh
chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’ve only
learned half of it, if I used it to actually concoct pills I would be
far more effective than if I used all the techniques of the first
three chapters.” Ning was in an excellent mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to test out the
[Novessence Thunder] and the [Novessence Water], I suppose.” Ning
could sense that he now had much more control over his lightning and
water. The alchemical techniques which the Paragon of Pills had given
him had improved his finesse more a thousand times over. No wonder
the Paragon had said that if he spent some time and effort on it, it
would be easy for him to surpass the creator of the [Novessence
Thunder] in alchemical skill. This alchemical system, the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters], truly was the most supremely sacred sutra of the
Dao of Alchemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes and
began to visualize his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his Jindan chaos
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering Dao-tree
that was 108,000 meters high was here. This tree symbolized Ning’s
insights into the Dao of the Sword. In truth, he could break through
to the Daolord level whenever he wanted, allowing his Dao-tree to
surpass that limit! Ning had actually already reached the World level
in many different Daos, such as wind, fire, lightning, and space, but
he hadn’t been able to cause new Dao-trees to form for them within
his Jindan chaos region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The region was filled
with flickering lightning essences and gushing water essences that
bubbled with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” The
azureflower mist energy spread out, easily taking control over two
streaks of Dao lightning. These were the two easiest types of Dao
lightning to control; Watersmoke Lightning and Firecloud Lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Seven Leafpill
Chapters]…” Ning immediately began to use the Leafpill
techniques. Slender threads of slender golden light began to appear,
each thread filled with countless divine runes. The threads slowly
manifested into a pair of enormous golden hands that gently grasped
the two types of Dao lightning, then began to almost pinch them
together with ease, continuously harmonizing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the two streaks
of Dao lightning began to transform. The fire and the water merged
together, producing a single stream of deep azure lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had succeeded in
merging two types of Dao lightning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too easy.” Ning
himself was shocked at how easy it had felt. It had been as easy as
breathing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go straight
to three types.” Ning was brimming with confidence. Logically
speaking, he should’ve first left behind a ‘seed’ for the
dual-essence thunder, but he was so confident that he couldn’t even
be bothered to do so. He went straight to a tri-essence thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the giant golden
hands was gripping the bi-essence thunder, while the other golden
hand picked up a strand of Earthfiend Lightning. The two quickly
began to merge together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Completing the
tri-essence thunder was more than ten times as difficult as
completing the bi-essence thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… step by step,
Ning managed to use the [Novessence Thunder] technique to finalize
his tri-essence thunder! The tri-essence thunder was a streak of deep
yellow lightning. When the lightning spread out, it contained so much
power that it was clearly significantly stronger than the seven types
of Dao lightning and Dao water added together.

Chapter 42 – Quadressence Water
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full day passed in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, Ji Ning
resided within a side pavilion within the estate. He just sat there,
staring past the railing towards the beautiful scene of the Trileaf
Realm outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning stretched
out a finger, causing a strand of deep yellow lightning to jump out
from his fingertip. It looked absolutely beautiful, but it contained
terrifying amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then stretched out
a second finger. From this finger, a thin stream of water came
pouring out, swirling around his fingertip. The water emanated a
beautiful, gemlike aura of green light, but its power was on a
slightly lower level than that of the lightning. And yet, a powerful
Daolord of the First Step who was touched by this stream of water
would be instantly frozen into an ice statue. Even his truesoul would
be frozen solid, then crumble into tiny bits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the
quadressence Dao water Ning had been able to create.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lightning is brutal
and wild. To tame and control lightning is more difficult than taming
and controlling water.” Ning nodded slowly. “For now, creating
tri-essence thunder is my limit. To master quadressence thunder is
far too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the lightning and
the water could go up to the ‘novessence’ level. However, the
difficulty level would skyrocket with each additional essence.
According to what Daolord Allgod had said, a Daolord of the First
Step would be able to just barely master the tri-essence thunder. A
Daolord of the Second Step had a chance to master the pentessence
thunder, a Daolord of the Third Step might be able to master the
heptessence thunder, while a Daolord of the Fourth Step would be able
to master the complete Novessence Thunder! Ning was still merely at
the World level. It was all thanks to the azureflower mist energy and
the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] that he was able to master the
tri-essence thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, my most
powerful killing attack is once more the ‘Yin-Yang Sword Domain’.”
Ning couldn’t help but let out a laugh. This was clearly a
defensive technique, but because of his upgrade powerful
multi-essence Dao water and Dao lightning it was now his most
powerful killing technique as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.” Ning
waved his hand, causing a figure to appear out of nowhere. It was
World God Pillsaint, and he had a rather blank look on his face. He
was dressed in loose red robes. A smear of grease could be seen on
his red lips and his white teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Master.” World
God Pillsaint started to laugh when he saw Ning. “I was wondering
what was going on. I was in the middle of a meal when the world
around me suddenly changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You might’ve been
having fun stuffing your face with food, but I’ve been freaking out
for quite some time now.” Ning laughed. When he had been abducted
by the Paragon of Pills, he truly had felt quite nervous. Thankfully,
it had been a good thing in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
World God Pillsaint was rather puzzled as he scanned his
surroundings. “And where are we? And right, where is Youji? Didn’t
you have a number of comrades travelling with you, Master? Why are
you sitting here by yourself? Heeeey… and it seems as though you
have some servants here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Good lord, you talk a lot. Just shut your mouth for a moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Pillsaint
immediately fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I asked you to come
out because I wanted to bestow some good fortune upon you,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good fortune?”
World God Pillsaint was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Don’t fight
back.” As Ning spoke, he reached out with a finger and tapped
Pillsaint on his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning directly
transmitted the first chapter of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters]
directly into Pillsaint’s mind. According to what the Paragon of
Pills had said, Ning was at most permitted to transmit the first
three chapters to certain people of his choosing! If Pillsaint was
able to learn the first three chapters in a fairly short period of
time, Ning would be permitted to bring Pillsaint before the Paragon,
at which point he might earn a truly great opportunity for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to do this
right away. Once they went back to their own universe, it would most
likely be close to impossible for them to return to this universe
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow. T-t-this is…
this is absolutely inconceivable. Inconceivable! This is TRUE
alchemy! Absolutely incredible! Compared to this, the crap I learned
in the past can’t even be called alchemy!” World God Pillsaint
began to scream with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but start to laugh upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is simply
marvelous! You can actually use alchemy like this?! A completely new
world, a completely new Dao of Alchemy, has opened up before my
eyes!” Pillsaint only grew increasingly excited as he spoke. He
stared at Ning, his eyes blazing with excitement. “But Master… it
seems as though you only transmitted part of a complete technique to
me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, this is just
the first chapter,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the rest?”
Pillsaint was extremely excited. Alchemy and pill-making was his area
of specialty. He was already delirious with joy upon having received
the first chapter of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters], a supreme, sacred
manual for the Dao of Alchemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you fully
master the first chapter, I’ll naturally transmit the second
chapter to you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second chapter? Does
that mean there’s also a third chapter? And a fourth chapter?”
Pillsaint was so excited that his face had turned beet-red. “Who
created this alchemy technique? My master was a Daolord who was
extremely skilled in alchemy and quite famous, but compared to what
you just transmitted to me… he is way, way, waaaay inferior! I
insist on becoming apprenticed to the person who created this
technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“You might want to become that person’s apprentice, but that
person might not want to accept you. Calm down and focus on learning
the technique I just transmitted to you, and you might have a chance
in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right!”
Pillsaint nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Pillsaint
suddenly fell to his knees, intending to kowtow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. He
hurriedly lifted Pillsaint back up to his feet. “Pillsaint, what
are you doing?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you might
not understand what this alchemy technique represents. To me… this
is a new path, a new Dao that leads to the greatest heights of my
profession. This… this is the true Dao of Alchemy. I’ll be able
use it to become a Daolord… and perhaps rise to even greater
heights.” Pillsaint said gratefully, “I, Pillsaint, have no way
of repaying you for your gift of the Dao…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “All you
have to do is study hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao of Alchemy led
all the way to the Eternal Emperor level! By using this Dao,
Pillsaint might very well become an Eternal Emperor himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he saw a
chance to become a Daolord, Pillsaint began to spend all of his time
in frenzied study and training. Ning had merely memorized some of the
pill-making techniques, but Pillsaint was thoroughly analyzing and
studying every aspect of the technique. He even went as far as to try
them out in actual pill-making. Pillsaint truly was quite talented in
alchemy, but he never had a teacher as good as this. Although his
previous master was quite talented, he was still significantly
inferior to even the likes of Daolord Allgod, to say nothing of the
Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that this
opportunity had come before him, Pillsaint truly had a chance to soar
into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that his foundation was still the Dao of the Sword! He was mainly
going to make use of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] to learn more
about alchemy. Pillsaint was his retainer; it would be of tremendous
help to Ning if Pillsaint was to become an incredible grandmaster
alchemist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day after
transmitting the first chapter to Pillsaint, Ning departed from his
estate and transformed into a streak of light which flew off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Darknorth. Greetings, fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, fellow
Daoist Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning encountered quite
a few World-level cultivators on his journey. On occasion, he even
met a few Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Trileaf Realm was
an incredibly vast world, much like how the Brightshore Kingdom
itself also contained countless living beings and cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Gonflame?”
Ning spent more than six hours flying and teleporting at top speed
before finally reaching Emperor Gonflame’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
Emperor’s residence. Outsiders are not permitted to enter.” Two
novices were guarding the gates to the estate. They immediately
barked at Ning upon seeing him fly over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior has
heard of the Emperor’s skill in artificing and thus has come to
greet him. I wonder if I might be fortunate enough as to have an
audience with him?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you’ve come to
purchase treasures?” One of the novices pointed off into the
distance. “Enter from the side entrance. Someone will help take
care of you. Don’t you even know which door you are supposed to
enter through? This here is the main entrance. Generally speaking,
major powers who have come to meet with our Emperor will wait here as
we send the message to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pardon me for my
rudeness.” Ning didn’t really mind. He immediately flew towards
the side entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the two novices,
they continued to stand there in front of the estate in a smug
manner. Their master was the number one artificer in their entire
universe. Quite a few people came to ask to meet him. Even Eternal
Emperors came to request a meeting, to say nothing of Daolords. All
of them had to first go through the novices. This naturally made them
arrogant and dismissive towards a mere World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gah? Are there so
many treasures here that they stack them up in front of the
entrance?” As Ning flew towards the side entrance, he couldn’t
help but feel shocked upon moving closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was just
the side entrance, it was still dozens of meters wide. There were
quite a few servants there, as well as three treasures which hovered
above the entrance. One was a pearl that glimmered with fiery light
and which emanated faint ripples of might. The second was a white
flower that emanated waves of white light, bringing a sense of peace
and harmony to those who were bathed in it. The final treasure was a
painting depicted a world of mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, have
you come to purchase treasures?” In front of the door stood a
female servant with unbound hair who emanated the aura of a Daolord.
Most likely, she was a Daolord of the First Step, and she smiled at
Ning as she spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please enter, fellow
Daoist. Any of the treasures you see inside are for sale.” Although
Ning was at the World level, the female servant didn’t show
discourtesy as a result of it. The treasures they had here were all
for sale, and they were all items which Emperor Gonflame made in a
casual manner when testing out certain ideas. Despite that, they were
still items which would drive Daolords in the outside world utterly
mad with desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped into the
residence, and things immediately changed. As soon as he passed
through the doorway, it was as though he entered a vast expanse in
outer space, filled with countless twinkling stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were cultivators
walking through this region of void-like space, as well as servants
and attendants who were waiting on them. They strolled through the
void, gesturing at the various stars. Every single ‘star’ was
actually a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure costs
three million? That’s a bit too expensive, right? Can you lower the
price a bit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll buy this
one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords here all
acted in a very humble manner. Emperor Gonflame’s store didn’t
hold any treasures which were less than a million cubes of chaos
nectar, but what it did have drove countless cultivators mad with
desire. As for the World-level cultivators… almost all of them only
came for window shopping. They’d browse through the items but not
buy them. They were really here just to expand their horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning entered this
region of void-like space, the attendants all glanced at him.
Although they all had courteous looks on their faces, in their hearts
they muttered to themselves, “Ugh, another World-level cultivator,
here to look but not to buy.”
</P>

Chapter 43 – Ji Ning’s Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
attendants in the store, and the majority of them were busy
accompanying the Daolords. As a result, Ji Ning was by himself after
entering the place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damned impressive.”
Ning stared at the many treasures in the void, all of which gleamed
like shining stars. The very first treasure he took a close look at
gave him a bad shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single treasure
was protected by restrictive spells, which was why they glittered
like stars from afar. By sending your senses out, you would be able
to gain some detailed information regarding each treasure. As for
this first one, it was a shuttle-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodfire Azuresun
Shuttle. It takes three thousand years and ten thousand cubes of
chaos nectar for it to be charged up. After it is charged up, it can
be used a single time and unleash the power of a Daolord of the
Fourth Step. The cost is eight million cubes of chaos nectar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It can only be used
once each time?” Ning was secretly speechless. “It seems you
really can’t predict the power of a Daolord just by looking at him.
He might look weak, but have a ridiculous treasure like this. Thank
goodness that treasures like this are ridiculously expensive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning went through
one magic treasure after another. Ordinary Eternal weapons filled
with sword-intent and saber-intent were fairly cheap; few of them
could breach the million cube price range. The ones which Emperor
Gonflame had put out for display all had certain special properties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the magic treasures
here were special in some way, which was why they exceeded a million
cubes in price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Hearteater Clock.
It contains a secret art of a Heartforce Cultivator Daolord of the
Fourth Step. When activated, it can attack the enemy’s mind and
cause weaker enemy’s to completely lose control. The price is fifty
million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is insane.”
Ning was truly frightened by this treasure. He knew very well that in
a life-and-death battle, to lose focus for even an instant could
result in you dying and your Dao vanishing! This item was clearly
described as having a secret art of a Daolord of the Fourth Step who
was a Heartforce Cultivator. The power of the attack had to be
extraordinary! For a non-Heartforce Cultivator to be able to suddenly
unleash a heartforce attack of such power… this treasure was truly
insane in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the price was
insane as well. Fifty million cubes? Very few Verge-level Daolords
would be willing or able to buy such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were evasive-type
magic treasures that would allow you to instantly flee at a hundred
times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were
formation-type treasures which, when used, would trap the opponent so
thoroughly that it would be almost impossible for him to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was even a
sword-formation formed from a total of 216 high-grade Eternal swords
of extraordinary power. It was perfect for a Ki Refining Daolord of
the Fourth Step, and the more powerful the Daolord was the more power
the sword-formation could unleash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also a
particularly priceless sin-treasure which contained a total of 999
sinfiends. Every single sinfiend was comparable to a Daolord of the
Third Step in might, and once this treasure was unleashed it could
decimate ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step. However, this treasure
truly was ‘priceless’, in that you could only barter for it with
Emperor Gonflame by using incredibly valuable treasures of your own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning saw this
treasure, he mumbled to himself, “Once I merge my nine types of Dao
lightning into my Novessence Thunder, I’ll be able to wipe out
Daolords of the Fourth Step as well. Even if thousands of sinfiends
attack me, my lightning will be able to wipe them all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
viewings, he felt rather speechless. Still, the majority of these
treasures weren’t really useful to him, because he already had
those five powerful golems! In addition, he would quickly become a
Daolord upon returning to the Endless Territories. When that
happened, his [Novessence Thunder] and his [Novessence Water] would
rapidly grow in power. There really weren’t that many treasures
which would attract Ji Ning’s interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ones that did were
way too expensive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cheapest of evasive
treasures, for example, started at ten million cubes… and those
only moved nine times faster than the speed of light. As for the ones
which allowed you to flee at a hundred times the speed of light, they
were similarly priceless and could only be procured through trading
treasures of your own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at a
distant treasure, his gaze rather distant. He murmured to himself,
“This is what I really need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was exactly what he
needed, and it was also something he could afford.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance, a
snow-white sword that emanated an aura of endless coldness could be
seen hovering in the air. He sent out a slight strand of mental power
and was able to immediately know what this sword did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lifeblood weapon.
The cultivator can pour all of his insights regarding his Sword Dao
into this weapon to charge it with a Sword Dao quintessence. When you
use a weapon which is perfectly aligned with your own Sword Dao, it
will be able to unleash the most amount of power! You can use it to
continuously perfect and upgrade your Sword Dao! In addition,
lifeblood weapons are all created from incredibly precious materials
and can grow alongside you. If your Sword Dao is strong enough and
you feed it enough precious materials, then with a bit of luck you
might very well give birth to a Universe weapon in the future. The
price is thirty million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is a
lifeblood weapon,” Ning murmured to himself. He had heard of them
long ago, but not even the Sword Palace’s Armaments Valley held
any. lifeblood weapons were simply too rare; whenever a grandmaster
artificer managed to finally produce one after an enormous amount of
effort, other cultivators would immediately charge forwards to
purchase it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lifeblood weapons were
given that name because they truly became one with the cultivators
who wielded them, and the quintessence within them would be created
and formed by their wielders. But more importantly than that, they
could also grow and become increasingly powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the perfect
weapons for cultivators, the weapons which could truly unleash a
cultivator’s maximum potential! If Ning used an ‘ordinary’
weapon, he would probably only be able to unleash 30% to 40% of the
amount of power he could unleash if he was using his own lifeblood
weapon! This was what made lifeblood weapons so powerful… and they
could grow without any limitations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
top-grade Eternal swords were the best weapons you could buy. But
lifeblood weapons could continuously grow alongside you, growing more
powerful as you yourself did. In the hands of others, it would
perhaps merely be an ordinary top-grade Eternal weapon, but in the
hands its true master, it would be countless times more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all Eternal
Emperors used lifeblood weapons… and if evolved and empowered to a
sufficient degree, lifeblood weapons had a chance of transforming
into Universe weapons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Palace of the
Sword is filled with sword cultivators, and whenever any of them
discover a lifeblood weapon they will go crazy for it.” Ning’s
gaze was blazing with eagerness. “Who would’ve thought I’d run
into one such weapon here in this alternate universe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lifeblood weapons could
only truly fuse with their very first master. Once that first master
perished, they would become nothing more than ordinary weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is what I
really need. My Sword Dao encompasses all aspects of all sword-arts.
It is extremely difficult for me to find a sword which suits my Dao,”
Ning mused. “I need a lifeblood sword that will become as powerful
as I myself will!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.”
Ning glanced at a nearby attendant and sent him a mental message. The
Daolord attendant glanced back at him, puzzled. What did this
World-level cultivator want?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need this
lifeblood weapon,” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lifeblood weapon?!”
The distant attendant was badly shocked by this request. He hurriedly
walked over, stepping through the void of space as he quickly arrived
next to Ning. “Fellow Daoist.” The attendant hurriedly smiled at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you lower the
price of this lifeblood weapon a bit?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are friends
with the Emperor or perhaps know his senior disciples, they might cut
you a deal. I’m just a lowly attendant; I don’t have that
authority,” the attendant said. “This sword is a lifeblood weapon
that was forged just a short while ago. If you wait just a bit
longer, I imagine other sword cultivators would appear and
immediately snatch it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Sword
cultivators were devoted to the sword. All you needed was one sword
to be completely devoted to, then use it to destroy all other arts.
Foes might use all sorts of strange techniques and spells, but when
my sword emerges it shall shatter the heavens and crush the earth,
wiping out all in its path! Ning’s own Sword Dao was already quite
terrifying. When matched with a suitable lifeblood weapon… that
would be adding strength atop of strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any sword cultivator
would be willing to sacrifice all of his other treasures for the
chance to acquire a lifeblood sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty million
cubes…” Ning stared at that snow-white sword, emanating that aura
of freezing cold. This truly was a painful price, as the deceased
Hegemon had only given him fifty million cubes. His darkspace
flamestone hoard was only worth ten million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll buy it.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please wait a
moment. I’ll go make a report,” the attendant said. “I don’t
have the power to release the restrictive spells binding this
lifeblood sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded in understanding. One couldn’t be too careful with lifeblood
swords. If someone was able to so much as touch them, the sword would
be ruined for anyone else and become nothing more than an ordinary
weapon. The first binding performed on a lifeblood weapon was
critical, as only the first binding could be a true, complete one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant left to
make his report. As for Ning, he just stared at the sword, murmuring
to himself, “It’d be wonderful if I could acquire six lifeblood
swords. I’d be even stronger.” But of course, if anyone heard
Ning’s secret wish, they would probably laugh themselves to death.
A single lifeblood sword was already a treasure of incalculable
value. SIX of them? Who would even dare think of such a thing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, the attendant reappeared. Only, he had a rather strange look
on his face when he looked at Ning, almost as though he was looking
at some sort of monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh, Fellow Daoist.”
The attendant was noticeably more humble and respectful than he was
previously. “Can you please follow me this way?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant sent
mentally, “The Emperor has ordered for you to go meet him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Emperor?” Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Emperor, of
course… which is to say, Emperor Gonflame,” the attendant sent
back. He was truly puzzled. Normally, it was other major powers who
would attempt to request a meeting with Emperor Gonflame. Why was
Emperor Gonflame actively inviting this young World-level cultivator?
</P>

Chapter 44 – Emperor Gonflame
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame wished
to meet him? Ji Ning hesitated for a moment. He was nothing more than
a World-level cultivator. There was probably only one possible reason
why Emperor Gonflame wished to meet him in person…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame was
one of the retainers of the Paragon of Pills, while the Paragon had
an extraordinarily close relationship with Ning’s deceased Hegemon
master. Most likely, she could be considered his master’s wife,
almost like a godmother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lead the way,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” The
attendant immediately led the way forwards, but in his heart he
couldn’t help but feel puzzled at what the relationship was between
this young World-level cultivator and his Emperor was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant led Ning
forwards. A short while later, it was an Emperor-level retainer who
personally led the way for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
they reached an enormous, peaceful courtyard. There were two lakes
within the courtyard, one of which was filled with a blazing,
lava-like liquid. As for the second lake, it was filled with a
freezing liquid that was so cold as to cause the surrounding area to
be blanketed in frost. Between that blazing lake and the freezing
lake was an ancient, stunted-looking tree that was nonetheless large
in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath the tree, there
was a table, a chair, and a man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery-haired man’s
upper body was uncovered, and he sat there while weighing Ning with a
judging look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor,” the
retainer said respectfully, “Darknorth has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may leave,”
Emperor Gonflame instructed. The retainer immediately withdrew,
leaving behind only Ning and Emperor Gonflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior greets
you, Emperor.” Ning bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to stand on
ceremony with me, Darknorth. Come, sit.” Emperor Gonflame smiled
and gestured towards the seat opposite him. Seeing this, Ning
followed his gesture and sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have a taste. The
wine here was delivered to me by the various Daolords who have asked
me to help them create various treasures. I don’t even know the
names of half of the wine here, nor do I care. I’ve already spent
countless amounts of effort researching and analyzing the properties
of various materials and ingredients. I have no interest in doing the
same for my food and wine as well,” Emperor Gonflame said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I can
imagine how much effort it took for you to rise to the level of being
the number one artificer of this entire universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually happen to
like being an artificer. When I followed Master, I was nothing more
than one of her many disciples and retainers. I was a completely
unremarkable figure.” A reminiscent look was in Emperor Gonflame’s
eyes. “I was fairly slow in improving as a cultivator, but I really
did like working as an artificer, and so I poured all of my efforts
into this field instead. Who would’ve thought that I would end up
becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step, and then just naturally break
through to become an Eternal Emperor? Only later did I realize that
Master had been paying close attention to me in secret. She had
helped guide me and assist me on numerous occasions without me even
realizing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly sigh. For Emperor Gonflame to have gained eternity was
proof that if you truly devoted yourself to a particular trade or
craft, you could make miracles happen! But of course, that was also
only if you had a major power like the Paragon of Pills guiding your
path. The Paragon was one of the three ancient Primordial Starkings
who had existed since the birth of this universe, after all. Even
though she didn’t spend much time or effort on artificing, she
still ranked as one of the top three in this universe. For her to
help guide Emperor Gonflame in this was naturally quite simple for
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had just blindly
studied without having such a wise teacher, it was unlikely that he
would’ve been able to gain eternity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I noticed you as
soon as you arrived here.” Emperor Gonflame looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. You weren’t
overwhelmed with desire despite seeing so many treasures placed
before you. In the end, you chose a lifeblood weapon.” Emperor
Gonflame smiled and nodded. “Not bad. It seems you understand that
in order to become a truly powerful figure, you still have to rely on
your own power. To rely on strange curios and ancient artifacts…
that path is a path which rarely leads to becoming truly
unstoppable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are a sword
cultivator. The sword cultivators who truly were the dominant forces
of their era all relied on the nothing more than the sword in their
hands, or perhaps the powerful secret arts they might’ve come up
with,” Emperor Gonflame said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded,
understanding what was being imparted. In the ancient library of the
Sword Palace, he had seen quite a few secret arts and thus understood
that many of the more powerful Daolords relied on mighty secrets arts
they had developed. This was true for virtually all of the
monstrously talented ones!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most
terrifyingly powerful Daolords and Emperors all have their own unique
techniques.” Emperor Gonflame sighed. “Some Daolords have such
powerful abilities that even I would rather keep my distance from
them. For example, there is a Daolord I know named Daolord Otherpath
who used his own Dao to create a truly unearthly secret art. He
managed to completely merge himself into the Wugang Sea of Glass,
something which naturally formed from the primordial chaos. After
mastering the Wugang Glass Form, with but a thought he can transform
into the vast sea of glass and sent it surging towards you. Upon
being trapped by it… even someone like me would probably perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Still, it made sense. Shortly after leaving the Three
Realms, he had encountered Daolord Badlands. Although he was merely a
Daolord of the Third Step, his Numerancy divination powers were
simply too incredible. Whenever he divined that danger was near, he
would immediately slink away, making it almost impossible to kill
him. Even worse – if you offended him but were unable to kill him,
he would be able to divine all sorts of ways to deal with you or act
against your interests. This was why Daolord Badlands was actually
quite a dangerous person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those unearthly
Daolords have all trained their own Daos to an absolute apex, giving
them inconceivable amounts of power. Even worse, they all but seek
out excuses to try and kill an Emperor so as to establish their
reputations.” Emperor Gonflame shook his head and sighed. “Gaining
eternity is no easy feat, and yet the weaker Eternal Emperors are
hunted down so mercilessly that they don’t even dare to show their
faces in the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but grin. The same was true in the Endless Territories. Daolord
Allgod had chased Emperor Melobo across the entire universe, while
Lord Dawnstar of the Saber Palace had once slain an Eternal Emperor
with three blows of his saber! This was why there were so few Eternal
Emperors around, with the surviving ones all figures of incredible
strength. The three Hegemons of the Endless Territories were good
examples, as was Emperor Mirrorsnow who was extremely skilled at
staying alive. Emperor Trisilk was another figure who was also
skilled at survival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures,
bah… one or two is enough. If you spend all your efforts on
collecting magic treasures, you’ll never make it too far!”
Emperor Gonflame looked at Ning. “Although I am very wary of those
monstrously strong Daolords, I have to say that they have chosen the
correct path. If they succeed and gain eternity, they shall become
Hegemons amongst emperors. They’ll immediately be granted the
position of ‘Starking’ within the Church of Annihilation, and
they’ll be incredibly strong ones at that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but ask curiously, “Aren’t all the Starkings of the Church of
Annihilation at the Hegemon level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way. Impossible!”
Emperor Gonflame shook his head. “They are simply strong Eternal
Emperors who were chosen to become Starkings. If they were Hegemons,
they wouldn’t be ‘chosen’ as Starkings; they simply would BE
Starkings. Take Emperor Maniseal for example; I heard he’s
ridiculously powerful in the Dao of Seals, but he’s still a ways
off from the Hegemon level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or consider the
three Primordial Starkings. They always had transcendent statuses,
precisely because all three of them were Hegemons,” Emperor
Gonflame said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
So as he had expected, the Paragon of Pills was indeed a Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Paragon of Pills
is a truly incredible figure,” Emperor Gonflame said. “According
to the legends, she was a monster even back when she was merely a
Daolord, capable of killing Eternal Emperors with ease. Only after
gaining eternity did she become a Hegemon! However… there are no
absolutes. The legends supposedly say that a long, long time ago, she
wasn’t a Hegemon. Only after training for many years as an Eternal
Emperor did she reach the Hegemon level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Maniseal, in
turn, was once an unremarkable Emperor who completely focused on his
Dao of Seals. By now, he’s become incredibly powerful.” Emperor
Gonflame chuckled. “After you become an Emperor, you can still
slowly train your way up and become increasingly powerful, and you’ll
even have a shot at the Hegemon level. However… actually succeeding
in this endeavor is far too difficult. Countless years have gone by,
but the only person to succeed in doing so was the Paragon of Pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. Back
in the Brightshore Kingdom, he had heard that Hegemons were only
created when the most powerful of Daolords gained eternity! He never
would’ve imagined that the Paragon was actually an exception to the
rule. It really was an axiom that the path of cultivation was a path
where there would always be a ‘final chance’ given.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame
chatted with Ning for quite some time, broadening Ning’s horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, you want a
lifeblood weapon, right?” Emperor Gonflame looked at Ning, then
laughed. “That’ll be easy. This is our very first meeting, and so
I’ll gift you with a lifeblood weapon as my first meeting gift to
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.” Ning
revealed a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that there were
differences amongst freshly-forged lifeblood weapons. Some might be
incredibly heavy and would be suitable for ferocious stances such as
his Heavenbreaker stance. Others might be a better fit for his Blood
Drop stance or his Shadowless stance. But of course, lifeblood
weapons could be continuously improved and altered. Even if the
weapon didn’t start off as a good fit, as more time passed it would
become a better and better fit for its master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a lifeblood
treasure which started off as a perfect fit would naturally grow
powerful even faster. For the number one grandmaster artificer in
this universe to personally forge a lifeblood weapon for himself…
this truly was a rare opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor, please take
a look at this.” Ning immediately began to put his sword-arts on
display. “My Sword Dao is composed of five separate Supreme Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning put his
sword-arts on display, the watching Emperor Gonflame felt a sense of
tremendous shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what… you’ve
even linked them together perfectly? This is something which includes
all aspects of the entire Dao of the Sword!” Emperor Gonflame
stared at Ning. If this kid continues to grow and develop, he’ll
definitely become not just a powerful Daolord, but one of the most
monstrously powerful Daolords. He’ll probably be able to kill some
weaker Eternal Emperors with just one blow from his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor.” After
finishing displaying his sword-arts, Ning looked towards Emperor
Gonflame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um…” Emperor
Gonflame rubbed his chin. “Your lifeblood weapon would have to
reach the apex of perfection in every single aspect. It won’t be
easy to make, and it’ll require a lot of materials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would only cost him
around ten million cubes of chaos nectar if he wished to make a
lifeblood sword for an ordinary sword cultivator, and if he wished to
sell it on the open market it would probably go for around twenty or
thirty million cubes. But Darknorth’s Sword Dao was a Dao which
covered all types of sword-arts, a Dao which pursued true perfection.
The materials alone would probably cost him thirty million cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Well, since I
promised I’d forge you one, I’ll forge you one.” Emperor
Gonflame laughed. “I won’t go broke from just one weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor,” Ning
suddenly said, “This junior has a rather… outrageous request.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An outrageous
request?” Emperor Gonflame laughed. “Don’t be shy. Speak.” He
had just promised to give away thirty million cubes worth of precious
materials. Right now, he was feeling quite generous and magnanimous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
seen this junior’s sword-arts. To be honest… it’d be perfect if
I had six lifeblood swords. In that case, my power would multiply
many times over.” Ning said hurriedly, “But of course, this
junior wouldn’t dare to ask you to gift me with six… if there’s
anything you need, just tell me and I will do my utmost to accomplish
it. I also have some precious treasures and some chaos nectar. I
definitely would never ask you to operate at a loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly did deeply
desire six lifeblood weapons. He wanted six, no matter what it had to
cost him. Given how much face Emperor Gonflame was giving him, he’d
probably offer those six weapons at a very low cost. Logically
speaking, Ning felt he should be able to afford it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SIX?!!?” Emperor
Gonflame’s eyes bulged out. “Six LIFEBLOOD weapons? Your request
really is outrageous!”
</P>

Chapter 45 – Some Interesting Information
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just tell me how
much you need, Emperor,” Ji Ning said shamelessly. For a young
World-level cultivator like himself to be shameless in front of an
Eternal Emperor didn’t really matter that much. If it meant
acquiring six lifeblood weapons, a bit of thick-skinned shamelessness
was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame was
speechless. “Six lifeblood weapons. Let’s put aside the amount of
exhausting work that I’d have to put into it. Six lifeblood
weapons… do you even know how much the materials alone would cost?
Do you have any idea? You actually dare make the wild claim that
you’d cover it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much would it
cost, exactly?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To make customized
swords for you? Your swords would be different from all other
lifeblood weapons. Your Sword Dao encompasses all directions, which
means that the lifeblood weapon also has to be truly perfect in every
single aspect! The materials alone will probably cost at least three
times as much as the materials needed for an ‘ordinary’ lifeblood
weapon. It would take a total of thirty million cubes of chaos
nectar. Six swords would cost a hundred and eighty million cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame
suddenly started to laugh uncontrollably as he looked at Ning. “Fine,
I promised to give you one for free, so you’ll only have to
compensate me a hundred and fifty million cubes. As for all of my
time, effort, and labor… we’ll just consider it as being on the
house. Heh. Heh heh. You said you will make sure I’m not operating
at a loss, right? Can you give me that much?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. He
truly wasn’t able to say a single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred and fifty
million cubes?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was way, way…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky of
Vastheaven Palace was an extremely powerful Verge-level Daolord. In
order to procure the assistance of Daolord Badlands, he had put
together a collection of nearly twenty million cubes worth of chaos
nectar, which represented virtually his entire treasure hoard. But of
course, the treasures and weapons which he used in battle and which
was part of his own ‘true strength’, he naturally didn’t sell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For most major powers,
even if they sold off all of their most valuable treasures they still
probably wouldn’t be able to come up with a hundred million cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weeeell?” Emperor
Gonflame looked at Ning, then said teasingly, “Weren’t you
talking big, just now, about how you’d make it up to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was furiously
racking his brain for ideas. What should he do? He had quite a few
treasures, but he wasn’t even close to a hundred and fifty million
cubes worth of treasure. Emperor Gonflame wished to give the Paragon
of Pills face and so was willing to gift him thirty million cubes of
ingredients; this was already beyond generous. It must be remembered
that when Emperor Gonflame had made that offer, he had only been
planning on making an ordinary lifeblood weapon that would cost him
around ten million cubes. Who would’ve thought that Ning’s Sword
Dao was this incredible? Emperor Gonflame couldn’t go back on his
words, and so had been so generous as to promise Ning an appropriate
and even more expensive weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But six? Even Ning
himself felt that such a request went too far, and the Emperor
probably wouldn’t agree. Such a sum of wealth would cause even
someone like Emperor Gonflame to feel heartache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” A thought
suddenly flashed through Ning’s mind. “Emperor,” Ning called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame had
been enjoying the intensely awkward look on Ning’s face. He
couldn’t help but feel curious upon hearing Ning call out to him.
“What is it? Do you actually have enough treasure to make up for
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did, of course,
have enough treasure. The deceased Hegemon’s suit of ancient armor
alone was worth vastly more than six lifeblood weapons. That suit of
armor had been labored over by the Paragon of Pills herself, and it
truly was of inestimable value. There was nowhere and no way to buy a
treasure like that! As for the two Dao-seals which the deceased
Hegemon had given him, the deceased Hegemon had poured all of his
effort into the creation of each Dao-seal. They similarly could not
be found anywhere on any market, and they would indeed more than make
up for the lifeblood weapons as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning would never
sell them, not unless he truly lost his mind. Ultimate trump cards
like this simply were not to be sold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior has a
bit of information to trade,” Ning said. “I think… this bit of
information should be worth a hundred and fifty million cubes of
chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Information? What
sort of information could possibly be worth that much?” Emperor
Gonflame was intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor,” Ning
said, “When this junior first entered the Archaeus region, I once
accidentally encountered a place where I discovered an enormous,
mountain-sized vein of darkspace flamestone. This mountain was more
than a million kilometers in size.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame had
been quite calm, but upon hearing the words ‘million kilometers’
he was completely stunned. He shot to his feet, staring at Ning with
round eyes. “What did you just say? A million kilometers in size? A
mountain of darkspace flamestone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How rich is the
vein?” Emperor Gonflame asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ‘vein’ could mean
many things. A ‘vein’ of ore in which ten thousand kilograms of
rock held roughly one kilogram of pure ore would be considered a
‘vein’, but so too would a ‘vein’ in which a billion
kilograms of rock held a kilogram of pure ore! The difference between
the two, however, was enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please take a look,
Emperor.” Ning waved his hand, causing a piece of ore to appear.
This was one of the pieces of ore which the golem Moksha had mined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ore…”
Emperor Gonflame was instantly excited when he saw that piece of ore.
He was a true grandmaster of artificing, and he could immediately
tell right away that it came from an incredibly rich vein. “A
million kilometers of this… I… I… I’m not strong enough to
own such a mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mountain of ore
was so large and valuable that someone like him truly wasn’t
qualified to claim ownership over it. In fact, Emperor Gonflame
didn’t even consider trying. He was a retainer of the Paragon of
Pills, after all. There was no way he could hide something like this
from her. And a mine of this size… if the Paragon of Pills claimed
it, there would be no one who would dare to do anything to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But there is
something I must tell you. This mine already has an owner,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An owner?” Emperor
Gonflame was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Trisilk,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame
started to roar with laughter. “Ahahaha! Him? That poor, stupid
bastard?” Right now, Emperor Trisilk truly was the most unfortunate
Eternal Emperor in this entire universe. Emperor Maniseal was hunting
him so relentlessly that he didn’t dare to show his face anywhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, follow me. Let
us go meet with my master.” Emperor Gonflame grabbed Ning, then
stepped through the void and teleported out of his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This truly was a piece
of earth-shaking information. Even the Paragon of Pills was shocked
upon hearing it, and she immediately led Ning and Emperor Gonflame
away from the Trileaf Realm and towards the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five-colored space
bridge continuously soared into the distance. The Paragon, Ning, and
Emperor Gonflame all stood there atop the bridge. Since Ning had fled
from the Sacred Immortal Realm after they had destroyed the formation
protecting it, he knew exactly where it was located. This made
finding it much easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-garbed
Paragon put away her bridge, then stood there in the emptiness of
space with Emperor Gonflame and Ji Ning by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing flames in
this region weren’t able to even move close to them. The Paragon,
Emperor Gonflame, and Ning all stared through the void towards the
towering mountain formed from fiery red rock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
vein of ore.” Emperor Gonflame was truly stunned. “Although
Darknorth told me about how large it is, actually seeing it is…
wow. How could there be a mountain of darkspace flamestone as large
as this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s too large.
There’s no way to teleport it away. Our only choice is to slowly
mine it for its ore,” the Paragon said softly. A mountain of ore
like this… in this entire universe, the number of people who would
dare claim it for their own could be counted on one hand. The Paragon
was one of them! But of course, if someone else had been the first to
discover it, she wouldn’t have been in a good position to intervene
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoever was the first
to discover such a fortune would be the one to own it. This was a
shared rule which the supreme powers all abided by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if a
puny Emperor like Emperor Trisilk was the first to find it, the
supreme powers would’ve been in a position to take it away by
force! This was much like how Hydragon Mountain of the Endless
Territories had been forcibly occupied by the almighty Brightshore
Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trisilk, that idiot…
he probably wanted to keep this mountain for himself.” Emperor
Gonflame snickered. “He never would’ve expected that Emperor
Maniseal would chase after him like this. Poor bastard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trisilk is a
selfish, vicious person by nature. Of course he would want to keep
this mountain for himself.” The Paragon of Pills slowly shook her
head. “However… right now, there’s no one who can protect him.
Maniseal has gone completely berserk. Even if the lord of the Church
of Annihilation placed Trisilk under his personal protection, Trisilk
would still have to perpetually stay within the lord’s
headquarters. He would never be able to leave it ever again. If
Trisilk was to ever come out… given how furious Maniseal is, he’ll
definitely kill Trisilk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trisilk had been able
to sense his disciple being killed and knew that the secret of his
darkspace flamestone mine had been exposed. He was so terrified by
this that he hid himself even more deeply! Right now, his nerves were
completely frayed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A berserk Maniseal
truly was a terrifying person to behold. He had reached the true apex
in the Dao of Seals. Although he was a bit weaker than the Paragon of
Pills or the lord of the Church of Annihilation, neither of them
would wish to make an enemy out of him! This was because neither of
them felt confident that they would definitely be able to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
mountain of ore. The Trileaf Realm will need to make good use of it
and work hard to mine it.” The Paragon nodded. “The value of this
ore is truly incalculable. Gonflame, go ahead and help Darknorth
forge those six lifeblood weapons. I’ll provide all the materials
you need! For us to gain such a mountain of ore at a cost of less
than two hundred million cubes of chaos nectar… the more often
something like this happens, the better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Emperor
Gonflame laughed and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
couldn’t help but secretly sigh to himself. In truth, neither he
nor any of his fellows such as Solewind or Greatjoy had any designs
on this mountain! This was because not even most Eternal Emperors
would dare to lay claim over it! In addition, Emperor Trisilk already
knew about this place, which meant others would definitely find out
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the number of
people in this universe who could fearlessly and openly lay claim to
it truly could be counted on just one hand. Ning, Greatjoy, and the
others were all from another universe, and were mere World-level
cultivators; there was no way they would ever have a chance to meet
such supremely powerful figures! Even if they had such a chance, they
wouldn’t dare to act on it for fear of their true identities being
exposed! What’s more… for a weak figure like them to try and
bargain with such supremely powerful figures might simply result in
them being forcibly soulscoured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to their many
concerns, none of them had ever dared to reveal this secret to anyone
else upon leaving the Sacred Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, had a
very special relationship with the Paragon of Pills. She had treated
him very well, and had even transmitted her [Seven Leafpill Chapters]
to him. It could be said that they were family, which was why Ning
dared to tell her about this mountain. If it wasn’t for their
special relationship, Ning would’ve forever kept this information
hidden deep within his memories!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills,

darkspace flamestone. This was one of the many marvels birthed from
the primordial chaos in this universe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Emperor Gonflame suddenly said, “Six lifeblood weapons will take
quite a bit of time. Even if I enter my estate and accelerate time,
the smelting will still take tens of thousands of years. You’ll
have to wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alchemy, artificing,
seal-making, and other Daos all took enormous amounts of time. Major
powers would generally carry out the process within estates that had
temporal acceleration enchantments!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tens of thousands of
years?” Ning laughed. “Then I’ll just wait patiently for those
six lifeblood weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands of
years. This could be said to be a long period of time, but it could
also be said to be a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning’s group
had originally come to this alternate universe, their journey to the
Archaeus region alone had taken over ten thousand years! Even if he
was still in the Genesis Lands, it would take well over ten thousand
years to depart the Archaeus region and then start to head home.
Given he was in the Trileaf Realm, he wouldn’t need to traverse the
Archaeus region. In that respect, he had saved some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder when
Solewind, Greatjoy, and the others will leave the Genesis Lands,”
Ning murmured to himself within his residence in the Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Su Youji, she
remained at the outer reaches side of the primessence chains, quietly
waiting for Ning to return. Alas, it was guaranteed that she would
never see him there!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly six thousand
years after Ning’s ‘abduction’, Heartlord Solewind emerged from
the inner reaches and walked back to the outer reaches via the
chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Solewind.”
Firesurge and the others went to greet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Immortal
Swallowback greeted him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartlord Solewind,
have you seen my master?” Su Youji immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth? He
entered the inner reaches alongside me. Later on, we separated and
didn’t meet again. What’s wrong?” The bald Heartlord Solewind
was still dressed in the same loose, fiery-red robes he had been
dressed in thousands of years ago. He couldn’t help but feel
surprised by the question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji immediately
explained, “Six thousand years ago, I suddenly became unable to
sense my master’s presence, but his message-talisman is still
intact.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t sense
him?” Solewind’s face turned solemn as well. He had experienced
many dangers within the world of the inner reaches and had nearly
died as a result. In the end, though, he had survived and departed
with a great fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The inner reaches
are very difficult. It’s possible that brother Darknorth is trapped
within one of its danger zones.” Heartlord Solewind was rather
worried as well. “But… for there to be no news of him after six
thousand years probably means that he really is in grave danger.
Let’s wait for a while longer. He might still be alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another five thousand
years went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Prince Greatjoy
had also returned from the inner reaches. He hadn’t seen Ji Ning
either. This made Su Youji even more disappointed and worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than three
thousand years went by. Skyfire Brightshore finally rejoined the
others as well. And so… everyone but Ji Ning had returned. Prince
Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, Waterlord Firesurge, Skyfire
Brightshore, Immortal Swallowback, World Goddess Skywolf, Flamefairy
Su Youji… they were all present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were all fairly
lucky to make it out in one piece, but… brother Darknorth has gone
missing.” Prince Greatjoy frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s been missing
for quite some time…” Firesurge slowly shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is
definitely alive,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore
said, “But we can’t just wait for him. He’s already been
missing for ten thousand years. If we just keep waiting like this,
who knows how long we’ll be here for? I think we should go back. If
he’s still alive, he’ll go back as well once he comes out and
realizes that we aren’t here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind and Greatjoy
exchanged glances. Their mission was chiefly to escort and protect
Skyfire Brightshore! If Skyfire wished to go back, they really
couldn’t stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy, what
Skyfire says makes sense. If brother Darknorth is still alive, he’ll
go back on his own.” Solewind looked at Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And there’s no
point to you waiting here by yourself,” Greatjoy said. “And…
given how Darknorth suddenly disappeared, it’s also possible that
he’s already left the Genesis Lands. In fact, he might’ve already
gone back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gone back?” Su
Youji stared. That… actually was possible. The Genesis Lands were
filled with mysteries. It was entirely possible that some sort of
special place might’ve teleported Ji Ning to another place in the
universe. If that had actually happened, it wouldn’t make sense for
Ji Ning to slowly travel all the way through the Archaeus region a
second time! The Archaeus region was simply too large. Even someone
as skilled in the Dao of Spacetime as Prince Greatjoy would need
nearly ten thousand years to traverse if. If Ji Ning wished to
traverse it, it would take him far longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps brother
Darknorth really did encounter a special situation, resulting in him
going back to our universe,” Solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us return
together. Darknorth is far stronger than you; he’s entirely capable
of making it back on his own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy, we just
might see Darknorth once we go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all urged her to
return with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all honesty, the
many centuries of waiting had taken their toll on the Flamefairy as
well, making her feel increasingly nervous. She also felt that it was
entirely possible that Ji Ning really had encountered a special event
that resulted in him being thrust out of the Archaeus region, and so
she immediately nodded. “Alright. Let’s go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of them had
reaped great rewards within the Genesis Lands! This was also the
reason why they felt certain that Ji Ning had probably encountered
something special as well. In the Genesis Lands, everything truly was
possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy,
Heartlord Solewind, and the others spent merely three thousand years
before they were able to reach the transversal conduit and return to
the Endless Territories. Clearly, Prince Greatjoy’s mastery over
the Dao of Spacetime had increased dramatically, allowing them to
travel much more quickly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon returning to
the Brightshore Kingdom, they found out that Ji Ning had yet to
return! Su Youji was stunned by this news. She had no choice but to
return to the Sword Palace of the Twelve Palaces and quietly wait
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alternate universe.
The Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way for
Ning to reach out to Greatjoy and the others. All he could do was
patiently wait for those six lifeblood weapons to be forged. Only
then could he leave the Trileaf Realm and return to the Endless
Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, he did have
to go back. His family and his friends were all back there, as was
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
The waters of the ocean lapped against the sandy beaches, then
receded again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position on the beach, his Immortal energy flowing as countless
divine runes manifested around him. He was training in the
pill-making techniques of the seventh chapter of the [Seven Leafpill
Chapters].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a chubby
figure flew over, a look of excitement on the man’s face. “Master,
I’ve already completely mastered the second chapter you bestowed
upon me!” World God Pillsaint excitedly went straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning
dispelled his Immortal energy, then looked at Pillsaint. “Then go
ahead and produce a ‘Thousand Songs’ pill for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousand Songs pill
could be made very quickly, but it was a very complicated pill. It
required fine control over a thousand different processes, each of
which required tremendous skill and had exacting requirements. The
first five chapters of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] all used the
‘Thousand Songs’ pill as a way to test whether or not someone had
successfully mastered a particular chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, the
pill-making process took a total of two days. Pillsaint had always
been talented in the Dao of Alchemy, but he was now at least ten
times better than he had been prior to coming to the Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well. I’ll
bestow the third chapter upon you. Do your best to master it. If you
can master it… a true fortune might very well be awaiting you,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A true fortune? What
type of fortune?” Pillsaint was quite curious. In recent years, he
had been completely focused on training in alchemy within Ning’s
estate-world. He had never wandered the Trileaf Realm, and so he had
never heard of the Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point telling you
just now.” Ning shook his head. Even if Pillsaint did master the
third chapter, it was up to the Paragon of Pills as to whether or not
she wished to teach him more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
was an exalted figure with incredibly high expectations. All Ning
could do was recommend potential apprentices to her. As to whether or
not Pillsaint would be able to grasp this opportunity, that was
completely up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Ning waved his
finger, tapping Pillsaint on his forehead and imparting the third
chapter of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely
incredible! The person who created this alchemy method is absolutely
incredible. I’ve only been learning from it for a short period of
time, but my improvements in the Dao of Alchemy have been
ridiculously high. I can sense that if I make just a few more
breakthroughs, I can become a Daolord whenever I choose.” Pillsaint
was extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning warned softly,
“Remember our oath!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint was stunned,
then immediately nodded. Before returning to the Brightshore Kingdom,
they absolutely could not afford to break through into the Daolord
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life in the Trileaf
Realm was quite relaxed. Ning had never been this relaxed before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he had
been wholly focused on the Dao of the Sword, but he had now
completely mastered and linked together his five different Supreme
Sword Daos. He could now completely relax, and in fact he had the
vague feeling that relaxing was the correct decision. This was why he
spent all his time within his estate-world, where the flow of time
was a hundred times faster than the ‘normal’ rate of time. Thus,
tens of thousands of years in ‘real’ time translated into
millions of years of accelerated time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty thousand years
of ‘real’ time went past in the blink of an eye within the
Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wild wind was blowing
through the estate-world today. The waves of the sea were rolling
forwards, with Ning seated leisurely atop the waves, watching as they
rose and fell. In the stormy skies, the silhouette of a single sword
could be seen flickering through various different sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned. “My sword arts… I feel as though…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent over
three million years relaxing in his estate-world after mastering and
linking together his five Supreme Daos. Now, all of a sudden, Ning
felt as though his sword-arts were still lacking in some manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This… this still
isn’t the ultimate Dao of the Sword!” This thought suddenly
flashed through Ning’s mind. After three million years of training
in sword-arts, he suddenly had this premonition. For people who had
trained to this level, these premonitions were usually highly
accurate.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_47___Kindness_and_Gratit"></A>
Chapter 47 – Kindness and Gratitude
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still missing
something.” Ji Ning frowned as he sat there atop the wave, the
sword silhouette in the air continuing to execute sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t make
sense. I’ve clearly mastered all five Supreme Daos and joined them
together perfectly.” Ning tested his sword-arts out repeatedly. “So
why is it that I feel like I’m lacking something?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly am I
missing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Again and again and
again, Ning used his sword to execute his various sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BAH!” He spent
five nights and five days testing things out, only to make no
improvements at all. Ning couldn’t help but let out a rather
frustrated howl, his voice reverberating within the skies of this
estate-world. The wavy waters of the entire sea suddenly fell flat
and turned completely still, almost as if it had been frozen in
place. Not a single wave could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning drew a
long breath, allowing the frozen seas to return to normal and the
waves to arise once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps I’m being
a bit too impatient,” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was not
to be blamed. He had felt certain that he had already found his
strongest Supreme Daos, but now he suddenly had the feeling that his
Sword Dao was still lacking in something. This meant his Supreme Dao
wasn’t actually ‘supreme’. Of course he was irritated by this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to notice
flaws in my Sword Dao is a good thing. It’s certainly better than
not even realizing my own imperfection.” Ning regained his normal
calm. “I should focus on calmly meditating on my sword-arts again.
Perhaps when enough time, I’ll be able to naturally break through
to the next level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My five Supreme Daos
are already joined together perfectly. If I can make another
breakthrough…” Ning was puzzled. “I’ve never even heard of
something like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu, Eastcult, and
the other monstrously talented geniuses all generally mastered
multiple Supreme Daos, then fitted them together perfectly. This
represented the utmost apex of power. This was what many major powers
all believed to be true! Previously, Ning had believed it to be true
as well… but now, he suddenly discovered that it wasn’t
necessarily the apex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent even more of
the coming years on his sword-arts, but of course he spent some time
on the pill-making techniques of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, more than fifty
thousand years had gone past since his initial entry into the Trileaf
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
mastered it. How truly inconceivable! At the World level, I’ve
actually managed to master the quadressence thunder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
peak of a mountain, his eyes flashing. Instantly, a streak of golden
lightning shot out of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This bolt of golden
lightning was filled with an aura of sharpness. This was Ning’s
newly created quadressence thunder! When Ning had first started to
train in alchemy, he had been able to immediately master the
tri-essence thunder and the quadressence water. Now that he had spent
five million years of accelerated time training in alchemy, he had
made tremendous strides in this field. In pill-making, Ning was
superior to even Pillsaint. Pillsaint was still working on the third
chapter, after all. Ning was working on the seventh chapter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Allgod once
said that a Daolord of the First Step would have a chance at
mastering the tri-essence thunder.” Ning laughed. “I’m at the
World level, but I’ve actually mastered the quadressence thunder.
Haha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His azureflower mist
energy was comparable to a Daolord’s energy, and his pill-making
arts were absolutely unearthly as well. This was why he was able to
produce such miraculous results.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, I have
quadressence thunder and quadressence water.” Ning willed them all
to come out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling bolt of
golden lightning and a crystalline stream of jade green water
instantly filled the skies, transforming into an incomparably
terrifying domain of sword-intent! The Yin-Yang Sword Domain was now
definitely Ning’s most powerful killer attack. The quadressence
thunder and the quadressence water could unleash ruinously powerful
attacks that would heavily injure even Daolords of the Second Step.
When they were used in this domain of sword-intent… they could
actually wipe those second step Daolords out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, Ning truly had
reached his limit in terms of controlling lightning and water. He had
no chance at all of completing pentessence water; most likely, he
would have to first become a Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly a thousand
years passed after Ning had mastered his quadressence thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master! I’ve
succeeded. I’ve succeeded!” World God Pillsaint came flying in
search of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” After
ascertaining that Pillsaint had indeed completely mastered the third
chapter, Ning immediately led Pillsaint out of his estate-world,
taking him to pay a visit to the Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but shiver when he saw that dark, icy-cold estate. He couldn’t help
but sigh as well. Why did the Paragon have to live by herself in a
place like this? Why?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning lamented
silently, he led Pillsaint into the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
was seated in the lotus position before the enormous pill cauldron,
her black gauzy robes spread across her and over the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
Paragon glanced at Ning, her gaze turning much gentler than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Paragon,”
Ning said respectfully. As for Pillsaint, he obediently fell to his
knees and kowtowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit,” the Paragon
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although she told them
to sit, in reality they merely sat on the ground in the lotus
position as well. Pillsaint snuck a glance at the Paragon, but didn’t
dare to stare directly at her. He simply felt rather puzzled… he
could clearly see her, but why was it that he kept on feeling as
though he couldn’t make out her features?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Paragon,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t mind,
you can simply address me as ‘Mistress’,” the Paragon of Pills
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress,” Ning
called out obediently. He already had a vague understanding of what
the relationship between the Paragon and the deceased Hegemon had
been like, and also understood how the Paragon felt about him as a
result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
nodded. “Have you brought this young fellow to me because of the
[Seven Leafpill Chapters]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “He is
my retainer, World God Pillsaint. I have already transmitted the
first three chapters to him, and he has mastered them all. That is
why I have brought him here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then refine a
cauldron of Thousand Songs pills.” The Paragon glanced at
Pillsaint, her eyes quite calm. She didn’t really care that much
about so-called ‘alchemy geniuses’; Hegemons rarely were very
eager to take on new disciples. They themselves could live for
countless years; why would they have to find people to teach their
skills to?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only truly exceptional
geniuses that they also took a personal liking to would be accepted
as disciples. She treated Ning in a very special manner, and as a
result she held a certain fondness for those connected to him. This
was why she was willing to give Pillsaint a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Pillsaint
understood that this moment was a moment which could change his
destiny. In truth, as soon as he saw that enormous lake of chaos
nectar he had been rather stunned. He immediately began to work on
refining pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint was extremely
careful, and his cauldron of pills was quite good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad. Darknorth,
how long did your retainer need in order to master the three
chapters?” Pillsaint asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s been in my
estate-world this entire time, where time moves a hundred times
faster than normal. Thus… he should’ve spent more than five
million ‘accelerated’ years,” Ning answered honestly. Lying in
front of a major power like her would be utterly stupid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
frowned slightly. More than five million years to just learn three
chapters? Given her standards, this was fairly slow! She generally
only accepted the most elite of disciples, people like Bertulu or Ji
Ning. Although Pillsaint was extremely talented in alchemy, he still
wasn’t quite at her mark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can become one
of my honorary disciples, I suppose.” The Paragon said calmly, “I
shall transmit the first six chapters of the [Seven Leafpill
Chapters] to you. Swear an oath to never disseminate it to others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Pillsaint
was actually overjoyed. Being able to learn the first six chapters
was already quite incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon bestowed a
golden medallion upon him, and it immediately merged into his body
once he touched it, filling his mind with certain memories as well as
forcing him to involuntarily swear a lifeblood oath. Clearly, the
Paragon wasn’t being nearly as gentle with him as she had been with
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
After fully memorizing the technique, Pillsaint was absolutely
delighted. He immediately kowtowed respectfully to express his
gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first six chapters
alone would still allow Pillsaint to vastly outstrip Daolord Allgod
in alchemy. Many of the pill formulas included within the first six
chapters were actually pills which only Eternal Emperors could
create.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the seventh
chapter, it contained the Paragon’s most elite techniques. She
wouldn’t casually teach it to outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are Darknorth’s
retainer, yes? Make sure you serve him loyally. If you betray him, do
not blame me for showing you no mercy,” the Paragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Pillsaint said respectfully. In truth, he could tell
that this opportunity was most likely all thanks to the Paragon’s
relationship with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Mistress.” Ning felt gratitude as well. The Paragon of Pills truly
did treat him well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gonflame should be
able to complete your lifeblood weapons within another ten thousand
years.” The Paragon looked at Ning. “My divinations are
whispering to me that you probably leave upon acquiring those
weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divinations
indicate that once you leave, it will be a long, long time before the
two of us ever meet again!” The Paragon said. “Thus… you must
be very careful on your path of cultivation. If you encounter any
serious issues, you can use my name to warn those who would harm you.
It might be of some use. Also… true major powers have all types of
abilities. Don’t rely too much on any single type of life-saving
measure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example… my
calculations indicate that you have a Primaltwin. However, certain
major powers who wish to kill you can use certain karma techniques to
completely annihilate your truesoul, be it that of your true body or
your Primaltwin,” the Paragon said. “Karma techniques are
extremely formidable, and have effects similar to that of lifeblood
oaths. They can follow those secret, hidden connections and wipe out
the truesouls of all of your clones and bodies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel speechless and amazed upon hearing this. Once a lifeblood
oath was violated, all bodies would be annihilated, true… but there
were actually attack techniques that could achieve the same results?
This was utterly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, you
shall understand how powerful the ‘major powers’ truly are,”
the Paragon said. “Thus, you absolutely must be careful in your
path of cultivation. That way, the two of us might have a chance to
meet again in the future. You may go now. It won’t be necessary for
you to come and say farewell to me when you leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Mistress.”
Ning respectfully fell to his knees, expressing his gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had only
met each other a few times, Ning could sense that the Paragon of
Pills truly held nothing back from him and did not plot against him
at all. She truly was doing what she thought was best for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his mind, Ning
viewed her as he would a close friend or a beloved senior. He
silently memorized the kindnesses she had shown him. For now, though,
he was still very weak. Repay her kindness? That was something for
the distant future.

Chapter 48 – The Return
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After bidding the
Paragon farewell, Ji Ning couldn’t help but feel slightly
emotional. After this parting, who knew how long it would be for them
to meet again? The Paragon of Pills lived in a different universe,
after all. Ning would be living in the Endless Territories! Alas, he
had to go back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than sixty
thousand years after he had arrived in the Trileaf Realm, Emperor
Gonflame sent a servant to carry a message to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Gonflame
wishes to meet me?” Ning revealed a look of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as the
Emperor left his estate-world, he immediately ordered me to come meet
you, fellow Daoist.” The extremely muscular azure-garbed Daolord
continued, “Fellow Daoist, please follow me over right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go
right away.” Ning had been waiting impatiently for some time now.
He had spent more than sixty thousand years for the sake of this
lifeblood weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of light
shot through the skies, heading straight towards Emperor Gonflame’s
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Gonflame’s
estate was at the margins of the Trileaf Realm. However, there were
many cultivators here. Emperor Gonflame’s treasures were simply too
alluring; even though most of the cultivators couldn’t afford to
actually by them, just having the chance to look at them was a chance
for them to expand their horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please come this
way.” The azure-garbed Daolord led Ning straight into the estate,
and they soon arrived in a private courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ve
brought Darknorth to you,” the azure-robed Daolord said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go.
Darknorth, come, sit.” Emperor Gonflame was seated, a proud smile
on his face. Each time he forged some treasures he particularly
liked, he would always feel a bit smug. He always did enjoy forging
treasures, and it was that genuine affection for his art, combined
with his incredible talent as well as the guidance of the Paragon of
Pills, which led him to become the number one artificer of this
entire universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suppressed his
excitement and sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at you. I bet
the only thing you care about right now are those swords.” Emperor
Gonflame started to laugh. “Alright, I’ll stop teasing you. Look.
These are your six lifeblood weapons.” As he spoke, he waved his
hand and caused a pitch-black scabbard to appear next to him, with
six swords ‘folded’ together inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One scabbard, six
swords.” Emperor Gonflame smiled. “You can carry all of them at
the same time. Lifeblood weapons are unlike other weapons. These are
freshly forged, and they don’t even have Sword Dao quintessences
withim them. They are completely fresh and blank slates; they don’t
even have sword-spirits yet. Thus, they’ll be relying on you to
pour your own Sword Dao into them to form their quintessences and
give birth to their sword-spirits. How far they will be able to
develop will be completely up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
pitch-black scabbard hovering before him and the six swords within
them. Ning waved his hand. Whoosh! Instantly, the six swords all flew
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single sword
seemed quite ordinary. The blades were very thin but also incredibly
sharp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind them first.”
Emperor Gonflame looked at Ning. “You do know how to bind lifeblood
swords, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fill them with my
own blood and nourish them with my own spirit, right?” Ning asked.
He was a sword cultivator, after all. Although acquiring lifeblood
weapons was quite difficult, he did know how one should bind one if
one was lucky enough to acquire one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Emperor
Gonflame nodded. “Work hard and take care of those swords. As for
the scabbard, you don’t need to spend any effort on it. It’s
nothing more than an ordinary top-grade Eternal treasure, with no
special properties. I just casually made it into a shape that fits
the swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scabbard and the
six swords hovered in front of Ning. Ning stretched out his hand, a
wound suddenly appearing within his palm. Blood immediately spurted
out. Under Ning’s control, the blood flew out in six streams and
covered all six of those swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six swords were all
pitch-black in color. Like nursing babies, they absorbed Ning’s
fresh blood. The blood spread out over them like a spider web as more
and more of it was absorbed into the swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Ning, blood was
nothing more than a manifestation of his divine power. After using up
more than half of his divine power, his six swords were finally
‘full’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning sent out
strands of his divine will towards those six swords. The six swords
had absorbed much of Ning’s blood, which contained both his divine
power as well as tiny parts of his truesoul. As a result, the swords
naturally wouldn’t resist Ning’s will, allowing it burrow deep
within their ‘bodies’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine will
completely surrounded the six swords, almost like the embrace of a
mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly… the six
swords began to change internally in a dramatic fashion, almost like
how Pangu had been born from the primordial chaos. The six swords
were already filled with Ning’s blood. Now, under the guidance and
nurturing power of Ning’s soul and will, they began to gain
sentience. In truth, this sentience was akin to that of a living
being’s; they would be intelligent, grow, and even cultivate
independently. This was what the giant bear of Daoist Threelives’
Starseizing Manor had done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One voice after another
cried out as child-like figures began to appear from the surfaces of
the six swords. Because of Ning’s own soul and truesoul having
influenced their creation, they were born looking like human
children.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them seemed
quite puzzled. As ‘newborns’ who had just come into existence,
they didn’t even know how to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hello, kids.” When
Ning saw those six sword-spirits arise, he suddenly sensed a powerful
sense of kinship towards them. In the past, whenever he had bound
magic treasures he would be connected to them as well, but those were
just ordinary connections. This time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a feeling almost
akin to when he had first seen his daughter Brightmoon. It was a
connection that came from the deepest parts of his truesoul, a true
connection on the most basic of levels. He felt almost like a father
towards them! This was another reason why these weapons were referred
to as ‘lifeblood’ weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be good now.” Ning
smiled as he looked at the six of them. They all looked like babies,
and all of them were completely naked. Ning laughed as he used his
divine will to convey some information to them. In the end, they
weren’t mortal children; they grew and learned quite quickly. As
soon as Ning sent them some information, they almost immediately
learned how to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, so you are our
master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six young fellows
all began to call out simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel a bit helpless. Although they had quickly mastered the
concept of language, it would take time for them to grow more
intelligent. Right now, they were too young and too innocent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
you will be ranked in accordance with how quickly you woke up. So
you’ll be number one, you’ll be number two, you’ll be number
three…” Ning gave all of them rankings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Emperor
Gonflame started to laugh. “Darknorth, have you started to view
them as your own children?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. They
were just swords, right? But indeed, he had given them a ‘birth
order’ as he might’ve given actual children.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many major powers
will treat their lifeblood weapons as their own children.” Emperor
Gonflame sighed. “It isn’t surprising at all. In the future,
it’ll be up to you to help them grow and become stronger. The
relationship between you and your swords will only strengthen and
deepen. A tiny number of incredible lifeblood weapons will break
through to the Universe level, but those Universe treasures will
still feel tremendous love and affection for their first master. This
is why.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly. The
Universe sword belonging to the deceased Hegemon of the sword refused
to accept Ning, precisely because it wanted to choose someone whose
personality was more similar to the Hegemon’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
the six of them shall forever be by your side. They shall venture
into battle by your side and brave danger with you,” Emperor
Gonflame said. “Treat them well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
looked at his six swords. This was the first time he truly felt as
though his magic treasures were his family members.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The six of you…
you shall be called the Northbow swords,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northbow. North,
because his own Daoist title was Darknorth. Bow, because
‘Rainbowflame Fairy’ was Yu Wei’s Daoist title. His greatest
ambition, his purpose behind wanting to become stronger and reach the
apex, was in large part because he wanted to bring her back to life.
If it hadn’t been for her… even though he would still pursue the
path of a cultivator, he wouldn’t be as frenzied as he currently
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Northbow swords in
hand, he would carve a grand path for himself through the thistles
and thorns that filled the path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northbow swords?
Then I’ll be Boss Northbow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I like that name!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be Northbow
Three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be Northbow
Four!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all called out,
one after the other. However… the final sword, ‘Northbow Six’,
just shook his head and let out a disdainful snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked, then
started to laugh. He then sent out his will, causing his sword-intent
to pour into the six swords. Ning’s five Supreme Daos began to link
together once more as his sword-intents joined together, coiling into
the six swords and transforming into their quintessence cores.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the auras of
the six swords expanded dramatically. Their auras exploded outwards
in an awe-inspiring fashion, and the six young fellows revealed looks
of delight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Ning
willed it, instantly causing all six swords to fly into the scabbard
on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, in terms
of quality they are already comparable to top-grade Eternal weapons,”
Emperor Gonflame said. “However, they will continue to grow and
advance towards the Universe level. Although it is incredibly
difficult for lifeblood treasures to grow to become Universe
treasures, they’ll continue to strengthen as they grow. Thus,
they’ll need to consume various types of materials and ingredients.
It’ll be up to you to provide them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
smiled and nodded. “Helping raise them is part of my
responsibilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, right. ‘Raise’
them well.” Emperor Gonflame smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor, I won’t
thank you because mere words will not suffice. I bid you farewell,”
Ning said gratefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Emperor
Gonflame nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day, Ning had
Daolord Yuhong guide him out of the Trileaf Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is a star map
of our universe. Our Trileaf Realm has three spacetime tunnels that
lead to three different parts of this universe,” Daolord Yuhong
explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chose the tunnel
that led to an exit closest to the place he had to go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s the
spacetime tunnel which Master constructed. She is the only one
capable of creating spacetime tunnels which traverse virtually the
entirety of our universe.” Daolord Yuhong pointed at the enormous,
pitch-black vortex up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
turned his head to stare off into the distance, then stepped into the
black vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that very moment, a
cold, black-garbed figure was standing outside the Paragon’s
estate. The black-garbed Paragon of Pills stared off into the
distance. She was able to see the white-robed youth with the black
scabbard on his back, and she watched as he stepped into the
spacetime tunnel and departed her Trileaf Realm.
