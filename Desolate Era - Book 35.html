Chapter 1 - Realmship
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Endless
Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dimensional gateway
was suddenly torn in the empty void open next to an enormous, blazing
star. A white-robed youth and a silver-robed man stepped out from
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re back! Haha,
we’re back in the Endless Territories.” Ninedust laughed
jubilantly, “We travelled through the Great Dark for so long
without seeing any other living creatures at all. We didn’t even
see any stars or chaosworlds. That sense of loneliness was truly
stifling and oppressing. I can’t help but shiver when I think about
how those Eternal Emperors choose to spend a million years traversing
the Great Dark enroute to another realmverse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once we succeed in
our Daomerges and gain eternal life, perhaps we might come to the
same decision.” Ji Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes… we have to
succeed in the Daomerge. We have to! We made a killing off our visit
to the Stone Hellephant Wall; to me, this place was just as
beneficial as the Waveshift Realm was.” Ninedust was in high
spirits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well. He
had indeed gained greatly from this trip. The greatest benefit lay in
how they had the chance to memorize the Dao-guidance left behind by
that Autarch. Next came the verdant azuresoul Ning had acquired and
those six Emperor-class golems… and then there were the various
Sithe relics they had swept out of the Sithe ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, that
realmship we found was damaged. Otherwise, we really would’ve won a
fortune,” Ninedust sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t just
damaged, it was in pieces. It would’ve been wonderful if Autarch
Bolin had held back just a little bit and didn’t destroy the
shuttle.” Ning sighed as well. “Still… if he really hadn’t
destroyed it, he probably would’ve taken it with him when he left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninedust
felt resigned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realmships… according
to what the golems Ning had captured and bound had told them, these
were flying shuttles that had been created by the Sithe which allowed
them to travel between realmverses. Using these vessels, it was
possible to spend less than a hundred thousand years in travelling
from one realmverse to another! To powerful cultivators, this was a
negligibly short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Hegemons found the
trip from one realmverse to another a taxing one which required an
extremely long period of time. Realmships, however, were able to
accomplish it in a fraction of the time. They truly were incredibly
fast, which meant they were incredibly precious as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been more
than thirty thousand Sithe within the Stone Hellephant Wall, but only
the two highest-ranking Sithe owned realmships, one each. One had
been taken away by Autarch Bolin, while the other had been destroyed
in the fierce fighting. Because realmships possessed regenerative
capabilities, some of its parts had managed to slowly recover… but
alas, the other parts were so totally trashed that they were
completely unable to heal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two parts of
the shuttle which were in fairly good shape. Ning and Ninedust had
each taken one of the two parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity how severe
the damage was. Less than half of it was remaining. There’s no way
to use it at all.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We would’ve struck
it rich if it was usable,” Ninedust sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not get too
greedy,” Ning replied. The two continued to chat while separating
themselves from the surrounding area, ensuring that no one was able
to hear their conversation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golems they had
bound had all existed since the days of the Sithe. They naturally
knew a great deal about the Sithe race! Ning and Ninedust learned a
great deal after interrogating the golems, including many Sithe
secrets. At first, they hadn’t really even understood how important
the realmship fragments they had collected were; it was only after
the golems helped them sort through the treasures that they knew what
a realmship was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, didn’t
we agree to go to the Aeonian Kingdom? This doesn’t seem to be the
right way,” Ninedust said with some surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re taking a
slight detour,” Ning said. “It’ll only take a day or two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something you need
to take care of?” Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us have
been visiting some truly extraordinary places recently. Although
we’re both confident in our skills, it’s also true that we can
die at any moment.” Ning sighed. “I’m planning to leave a few
of these Emperor-class golems behind in my homeland. That way, even
if I do fail my Daomerge and perish, my homeland will be at least
somewhat protected with those Emperor-class golems present.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust felt a mixed
bag of emotions upon hearing this. He asked, “Darknorth, is your
homeland very weak?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I can be
considered the strongest person from my homeland, I suppose,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms…
hundreds of millions of years had gone past, and it had grown quite a
bit… but it was still quite young in the grand scheme of things.
Thus far, it didn’t even have any other Samsara Daolords aside from
Ning himself! How could Ning not focus his attention on it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s quite a
heavy burden to bear.” Ninedust sighed. “I’ve never had that
sort of experience before. Although I acquired six Emperor-class
golems, they really don’t mean that much to the Ancient cultivators
as a race. These are all fairly weak Emperor-class golems, after
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancients are one
of the six major powers of the Endless Territories. If you had to be
responsible for the entire Ancient race, you would have to at least
be a Hegemon,” Ning teased. “If the Three Realms could ever rise
to become one of the top organizations of the Endless Territories, I
would feel plenty proud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning and
Ninedust emerged from yet another void tunnel, with a black-robed
Ning standing at the other end of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ninedust stared at the distant black-robed Ning with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin,”
Ning explained. Not even the Dao Alliance or the Brightshore Kingdom
knew that he had a Primaltwin; Ning had never made it public before!
However, Ninedust was his friend for life; why should he hide it from
Ninedust?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwin?”
Ninedust was stunned. “You have a Primaltwin? I’ve never heard of
this before.” Moments later, he felt extremely moved; the existence
of a Primaltwin was definitely a huge secret which generally wouldn’t
be made public.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You hid this very
well indeed! I really can’t help but envy you. We Ancient
cultivators are never able to have a Primaltwin,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwins can only
be created when you start cultivating as a mortal. All of you Ancient
cultivators are born at the World level; how could you possibly have
one?” Ning sighed. “Countless mortal cultivators would dream of
one day reaching the World level, but you start off being born at
this level with bodies comparable to Daolords… and you complain
about envying us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning spoke, he flew
towards his black-robed Primaltwin. He sent a jade gourd flying out
towards the Primaltwin. His Primaltwin accepted it, turned and tore
open a spacetime tunnel, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade bottle held a
total of six Emperor-class golems, the Sithe disk, and some other
treasures. Emperor-class golems were of some use to Ning, after all,
which was why he kept half for himself and gave half to the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending thirty
more years traversing through the Brightshore Kingdom’s pathways,
Ning and Ninedust finally reached the Aeonian Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonian
Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust stood
atop a chaos planet, staring off into the distance. At the opposite
end of the vast void was an enormous, roling sea of blood. Above the
sea of blood was an enormous citadel that glowed with dazzlingly
beautiful golden light. This castle had to be trillions of kilometers
in size and emanated an aura of unspeakable power that washed out in
every direction. Even at Ning and Ninedust’s current level of
power, they felt a breathtaking sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This… this was the
Aeonian Kingdom! It was this great castle which had kept the Aeonians
alive for so long. Not even Hegemons would dare to barge into the
Aeonian Kingdom, the homeland of the Aeonians!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve always heard
of how mysterious the Aeonian Kingdom is, but I’ve never had a
chance to actually enter it,” Ninedust snickered. “I now finally
have a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the Autarch’s
medallion resonating with anything?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It started to do so
half a year ago,” Ninedust laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why didn’t you
tell me? I kept on pulling you closer and closer through spacetime
teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to get an
up-close view of the Aeonian Kingdom with my own eyes. It really is
rather stunning.” Ninedust stared at the view before him
contentedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I spent the past
half year doing all that for nothing, eh?” Ning enjoyed the view as
well. The Aeonian Kingdom truly was a stunning and beautiful site to
behold. The two viewed it carefully for quite some time before
deciding to go inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ninedust waved
his hand, pulling Ning into his estate-world. He then held the
Autarch’s medallion up high as he activated the power within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An exalted aura
of blood-colored power covered Ninedust. Swoosh! It tore straight
through spacetime, causing him to instantly disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aeonian Kingdom was
a place filled with many secrets. The most mysterious, secretive
place was within a certain world. This was a place which even the
Aeonians found difficult to enter… and each time they did manage to
enter, they had to first pay an enormous price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A rift suddenly
appeared in the void above this mysterious world. Swoosh! The
Ninedust Sectlord’s figure flew out from the rift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We arrived.”
Ninedust scanned his surroundings, rather puzzled. His face suddenly
tightened. He waved his hand, causing a white-robed youth to appear
next to him. “We’ve already been teleported inside, Darknorth.
Look over there, quick!” Ninedust pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed his gaze,
only to see an absolutely enormous and dazzling astral river. There
was a flying vessel within the flows of the astral river, and in
front of the vessel was a strange tower-shaped flying object. At the
very tip of the tower there were three royal thrones and three onyx
humanoids seated atop them. The tower had a total of nine levels, and
each level had silver-robed Daolords standing on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of three
hundred of those silver-robed Daolords could be seen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe?” Ning
was rather surprised.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_2___Bazu"></A>
Chapter 2 - Bazu
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel and
the strange tower were facing each other. Atop the tower were three
onyx figures and three silver-robed Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, something’s
wrong.” Ji Ning and Ninedust quickly noticed how something was off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their auras seem
off. They don’t seem like the Sithe we saw before,” Ning said
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look,” Ninedust said. Ning agreed, and the two began to quietly
creep forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they moved closer
and closer, the two were able to see the stone stele hanging right
next to the flying vessel. “That stele…?” Ning and Ninedust
hurriedly inspected it, quickly recognizing and reading the
characters on the stone stele. The stele said:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I am Bolin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I had five personal
disciples. My fifth disciple, Bazu, was the most talented and the
strongest of the five, far surpassing ordinary Hegemons. However, he
was the first to die by the hands of the Sithe, and he was actually
the third Hegemon to perish after the Sithe revealed their fangs and
claws. In that battle, the Sithe sent out an entire regiment
commanded by three of their Black Emperors to ambush and kill my
disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that battle, my
disciple Bazu slew a hundred and twenty-six Silver Daolords and a
Black Emperor, but in the end he was surrounded and slain as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although I hurried to
him as fast as I could, I still arrived just a bit too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now… war has
begun! If our cultivator civilizations are defeated in this war, my
hope is that our many worlds will continue to give birth to more and
more cultivators, who can test themselves against the Silver Daolords
and the Black Emperors here. That way, they can gain a sense for just
how strong the Sithe are. Remember, these are just common
footsoldiers of the Sithe race; they cannot be considered the true
Sithe elites. You absolutely must not be overconfident against the
Sithe; when you fight, you must go all-out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 318 nearby planets
within the astral river next to us each hold a legacy within them
which was left behind by one of the Hegemons who follow me. None of
us know how many of them will survive this war, and it is possible
that all of them will be doomed, representing an end to the cream of
the crop of the cultivator civilizations and an end to a force that
was built up over countless aeons. They have all left their legacies
here in the hopes that our cultivator civilizations shall never fully
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if we cultivators
end up losing this battle, I still believe that our worlds shall give
birth to an endless stream of resistance fighters. One day, the Sithe
shall be eliminated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These are the words of
Bolin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
stunned for quite some time after reading the characters on the stone
stele. They could sense the stately yet determined fighting will
which was inherent within those words; although Autarch Bolin had
been in great pain upon seeing his disciple perish, when he wrote
upon this stone stele he was completely focused on preserving the
cultivator civilizations as a whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, we
ended up winning that war,” Ning murmured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. For Autarch
Bolin to leave behind so many precautions… I really can’t imagine
just how powerful the Sithe once were,” Ninedust sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Autarch said
that we can spar against these ‘Silver Daolords’ and these ‘Black
Emperors’,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are they capable of
fighting?” Ninedust glanced at the distant tower. “I’ll give it
a try first.” As he spoke, he immediately flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Ninedust moved
closer towards the flying tower, one of the Black Emperors standing
atop the tower suddenly glanced downwards and said coldly, “Go and
kill that enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Emperor!”
Instantly, one of the Silver Daolords on the bottommost levels of the
tower immediately acknowledged the order. His aura of power quickly
expanded and grew in might as he flew towards the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
watched from afar. He wasn’t too worried; Ninedust was much better
than him at staying alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Silver
Daolord charged straight towards Ninedust with a longspear in its
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see just
how strong a ‘real’ Sithe Silver Daolord is!” Ninedust was
eager to do battle, and he sent his longstaff towards the oncoming
attack, causing a seemingly endless series of ripples to appear
around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The tip of the
spear clashed head-on against the longstaff. Ninedust immediately
could feel his longstaff tremble to the point where he nearly lost
control of it. As for the longspear, it continued its downwards stab
towards him. Slash - it stabbed Ninedust on his chest! Ninedust’s
eyes widened in disbelief. With a whoosh, he transformed into a vast
wave that quickly retreated backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to run?”
The Silver Daolord pressed the attack, his longspear striking at more
than a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust immediately
transformed into water once more as he continued his hurried retreat.
Slash! Slash! Slash! The Silver Daolord launched one attack after
another, the tip of his longspear gleaming with incomparably sharp
light. Ninedust let out a miserable cry, “I can feel the pain even
through my invulnerable aquaform! This is terrifying.” While
howling, he continued to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Need my help?”
Ning shouted to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet, not yet!”
Ninedust immediately replied. However, after Ninedust fled a certain
distance away the Silver Daolord suddenly came to a halt. The Silver
Daolord glanced coldly at Ninedust, then flew back to the tower and
returned to its original position on the bottom level. Its aura of
incredible power quickly dissipated as it seemed to go back to
normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust fled over next
to Ning, transforming back into human form. “Whew.” Ninedust let
out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were beaten in
just one clash?” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were definitely
much more powerful than the three clan leaders,” Ninedust said
quickly. “That Silver Daolord had extremely formidable spear-arts;
I imagine he was on par with me! Given that he had also undergone the
Ritual Sacrificium to become a Silver Daolord, he naturally is much
stronger than I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is what true
Silver Daolords are like. Those three clan leaders were at far too
low a level of insight.” Ning nodded. “Those three Black Emperors
are in charge of a total of three hundred Silver Daolords… how
terrifying. These Silver Daolords are all comparable to the eight
Archons, the lords of the Sacred Cities. Three hundred of them
working together… not even a Hegemon would be able to withstand
them.” Three hundred Silver Daolords truly was a terrifyingly
strong force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarch Bolin’s
personal disciple, Hegemon Bazu, was quite strong; even though he was
surrounded, he was able to kill 126 Silver Daolords and a Black
Emperor.” Ninedust sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt admiration
towards Hegemon Bazu as well. During the Dawn War, both of the
Hegemons of the Endless Territories had perished in order to take
down that Black Emperor. Clearly, Hegemon Bazu was much more powerful
than they had been… but alas, he had still died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go try it as
well.” Ning manifested three heads and six arms, then charged
forwards with six Northbow swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying tower
continued to hover there in the void. Once Ning moved closer to it,
one of the Black Emperors at the top of the tower glanced down at
Ning and then ordered, “Go and kill the invader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
spear-wielding Silver Daolord at the very bottom of the tower
acknowledged: “Yes, Emperor.” As it spoke, it flew towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These aren’t
actual living beings; they are nothing more than simulacra.” Ning
could tell that they weren’t alive, but he still couldn’t help
but feel admiration for the Autarch; to be able to create simulacra
of three Black Emperors and three hundred Silver Daolords was
absolutely incredible. Autarchs truly were unfathomably strong! It
was thanks to the leadership of the Autarchs and countless
cultivators sacrificing themselves that they had been able to
eliminate the Sithe in the end, albeit at enormous cost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah!” The Silver
Daolord swept out with his longspear, spinning it in a circular arc
as he swept it towards Ning in an indomitable fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Ning moved to
dodge while gently striking out with his sword using the Omega Sword
Dao - Soleheart to affect the Silver Daolord’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Silver
Daolord’s was on par with Ninedust’s staff-arts, Ning was still
slightly superior to him. However, the difference wasn’t that
great, and the Silver Daolord’s other advantages more than
compensated for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Boom! The two continued to fight, causing shockwaves to blast out in
every direction which caused the void to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Silver
Daolord were evenly matched in the fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” One of the
Black Emperors at the top of the tower frowned. “Even after this
much time has passed, he still has yet to be captured? Another one of
you, go and kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Emperor!”
Instantly, a Silver Daolord wielding a pair of hatchets charged out
as well, forcing Ning to slowly begin to withdraw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about fleeing!” the spear-wielding Daolord and the hatchet-wielding
Daolord shouted in unison. The two had surrounded Ning and were
attacking him from a pincer position. Ning immediately was at a
disadvantage, but thanks to his defensive prowess and his six
Northbow swords he was able to hold on. While defending, he continued
to retreat at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Another one,
go.” The Black Emperor at the top of the tower issued the order yet
again, causing a third Silver Daolord to charge forwards. This one
bore a giant warblade on its back. However, before it managed to
arrive Ning had already moved beyond the critical distance, at which
point all of the Silver Daolords withdrew as well. This was something
which Autarch Bolin had implemented; he had done all this to help
temper and train these juniors, not kill them after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a tough
challenge. If one doesn’t do the job, send two. If two can’t hack
it, send three…” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re ever able
to force all three hundred Silver Daolords and all three Black
Emperors to attack in unison… now that would be truly something,”
Ninedust said eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, that’ll have
to wait for after you complete your Daomerge,” Ning said. “Oh,
right. Autarch Bolin said that the 318 planets nearest to us all have
legacies left behind by the various Hegemons. Let’s go take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
was curious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! The two
quickly flew towards the planet located closest to the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This planet wasn’t
all that large, just ten thousand kilometers in circumference. As
soon as they landed atop the planet, they immediately sensed a ripple
of power transmit into their minds. They could vaguely ‘see’ the
mental image of a four-legged beast towering before them, its voice
booming within their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Hegemon
Thousand Rhinos, a retainer of Autarch Bolin! The war against the
Sithe has already begun, and all of us Hegemons are following Autarch
Bolin into battle against the Sithe. No one knows what the end result
will be, and so I have left all of my insights and supreme techniques
behind in this place. The cultivator civilizations shall not perish!
The Sithe shall one day be exterminated!”

Chapter 3 - A Heavy Feeling
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt rather
moved and inspired. He could sense how Hegemon Thousand Rhinos had
been completely determined to battle the Sithe to the death, and
could also sense how much hope the Hegemon had placed towards the
cultivator civilizations as a whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if this
senior was able to survive the Dawn War or not.” Ning knew just how
brutal the Dawn War had been, because all of the Hegemons of the
Endless Territories during that era had perished in the Dawn War. “No
matter what… in the end, our side won. The sacrifices of all those
slain cultivators were not in vain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A wave of power
shot out as a large amount of information flooded into Ning’s mind.
This was the legacy of Hegemon Thousand Rhinos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trained in the
Omega Sword Dao and had received guidance from the Autarch’s Daos;
by now, he had a far broader vision than many. These Hegemon-level
legacies were of use to him in comparing to his own Dao, but the
secret arts were of more help to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some time later, Ning
and Ninedust woke up from their reverie atop the small planet. They
exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
Ninedust’s voice was rather hoarse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, quite
incredible.” Ning nodded. “For the sake of ensuring that the
cultivator civilizations will continue, he held nothing back at all.
He didn’t even require us to swear any lifeblood oaths when
learning these legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninedust
nodded. It was true; neither had been forced to swear lifeblood
oaths! It must be understood that the more valuable a legacy was, the
more likely it was that the successor would have to swear a lifeblood
oath in order to learn it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Hegemon in
the alternate universe, the Paragon of Pills, the Brightshore
Hegemon… they had all required lifeblood oaths that their teachings
would not be taught to outsiders. Even fairly ordinary sects like
Vastheaven Palace required these oaths. Ning had been forced to pay a
significant price just to transmit those fairly ordinary techniques
and divine abilities of Vastheaven Palace back to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But… Thousand Rhinos
had been an exalted Hegemon! And yet, he had unstintingly passed down
all of the legacies he had developed over the course of countless
aeons to Ning and Ninedust without even requiring them to swear
lifeblood oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to that
other planet,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ninedust nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! The two
flew next to each other like streaks of light as they moved to the
planet closest to them. This planet was also fairly small, just ten
thousand kilometers in size. When their feet landed atop the planet,
they once more sensed that ripple of power be transmitted into their
minds. This time, Ning felt as though he could see a snowy-winged man
who emanated a halo of white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am God Emperor
Helong, a retainer of Autarch Bolin and a master of an otherverse. I
established my own church, and over the course of countless years I
spread my organization across three entire realmverses. I had thought
that I would be able to continue my campaign of conquest… but the
appearance of the Sithe brought me back to my senses. Only then did I
understand that to the Sithe, I was nothing more than an easily
crushed ant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe seek to
enslave all cultivators. Those like us who refuse to submit are all
subject to death. Although I have been alive for countless years and
have conquered for countless years, when I think of how all
cultivator civilizations might one day be enslaved by the Sithe, I
have only one thought in my mind… to exterminate them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, God Emperor
Helong, shall do everything in my power to slay all Sithe. Future
cultivators, if we fail in our task, you must take it up in our
stead. Kill, kill, kill! You must exterminate every single Sithe!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lofty, noble voice
of the snowy-winged man was filled with murderous malice that was so
strong it shook even Ning’s Dao-heart. Moments later, a large
amount of information began to flood into his mind. This was all the
legacies which God Emperor Helong had to offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later, Ning
and Ninedust opened their eyes and exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
Ninedust was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought that the
[Heartsword] art was quite unique, but who would’ve thought that
God Emperor Helong would’ve come up with a similar technique, the
[God Emperor’s Apocalypse] art?” Ning nodded. This was another
technique that allowed for the perfect fusion of heartforce with
divine power; thanks to this technique, God Emperor Helong had
reached a level of power that surpassed that of ordinary Hegemons!
This was what gave him the strength needed to take control of an
otherverse and then spread his organization across three separate
realmverses. His church had a total of eight Hegemons within it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if this
mighty figure was able to survive,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how strong he
was? It is entirely possible that he did.” Still, Ning didn’t
feel confident in this guess. The information they had learned
regarding the Sithe from the Emperor-class golems they had bound had
completely shocked them… and that was probably just the tip of the
iceberg!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Helong had
been very strong, yes. But compared to the Sithe? Just as the God
Emperor had said; he was nothing more than an ant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They visited one planet
after another, flying from legacy to legacy and collecting them all.
This vast astral river contained trillions of planets and stars, but
only the 318 planets closest to the flying vessel had legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grand total of 318
Hegemonic legacies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They listened to the
exhortations these Hegemons had left behind for posterity. They could
sense the boundless wisdom and indescribable hard work which
permeated each and every legacy… and in every case, neither Ning
nor Ninedust were forced to swear lifeblood oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a long sigh. He felt as though he was releasing a pent-up sense
of pressure which had been weighing on his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of them
required lifeblood oaths. In other words, we are allowed to transmit
all 318 Hegemonic legacies as we please.” Ninedust sighed in
amazement. “We’re actually given free reign.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was excited as
well. So many techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts… and
they were allowed to transmit them as they pleased! His homeland, the
Three Realms, would now have a true foundation for it to grow to
incredible heights!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These seniors
probably WANTED us to transmit them,” Ning said. “If the
cultivator civilizations were truly defeated in that great war, there
would naturally be a need to produce more cultivators of great power.
For the sake of this war, they had already cast off even their fear
of death; they naturally wouldn’t mind others transmitting their
legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in the end, our
side won the war.” Ninedust sighed with emotion. “Thus, every
single modern-day organization is extremely protective of its
precious legacies and absolutely refuse to transmit them casually to
others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, the
cultivator civilizations were facing a total war against the Sithe.
The Sithe have been destroyed long ago, and so the cultivator
civilizations naturally turned against each other instead.” Ning
shook his head. An outside threat would prompt internal unity, but
once the threat was dealt with? The internal strife would appear once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a place as small
as the Three Realms had fierce civil wars. Hell, even tiny clans had
internal strife, to say nothing of a place as vast as the Endless
Territories! The various realmverses most likely battled against each
other as well. For example, the Dark Kingdom consisted of refugees
who had fled from another realmverse. As a result, they were
ostracized and oppressed by the locals of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,”
Ninedust said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We absolutely cannot
just hand out these legacies willy-nilly,” Ninedust said. “Once a
major power realizes what we have, we’ll be in serious trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Every single
organization’s foundation rests upon its powerful experts and its
precious legacies.” Ning nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After we leave, I’m
planning to take a trip back home,” Ninedust said seriously. “I’m
going to write down and transcribe all of the legacies we’ve
acquired. I’ll let my avatar hold onto them, and I won’t make
them public. Only if I die or after I complete my Daomerge attempt
will I transmit these things to the rest of the Ancients.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust let out a
sigh. “These legacies will have an absolutely enormous impact. If I
make them public too soon, it’ll probably have certain
repercussions for me. After I complete my Daomerge, I’ll have
nothing else to worry about… and if I die, I also won’t have
anything to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be in a
hurry to transmit them either.” Ning nodded. “My homeland is
still far too weak.” In the end, he was going to give these
legacies to the Three Realms, but it couldn’t be rushed. Ning was
preparing to first slowly introduce to the Three Realms the more
shallow techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts that were
suitable for Daolords of the First Step! As for the more profound
ones? He would take it slow. If he died, then he would naturally
arrange for the full transmission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Legacies from over
three hundred Hegemons… this brought an enormous sense of pressure
to both Ning and Ninedust. Neither dared to transmit them casually.
In the end, they were still too weak; only if they reached Hegemony
themselves would they have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a planet. Ning and
Ninedust were in secluded meditation within a temporal thatched
cottage and a temporal log cabin. Both needed time to properly
‘digest’ these legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering
battle-intent which the Hegemons had infused into their messages was
actually a form of tempering for them as well, causing both of their
Dao-hearts to change slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With these things,
my chances of succeeding in the Daomerge have increased once again.”
Ninedust walked out of the temporal log cabin, a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Voidsea Jadeseal, an
Autarch’s Dao-guidance, and over three hundred Hegemonic legacies.
Ninedust was starting to feel more and more confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Darknorth is
still meditating? He’s quite a bit slower than me.” Ninedust
chuckled, then turned to glance at the flying tower. “Time to test
out those Silver Daolords again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ninedust soared
into the skies. Although he was still far weaker than a Silver
Daolord, he would at least be able to keep himself safe. This was a
good opportunity for him to temper himself.

Chapter 4 - The Strange Planet
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning needed much
more time to ‘digest’ these legacies than Ninedust, because
Ninedust had already reached the Verge as a Daolord. All he needed to
do was to perfect his Dao and accumulate more experience so as to
improve his odds of succeeding at the Daomerge. Ning, however, was
different. He was just a Daolord of the Third Step, which meant he
needed many more insights. He naturally had to carefully immerse
himself in these Hegemonic legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We really have
gained tremendously from this visit.” Ning emerged from his
temporal cottage, then stared at the flying tower off in the
distance. “Legacies from over three hundred Hegemons… this will
be of enormous help to both me and the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine abilities
were useless to Ning, but the secrets arts were extremely useful.
Although he did have a secret art bestowed by that dead Sword Hegemon
from the otherverse, these three hundred-plus Hegemons bestowed far
more. In fact, there were four who were focused on the Dao of the
Sword! Ning ended up choosing a secret art that suited him the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I become a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, I’ll simultaneously train in both of
these secret arts! Once I use the two of them via my Yin-Yang Sword
Domain, they’ll mutually reinforce and support each other…”
Ning was quite eager to see what would happen. There was a certain
finesse to choosing secret arts, and the more powerful a secret art
was the more requirements it had with regards to the level of the
wielder’s insights into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine novessence
arts, for example, needed one to be able to perfectly master and
merge together nine types of Dao lightning. Ninedust’s Ripplewater
art required incredible insight into the Dao of Water. The Sword
Hegemon’s secret art and this new secret art which Ning had chosen
were both focused on the Dao of the Sword. Both required the wielder
to know a great deal regarding that Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust,” Ning
called out loudly. His voice traversed the flows of space and passed
into the ears of the distant Ninedust, who was battling more than a
hundred million kilometers off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ninedust
hurriedly retreated, pulling away from the Silver Daolord as he
glanced backwards. “Darknorth, you finally came out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the way
you just fought, you’ve perfected your ultimate attacks even
further. That supremely aggressive staff-stance, you executed with
water-like fluidity. This shows that your mastery of the Dao of Water
has improved.” Ning flew over like a streak of light, quickly
arriving next to Ninedust as he spoke in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty-five out of
those hundreds of Hegemons were skilled in the Dao of Water, allowing
me to benefit greatly from their insights. I feel as though my
chances at the Daomerge are growing better and better,” Ninedust
said smugly. “I feel as though I have a ten percent chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten percent. It sounded
puny, but Daolords normally had less than a hundredth of a percent at
completing the Daomerge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations!”
Ning revealed a delighted look. He truly did feel happy for Ninedust.
As for himself, although he had gained the Autarch’s Dao-guidance
and also reviewed the many legacies of the Hegemons, his path was
still that of the Omega Sword Dao; it was a path that was untold
times more difficult than the one which Ninedust had chosen! There
was a limit to how much benefit these other legacies would be to him.
None of those Hegemons had chosen an Omega Dao, and so his chances at
the Daomerge still remained as infinitesimally small as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he failed his
Daomerge while Ninedust succeeded, he would ask Ninedust to help take
care of the Three Realms. If a Hegemon watched over it, its
inhabitants would have a much easier life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about you? You
must’ve gained even more insights than me,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not quite
there yet, but I feel close to a breakthrough,” Ning said. After
distilling the experiences of over three hundred Hegemons, Ning had
gained quite a few new insights into his Heavenbreaker stance. He
wasn’t too far away from reaching the fourth stage of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s enough
chatting. I’m gonna go spar a bit against those Silver Daolords.”
Ning immediately manifested three heads and six arms, then charged
towards the flying tower with six Northbow swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments later, an
onyx humanoid standing at the top of the flying tower ordered for
three silver Daolords to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dares to come
again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill this Daolord.”
The three Silver Daolords charged towards Ning, with Ning coming to a
halt close to the outer perimeter and engaging them in a battle
there. When he sensed that he wasn’t able to hold on any longer, he
would immediately retreat outside of the perimeter. That way, the
Silver Daolords would withdraw as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
understood what Autarch Bolin’s intentions were. Autarch Bolin had
created this world, then had his hundreds of Hegemon retainers leave
down their legacies, precisely so that he could ensure the future
cultivators would have access to good Immortal techniques, divine
abilities, and secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had even gone so far
as to make simulacra of the Sithe’s Black Emperors and Silver
Daolords… all of this was for the sake of improving the combat
power of the cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly poured his
heart into this,” Ning sighed with emotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!
Darknorth!” After several years of battling, Ninedust suddenly
called out, “We haven’t paid that flying vessel a visit yet.
Shouldn’t we go inside and take a look?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarch Bolin didn’t
say that the vessel held any treasures within it,” Ning said. The
stone stele had only mentioned that one could spar against the
simulated Sithe and acquire legacies from the Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should still go
take a look. Doing nothing but sparring against Silver Daolords is
kind of boring anyhow; by now, I understand every single technique
they use,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. Battling is
rather pointless by now.” Ning agreed with this assessment. When
fighting against three Silver Daolords, he often found himself unable
to hold on and thus was forced to retreat! But this wasn’t due to
him being at a lower level of insight; in fact, he was on a higher
level than all three of them. The problem was that his foes were
incredibly fast and strong, and there was no answer for that. This
made sparring against them of limited use to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s be careful,”
Ning warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be fine.
Autarch Bolin wouldn’t have set up traps for us,” Ninedust said.
Still, he chose to send one of his Emperor-class golems to scout
first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel was
completely empty inside. There were no traps inside, nor were there
any treasures. There was just a line of words left behind on the
inner walls:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only way to
break through from Hegemony and reach Autarchy is to accumulate
sufficient experience. Aside from this, there are no other paths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This line of words was
filled with stately majesty. Clearly, they had been left behind by
Autarch Bolin himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Accumulate
sufficient experience?” Ning and Ninedust stared at the line of
words for a long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not dwell on
it too much. The greatest challenge standing in front of us is the
Daomerge.” Ning smiled. “Let’s worry about this after
succeeding in the Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
nodded. “Oh, right. Darknorth, we’ve spent this entire time in
the area around the flying vessel; we haven’t explored the other
parts of this world. To tell you the truth, there’s a limit to how
much this place is going to be use to us. I’m planning to explore
this area a bit; if there’s nothing else here, I’m going to
leave! But of course, if you want to dally here a bit longer I can
wait on a nearby planet and train there until you are ready to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place isn’t
of much use to me either.” Ning agreed. “Come, let’s walk
around and see what there is to see. After that, we’ll leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This world which the
Autarch had created was extremely large. Ning and Ninedust stood
within the void above it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld,
descend!” With but a thought, Ning send his vast heartworld
projection rumbling downwards. It quickly spread out in every
direction to encompass the entire planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And?” Ninedust
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other parts of
this world are completely empty and devoid of all things.” Ning
pointed off into the distance. “The only exception is over there.
The astral river seems to pass through this entire world, and there’s
something inside it that radiates an aura of incredible power. Not
even my heartworld projection is able to infiltrate it at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? It seems we need
to spend a bit of time looking into this astral river.” Ninedust
was filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Swoosh! Swoosh! The two immediately entered the astral river and
began to fly through it. The flying vessel, the flying tower, and the
318 small planets had been nothing more than a small part of this
vast astral river which permeated the enormous world they were in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are countless
stars here, but they all seem quite ordinary.” Ninedust was rather
disappointed by what he found. By now, they had already been flying
for more than three months and had searched through nearly half the
astral river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, there was an
enormous planet that was slowly revolving in place, emanating an aura
of oppressive majesty. Ning and Ninedust were able to vaguely sense
it even from a great distance, causing their eyes to narrow. It must
be remembered that all of the other planets were tiny, merely ten
thousand kilometers or so in size. The vast planet they could vaguely
see off in the distance, however, had to be at least ten billion
kilometers in diameter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
planet, and what a powerful aura! So the astral river actually has
such a special locale inside of it?” Ning and Ninedust exchanged a
glance, then immediately flew towards it. As they moved closer, they
were able to see it with increasing clarity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This planet was quite
unique. On one side, it had a blazing red sea of flames that emanated
an aura of incredible heat. The flamewaves which roiled that side
were actually filled with the ripples of the Dao itself, with every
single wave containing an amount of force comparable to a
full-strength strike from a Daolord of the Fourth Step. This caused
Ning and Ninedust to feel shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other side of the
planet was an endless stream of deep-blue water that emanated an aura
of infinite cold. This cold similarly radiated Dao-ripples of equal
power to the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an unusual
planet.” Ning was rather surprised. One side was filled with a sea
of flames, the other was filled with an icy sea of water. Both sides
emanated the profound mysteries of the Dao. As for the hemispheric
intersection where the hot and cold energies met and clashed against
each other, an endless dense line of mist appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the mist,
they could vaguely make out the crown of a massive tree, as well as
see a few long, skinny, fiery-red fruits hanging from the top.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from those
leaves… that should be one of the eight types of sacred bloodfruit,
the ‘omnigeddon bloodfruit’. But… these fruits look rather
strange. And, generally speaking, a single omnigeddon bloodfruit tree
should have just three fruits per harvest. I can already see roughly
six of those fruits sprouting from the crown of the tree, and that’s
with the rest of it shrouded by mist.” Ning was puzzled. “Is it
some other type of fruit? Ninedust, can you recognize this fruit
tree?”
</P>

Chapter 5 - Surrounded By Observers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
trunk, the branches, the leaves, and the aura of the fruit…”
Ninedust frowned in puzzlement as well. “Yeah, that should
definitely be an omnigeddon bloodfruit tree.” He was an Ancient
cultivator who had a very high level of status within the race; as a
result, he knew most of the precious materials and ingredients in the
Chaosverse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But something feels
off.” Ji Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, omnigeddon
bloodfruits are round and slick; they don’t look long and skinny
like that. In addition, there’s way too many fruits… and the tree
itself seems to be a bit too large,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. Right. He
hadn’t noticed it earlier, but ordinary omnigeddon bloodfruit trees
were roughly just thirty meters tall. The crown of the mist-shrouded
tree off in the distance, however, had to be over three million
meters tall!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it does
look a bit odd, this tree is definitely a priceless treasure.”
Ninedust’s gaze turned heated with eagerness. “Judging from the
auras of those bloodfruits, they have to be quite extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look,” Ning said. The two didn’t hesitate, immediately flying
carefully into the deep mist. Soon, they descended upon the area just
outside the fog-shrouded region, the place where blazing heat met
scorching cold and produced that mist. Ning and Ninedust were still
able to see several tens of thousands of kilometers into the
fog-shrouded region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Scorching
waves of flaming heat washed over them from one side, while frigid
waves of icy energy swept towards them from the other side. Ning and
Ninedust descended upon the thin, narrow strip of land where the two
elemental seas met and collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, a few more kids
have come to test their luck.” A hoarse, grating voice that sounded
like knives and swords grinding against each other suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both badly startled. They hurriedly turned to look towards the
direction of the voice, only to see the distant fog quickly begin to
dissipate. A streak of deep blue light which was even denser than the
fog came surging out of it, tearing the fog apart. Ning and Ninedust
soon saw a strange deep blue creature that looked like a sea dragon
crawl onto the thin ‘bank’ between the two sides of the world. It
stared straight at Ning and Ninedust with its dark-gold eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This dark blue dragon
seemed to have been completely sculpted out of freezing ice, and it
radiated a cold aura of incredible power. Most likely, even
second-tier Daolords would end up having their truesouls frozen solid
and then shattered, resulting in their deaths, unless they had
particularly powerful life-preserving methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, intriguing.
Two young fellows, come to play. Things are finally getting
interesting.” A deep, rumbling laugh rang out from other side as
well, and Ning and Ninedust both hurriedly turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dense mist split
apart once more, and from the other side of the bank appeared a
muscular, four-hooved equine of fire which began to walk towards Ning
and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deep blue dragon
and the fiery equine looked at Ning and Ninedust with some curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, this
place definitely holds some secrets.” Ninedust grew rather nervous
as he sent mentally, “These two are incredibly strong and pose an
incredible threat. I’m worried that I won’t be a match for them
at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll match them
blow for blow.” Ning remained quite calm. These two strange beasts
brought a sense of pressure to him as well, but he still felt
confident in his abilities to stay alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust suddenly
called out loudly, “Greetings, seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, how nice. A
junior who understands the proper way to behave.” The deep blue
dragon lowered its giant draconic head to peer downwards at Ning and
Ninedust. “After all these chaos cycles, the Aeonians have finally
sent another Daolord over! But… you two don’t look like Aeonians.
Have the Aeonians realized that they are outmatched and elected to
ask outsiders for help?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonians truly
are useless.” The flaming equine said with a snicker, “They have
this world all to themselves, but they haven’t been able to produce
so much as a single truly powerful expert. As far as Emperors go?
They don’t even have a Hegemon! As for Daolords, all of theirs are
mediocre.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the two of you
are Daolords, we’ll follow the same rules as always. If you can
defeat the two of us, we won’t bar your path,” the deep blue sea
dragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only have to
defeat the two of us.” The flaming equine was quite eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
were intrigued by this. They were starting to understand. “Seniors,”
Ning said, “Do we have to defeat you individually, or shall we
fight in a group?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two kids can
come against us, one at a time.” The sea dragon let out a chuckle.
“Fight me first, then against the fiery guy over there. If you can
defeat the two of us separately, you’ll be allowed to do as you
please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWOOO! Stop
sleeping! All of you, get over here!” The flaming equine lifted its
head up and let out a mighty howl which echoed throughout every inch
of this planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The entire
vast planet suddenly began to tremble and rumble as the two great
seas on both sides began to shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One deep blue sea
dragon after another began to fly out of the deep blue seas, while
more and more flaming equines flew out of the sea of flames. They
differed in size and strength, with the large ones having auras that
were even more terrifying than the two in front of Ning. The smaller
ones were a bit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly a hundred of the
sea dragons and the flaming equines ended up appearing. They all
looked over to this area, watching rather excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is utterly
terrifying.” Ninedust was badly frightened by this. He immediately
sent to Ning, “There were actually this many creatures hidden
within this planet? If they were all to attack in unison… I’m
afraid that only Hegemons would be able to survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning sensed
the terrifying danger the two groups posed. These beasts were simply
too strong; neither he nor Ninedust could possibly resist them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be surrounded and
watched by so many of those beasts… Ning and Ninedust both felt a
sense of great pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are members of
our race,” the deep blue sea dragon in front of Ning said. “Don’t
worry. Since you two are merely Daolords, they will only stand off to
one side and watch. If an Emperor came, they would have to defeat
both of our races in order to proceed! As mere Daolords, beating the
two of us will suffice. Otherwise, you can forget about leaving with
any of the treasures on this planet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which of you two
will be the first to attack?” The flaming equine was starting to
grow impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
felt rather stunned. Ninedust sent mentally, “The Aeonians do not
have any Hegemons. It seems as though they are not able to defeat
these two races, and I can’t even imagine how long it would take
before they are able to give birth to a Daolord capable of defeating
these two beasts without assistance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I’ll go first
and see just how tough these beasts are,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be up to
you. I have no shot at all,” Ninedust said helplessly. His
subconscious was screaming danger at him, ensuring that he understood
that he was no match whatsoever for these two beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two massive beasts
standing at each end of the thin strip of land squinted at the tiny
little dot in front of them. Far away, within the two vast seas, the
two races of nearly two hundred terrifying beasts all watched with
interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go first,”
Ning said aloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The deep
blue sea dragon grinned widely. “Come forward, young fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
manifested three heads and six arms, bringing his six Northbow swords
to the ready. Swoosh! Ning instantly charged into the skies, moving
far faster than a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heeey. Pretty fast!”
The sea dragon’s eyes lit up. It instantly and excitedly waved its
right paw, sending it striking towards Ning at more than a hundred
times the speed of light. This claw-strike emanated a bone-chilling
cold that pierced towards Ning’s tiny little frame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved in an almost
ghostly manner. He merely had to gently rap the flat of his blade
against the right claw to force it aside, then charged straight
towards the sea dragon’s flank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord isn’t
bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s pretty
tough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonian Daolords
themselves are far too weak. I wonder where they managed to find such
a formidable young fellow to help them out?” The two races of
beasts watched from the distant seas with interest, commenting as the
battle proceed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
stabbed straight towards the sea dragon’s flank, his Northbow sword
immediately executing his Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop. A mist-formed
sword tore through the skies, stabbing straight at the deep blue
flank. The sea dragon didn’t just look as though it had been
sculpted out of an enormous piece of ice, it actually WAS covered by
layers of thick, dense ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The tip of the
sword stabbed into the ice, just barely managing to leave behind a
tiny little wound on the outermost layer of the ice. Moments later,
cold energy flowed forwards and quickly restored the damage down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. The deep blue
sea dragon’s vast body suddenly flew backwards, coiling like a whip
then snapping forward through the skies as it caused a vast illusory
wave to appear in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was simply too fast
and too massive. There was no chance for Ning to dodge at all. He
immediately used his six Northbow swords to defend as the sea dragon
slammed its massive bulk straight against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! It was like using
a giant whip to swat a tiny mosquito. Ning felt an enormous amount of
power spread throughout his entire body, sending him flying backwards
uncontrollably. He smashed into the distant ground, creating a giant
crevice that was more than a thousand kilometers long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? He didn’t die,
did he?” The deep blue sea dragon hovered there in the skies,
peering downwards with concern. Only when he could sense that Ning
was still unharmed did he relax slightly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - Understood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had already
flown out of the long crevice and landed next to it. Naturally, he
was completely unharmed; after spending hundreds of millions of years
within the Sithe ruine inside the Stone Hellephant Wall, he had long
ago trained his body to make it comparable to high-grade Eternal
weapons. On top of that, he also had his Hegemon armor! Even if he
didn’t use sword-arts to block, he’d still be able to take this
hit. When you factored in how powerful his defensive sword-arts were…
the only reason he had even been sent flying was because the sea
dragon had snapped its body like a whip, generating such enormous
momentum that he couldn’t help but fly backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
raised his head to stare seriously at the deep blue sea dragon in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m glad you
didn’t die. I was afraid I would’ve beaten you to death with a
single whap. That would’ve been boring.” The sea dragon coiling
in the air peered downwards at Ning, its voice booming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, can you
beat it?” Ninedust asked mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a solemn look
on his face. “It’ll be a bit difficult. It’s not so bad when it
stays still, but when it starts to move its entire body strikes like
a supple, long whip. Its movements are extremely unpredictable, and I
wasn’t able to dodge in time. That’s why I was knocked flying.”
He had reached the fourth stage of his Shadowless stance long ago,
and his movements were extremely unpredictable… but he had still
been knocked flying by the sea dragon. Ning understood that this
meant the sea dragon’s movements were every bit as ghostly and
unpredictable as his own!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grow!” Ning roared
loudly. Whoosh! Ning’s divine body began to dramatically grow in
size, towering to become a titanic mountain-sized giant with three
heads and six arms. Each of the six Northbow swords in his hands
transformed to become utterly massive as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, he grew bigger?”
The sea dragon watched curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re too close to
each other at my normal size; I don’t have enough time to dodge.”
Ning’s voice boomed out, “My only choice is to grow bigger and
stay a good distance away from you; that way, I might be able to
avoid some attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The farther away they
were from each other, the more space Ning would have to maneuver in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know, young
fellow, I’m most confident in my agility and in my
unpredictability. Come, let’s dance again.” The sea dragon
suddenly charged downwards. Whoosh! Its sinuous body lashed out like
a whip, leaving behind an arc in the skies as it charged straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly moved
backwards while using one of his mist-formed swords in a ghostly
block. Clank! The sword-light clashed against the sea dragon’s
claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The sea
dragon’s tail came lashing towards Ning with shadowy speed! Space
itself seemed to be torn apart by this strike, which was so fast as
to render Ning speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Ning hurriedly retreated while executing his Omega Sword Dao -
Soleheart. Fortunately, he himself was also quite unpredictably agile
and he also moved more than a hundred times faster than the speed of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea dragon let out
a mighty roar as it coiled around itself. Is tail swept outwards as
its upper body dove downwards, sending its fierce draconic claws
straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
Fortunately, Ning had three heads and six arms, allowing him to just
barely block this draconic strike. However, the sea dragon suddenly
opened its massive draconic maws and then bit down towards Ning! Ning
hurriedly retreated backwards to avoid this terrifying bite. Boom!
The sea dragon charged headfirst-towards Ning, delivering a headbutt
against the fleeing Ning and sending him flying even further
backwards. He only came to a halt after flying a great distance, at
which point Ning flew back to the field of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too fast and too
slippery.” Ning’s head was starting to hurt. The sea dragon’s
entire body was covered with extremely thick layers of frozen ice,
which meant that there were no weaknesses to exploit at all. Every
single part of its body could be used as a weapon! It was also
incredibly fast and slippery, capable of unleashing consecutive
combination attacks without pause.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve always relied
on my speed and unpredictable attacks to achieve victory, but this
sea dragon just so happens to be superior to me in these areas…”
Ning frowned. “It seems my only choice is to break through using
raw power. I suppose I’ll give it a try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Break through with
overwhelming, raw power in a frontal strike! It didn’t matter how
unpredictable the enemy’s attacks were if you could just barrel
straight forwards with an unstoppable strike; so long as the attack
landed, the enemy would be defeated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
yet to use his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker was because of what
had happened during his first clash against the deep blue sea dragon.
His Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop had only been able to drill a tiny
wound into the thick layers of ice covering the sea dragon’s body.
Ning had gotten a vague sense of how terrifyingly tough that armor of
ice was, and thus he didn’t feel confident in his Omega Sword Dao -
Heavenbreaker and its chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he was out of
options. He had to give it a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid is pretty
fast, and his sword-arts are also quite ghostly. Although he’s at a
disadvantage, at least he’s able to put up a good fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare
for us to encounter such a formidable Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting,
interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
his protective divine ability is also quite formidable. He has yet to
take any injuries at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearly two hundred
beasts who were watching in the two vast seas were all quite
interested in this battle, and they chatted while watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s been
shut down.” Ninedust was starting to grow anxious. “We actually
ran into something that has even weirder attacks than him and which
is just as fast as him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!” Ning
bellowed. This time, his demeanor was completely different. He put
away his other five Northbow swords, leaving just one sword behind.
All six of his arms tightly clenched the sole remaining sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Ning began to run across the ground. His speed wans’t
that fast, less than a hundred times the speed of light, but as he
ran his aura seemed to grow increasingly powerful. The most important
aspect to the Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker lay in the accumulation
of power! Only after accumulating enough power could you then unleash
it in a terrifying blow; only then could Ning unleash his true, most
powerful strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The airborne
sea dragon was slightly startled upon seeing this, then grew excited:
“His aura seems to have become quite savage! But I’ll have to
test it out myself to see just how strong he is. I hope he doesn’t
disappoint.” The sea dragon let out an excited roar, then swooped
downwards and charged straight towards Ning. It didn’t move to
dodge, nor did it feel the need to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to bound
forwards, his momentum and aura having reached an apex. Riiiiiip! The
sea dragon struck out with a pair of draconic claws, tearing
downwards through the sky at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now… BREAK for
me!” Ning roared loudly. All six of his hands were clenched tightly
around his sword as he raised it up high, pouring more and more
energy into it. It had already transformed into a thick, blurry
pillar of mist-formed sword energy of incredible weight and density.
Ning then delivered a furious downwards chop, causing the thick
pillar of mist to suddenly explode! It was like the bursting of a
volcano, with all of his power and might exploding forth from the
strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stately thick
pillar of mist-formed sword energy seemed to have suddenly exploded
and transformed into a dazzling star that had gone supernova. All of
its power was unleashed in an instant as it smashed directly against
the draconic claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOOM! A terrifying
shockwave of force blasted out, causing Ning to be knocked backwards.
This time, he was sent flying even faster than before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea dragon had
previously been quite excited, but the terrifying collision caused
even its body to tremble. The mighty shockwave swept across its
entire body, flipping it upside down and sending it flying backwards
as well. Moments later, a series of cracking sounds could be heard as
the ice over its body began to splinter and crack, making it look
almost like a turtle shell. Some of the shattered pieces of ice
actually began to fall off of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the creature
quickly righted itself and brought itself to a halt in the skies. Its
body had previously glistened beautifully, but it was now covered
with countless ugly cracks and scars that spanned its entire body.
However, a dense aura of cold energy quickly spread out to cover its
body, causing the cracks and tears to quickly heal. In less time than
was needed to take a single breath, the many ugly wounds had been
completely healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It healed that
fast?” The spectating Ninedust was speechless. “This is going to
be trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, again!” Ning
had been blown backwards, but he charged straight forwards with an
indomitable aura, roaring with high-spirited laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still held just a
single sword in his six arms, and like Pangu cleaving apart Heaven
from Earth he once more delivered a furious frontal chop with endless
might!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent,
excellent! It’s been so long since I’ve had this much fun.” The
deep blue sea dragon charged forwards as well. This time, it lashed
out with its massive tail in a swatting blow at Ning, smashing it
straight against Ning’s sword. BOOM! The two were once more sent
flying backwards. This time, the sea dragon was prepared and thus it
suffered slightly fewer wounds and cracks to its body. The ones that
did appear once more healed quite quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
the desire to do battle. He charged forwards repeatedly, using raw,
overwhelming force to clash straight against the deep blue sea
dragon. The sea dragon started off quite excited by this fight, but
it quickly grew resigned and bored… it didn’t want to fight
head-on against Ning, but it simply had no way to avoid Ning’s
straightforward and dominating Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker. Ning
was far less agile than it was, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see just
how long your divine power and Immortal energy will be able to hold
on for!” The deep blue sea dragon started to grow angry, and it
rammed straight against Ning time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
two clashed repeatedly, causing the two groups of beasts watching
from the two seas to become rather puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
with that Daolord? He knows there’s no way to win like this, so why
is he doing this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does seem rather
odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t be able
to win like this. He won’t be able to win unless he can smash open
the frozen ice with a single blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was no fool, of
course. However, when he had first used his Omega Sword Dao -
Heavenbreaker to clash head-on against the deep blue sea dragon, the
furious yet exhilarating feelings had caused him to gain a spark of
insight! He began to gain more and more insights, which was why he
continued to furiously unleash his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker
against the sea dragon, hoping to be able to finally catapault his
Heavenbreaker stance to the fourth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! With the
ninety-eighth collision, Ning’s face lit up with excitement as he
flew backwards. “I understand now! I finally understand!”
</P>

Chapter 7 - Autarh’s Decree
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning finally saw the
light, and his Heavenbreaker stance broke through to the fourth
stance. Now… his Blood Drop stance, Shadowless stance,
Heavenbreaker stance, Yin-Yang stance, and Soleheart stance had all
broken through to the fourth stage. These five stances were linked
together and reinforced each other, giving Ning a sense of perfection
and completeness. However… he knew that this sense of perfection
wasn’t the true apex! Only when he perfectly fused these five
stances into his Omega Sword Dao - Stage Four would they undergo a
qualitative breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just one step
away… once I take that step, I’ll be a Daolord of the Fourth
Step! When that happens, my only consideration shall be whether or
not I should engage in the Daomerge.” Ning was filled with
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge? He felt
as though his chances were slim; he didn’t dare put too much hope
into that! But once he became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, he’d
become dramatically more powerful. As his understanding of the
[Heartsword] art slowly improved, he’d probably surpass the level
of the Archons of the Sacred Cities and close in on the Hegemon
level! Emperor Heartsword had been inferior to Ning in his mastery of
the Dao of the Sword, but thanks to his full mastery of all fifteen
stances of the [Heartsword] art he had been extremely close to the
Hegemon level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a much greater
grasp of the Dao of the Sword, and he had also reached an extremely
high level in the [Heartsword] art; it was entirely possible for him
to one day become equal to Hegemons in power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that level of
power, he would be able to go off adventuring… and perhaps he might
be able to find something that he could use to convince an Autarch to
reverse the flows of spacetime and revive Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I take that
final step and become a Daolord of the Fourth Step, I’ll go and
challenge the Azureflower Estate once more! The destiny which awaits
me there is definitely an extraordinary one.” Ning eagerly
anticipated the coming of that day… but everything had to wait for
him to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step first! Although he had
already reached the fourth stage in all five of his stances, he had
to merge them together into his final Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How long would this
step take? It could be as fast as the next instant… but could also
be as slow as a chaos cycle or even a hundred chaos cycles!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The airborne
sea dragon peered downwards at the white-robed youth, realizing that
the youth had come to a halt. It let out a rumbling shout, “Kid,
you tired from all the fighting? You were fighting me head-on like
crazy. I imagine you must’ve used up a great deal of your divine
power and Immortal energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ning smiled
slightly. “Let’s do it again. If you can still withstand my
strike, I’ll stop the fight.” His voice echoed throughout the
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth… did
he…?” The distant Ninedust was truly shocked as he watched this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this young
fellow suddenly saying something so bold?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did he come up with
a way to gain victory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see just
what he’s planning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two races of beasts
in the two seas watched curiously from afar. They wanted to see just
what technique Daolord Darknorth would use in this final clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning suddenly
moved with incomparable savagery, transforming into a streak of light
that shot straight towards the distant deep blue sea dragon. The
three-headed, six-armed Ning once more wrapped all six hands around
the hilt of the Northbow sword, filling it with an aura of
overwhelming might as he transformed it into a dominating mist-formed
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique
again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t that what he
used previously?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was puzzled.
Even the sea dragon fighting against Ning was confused, but it didn’t
hesitate; it let out an enraged howl and charged forwards. Ning’s
own agility and sword-arts made it hard for it to dodge, and so it
chose to meet the attack head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! As the sea
dragon charged towards Ning, it suddenly swept out with its tail,
using it to lash out at Ning like an enormous long whip. Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly let out
an earth-shaking howl! The ethereal, mist-formed sword in his hand
suddenly exploded with power, instantly becoming millions of times
brighter as it exploded against the sea dragon’s tail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the sea
dragon collided against Ning’s sword, it immediately knew that
something was wrong! The power of the Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker
was only evident in the very last instant, when it released its
stored power. A slumbering volcano was very ordinary and
unremarkable; one could only understand how truly terrifying it was
in the moment of its explosion. The sea dragon could sense a
terrifying surge of power instantly spread out to cover his entire
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Its entire icy
carapace was only able to withstand the force for a brief instant. A
heartbeat later, the entire carapace shattered apart. No… more than
just the icy carapace, the body inside cracked apart as well! The
entire deep blue sea dragon shattered apart like a piece of ice,
instantly breaking apart into countless little pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
stumbled just thirty meters backwards. He stared intently at the
shattered bits of eyes, watching as a stream of energy flew out from
the freezing ice region and gathered into a blurry figure which
looked much like that of the sea dragon. The illusory sea dragon
looked at Ning, then let out a laugh: “My frozen form was built up
over the course of countless years, but you broke it apart just like
that? Impressive, impressive. You’ve won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. He watched as the illusory sea dragon continued to draw upon
the icy energy of the area, slowly rebuilding its body. However, the
full recovery process would take at least ten thousand years. The
creature continued, “Still… even though that stance of yours was
useful against me, it’ll be useless against the fiery fellow over
there. My forte lay in agility and unpredictability, but the fiery
fellow’s skills lie in overwhelmingly fierce attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
creature retreated into the deep blue seas, flying into it and then
hovering above its surface. A large amount of watery energy swirled
around its body, which it constantly drew upon and absorbed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sword-strike
was quite ferocious. He smashed the frozen form apart.” The
hundreds of spectator beasts were all quite surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was extremely
excited. He flew straight towards Ning: “Darknorth, Darknorth, you
won! Haha! These two beasts should be two matching pairs; one
emanates an aura of endless cold, the other is formed from endless
flames. They should be on par with each other in power! Since you
were able to beat one, you should be able to beat the second one as
well. I can already see your victory!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t get
careless.” Ning stared at the distant flaming equine, then said in
a low voice, “They might be on par with each other, but one might
be much easier to defeat than the other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, defeating
Ning would be extremely difficult. Anyone skilled in defense or who
had extremely formidable protective divine abilities would all be
quite difficult to defeat. Given that the sea dragon came first and
the flaming equine was the second challenge, it seemed likely that in
some way, shape, or form, the flaming equine would be even tougher to
deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can defeat
me, then our two races will no longer move to bar your path.” The
flaming equine’s voice was deep and dominating. “But I’m not as
easy to deal with as the frozen fellow; although those beasts have
extremely hard bodies that can be used as weapons, their bodies are
too easily shattered. Excessive hardness can result in brittleness.
To create bodies formed from frozen ice was a fool’s choice to
begin with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, you fire beasts
are the true fools.” Instantly, one of the many spectating sea
dragons in the air bellowed in disagreement: “Every part of our
frozen bodiescan be used as weapons. We only sent out one of the most
common members of our race to spar against that young fellow. If our
clan leader entered the fray, his sword wouldn’t be able to leave
as much as a mark behind on our leader’s body!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defeat is defeat.”
The flaming equine glanced sideways at the sea dragon, not even
wanting to bother with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, you guys are the
idiots.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wanna start a
fight? You wanna fight again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bitch, let’s go!”
The two races quickly began to squabble against each other. Both
sides were boiling with the eagerness to do battle, a sight which
stupefied both Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning and Ninedust
didn’t understand was that this planet had no other living beings,
and so the two races which lived on it had nothing better than to do
when bored than to battle against each other! They’d fight until
the skies themselves turned dark and the world itself turned old. To
them, fighting against each other was as normal as eating or
drinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not be too
hasty.” An ancient voice rang out from one of the deep blue sea
dragons in the skies. This sea dragon looked quite ordinary, but its
aura was so reserved and stately that Ning hadn’t even noticed it
earlier. The sea dragon continued, “The Autarch’s decree was that
we were to live here and prevent cultivators from entering that
place! If you want to fight, you can fight later; we have business to
finish first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. We have
business to finish first.” A similar order came from a stately
flaming equine on the other side of the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two races quickly
calmed down and fell silent. As for Ning and Ninedust, they were
intrigued; the ‘Autarch’s decree’? It seemed as though this
place had also been set up in accordance with an Autarch’s plans…
but why had none of it been written down on the stone stele?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.” The
flaming equine stood in the air above that narrow strip of land, its
body blazing with flames so hot that the air around it was bubbling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s.” Ning
instantly transformed into a streak of light as he shot over towards
the flaming equine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flaming equine
moved as well, its four hooves galloping across the air itself as it
suddenly sped up. It immediately moved more than a hundred times the
speed of light… and in fact, it was even faster than the sea
dragon. Its flying speed was absolutely ferocious! It lowered its
head slightly, pointing its horns straight at its foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning once more
used his most savage strike, the Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker. His
sword shot out, smoting furiously upon the flaming equine’s skull!
As for the equine, it didn’t dodge at all; it just continued its
headlong charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous explosion
rang out! The flaming equine trembled slightly as it staggered more
than three hundred meters backwards, while Ning was actually blasted
more than a thousand kilometers away before Ning came to a halt. Ning
was secretly shocked: “Just like the sea dragon said… this beast
specializes in overwhelmingly ferocious attacks. It really is
ferocious; it’s even stronger than my Omega Sword Dao -
Heavenbreaker! Perfect! Only foes like this are strong enough for me
to temper my sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he needed to do
was to take that one final step and become a Daolord of the Fourth
Step. To do that, he needed sufficient challenges to face!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gwaaaaaar!” The
flaming equine’s entire body was covered in flames as it galloped
across the skies towards Ji Ning with frenetic momentum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning transformed
into a streak of light, clashing against the flaming equine time and
time again in midair. Sometimes he fought it head-on, sometimes he
used unpredictable movements, and sometimes he completely disappeared
into thin air… but once he moved closer to the creature, he was
forced to show himself by its blazing flames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an incredibly
exciting battle. The shockwaves generated by the repeated collisions
blasted out in every direction, causing Ninedust to repeatedly move
backwards as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power!
Darknorth is growing stronger and stronger.” Ninedust was excited
by what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve fought to
a standstill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The flame beast
holds an advantage in power, while the kid holds an advantage in
unpredictability. Still… based on what I can tell, this battle
should be depleting quite a bit of the kid’s divine power and
Immortal energy. Once a bit more time passes, it’ll be hard for the
kid to stay in top fighting form, whereas his opponent can draw from
the energy of the endless sea of flames. It’d be easy for him to
stay in battle for ten years or even a hundred years without resting.
If things proceed like this, the kid’s probably going to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, if the young
fellow wishes to win, he needs to win as soon as possible. The longer
this drags out, the greater his chances of losing will be.” The two
races of beasts watching from the sidelines all commented with
interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day… two days…
three days… Ning continued to battle against the flaming equine in
midair, the two landing on the ground every so often to continue the
battle there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s definitely
going to lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look! His sword-arts
aren’t able to maintain that mist-form from before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He probably has
depleted too much divine power and Immortal energy. He’s unable to
maintain it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been too
long. He’s lost.” The majority of the watching beasts all came to
this conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between Ning
and the flaming equine lasted for an extremely long period of time.
By the third day, Ning gave up on using the [Heartsword] art! This
was because the [Heartsword] art allowed Ning to fight the flaming
equine to a standstill… and Ning had quickly discovered the flaming
equine’s flaws! Whenever Ning wished it, he would be able to
quickly defeat the creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… Ning’s
greatest goal was to break through to become a Daolord of the Fourth
Step. What he needed was a good opponent to temper himself against!
This was why, after the third day, he pretended to be exhausted and
stopped using the [Heartsword] art. Without it strengthening him, his
power instantly dropped by half! This caused him to immediately be at
a disadvantage and be suppressed by the flaming equine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is perfect.
Now, I can truly test out my sword-arts. Mm… yes, I see many more
flaws in my sword-arts that I previously had not discovered. I need
to perfectly master and merge the mysteries of these five stances
into a whole. Only then will my sword-arts be truly flawless and
complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was being
dominated and beaten down, but this only showed him more clearly the
weaknesses in his sword-arts. His mind was now filled with many new
insights… but these insights weren’t enough! He would need far
more if he wished to merge his five stances into the fourth stage of
the Omega Sword Dao and then become a Daolord of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
nineteen days had passed with Ning and the flaming equine locked in
combat. This caused the many watching beasts to feel puzzled: “The
kid’s actually been able to hang on for nineteen days?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That couldn’t have
been easy. He’s clearly much weaker now, but he’s still been able
to hold on… not bad at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will end in
defeat, but an honorable one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to dodge
and stumble about while defending with his six swords. Suddenly, his
movements changed as a sharp light flashed through his eyes. “Time
to bring it to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light once
more formed into streams of mist as the power of his strikes
increased twofold! With a boom, Ning’s strikes collided against the
flaming equine, catching it off-guard and sending it stumbling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Slash! Slash! Slash! Ning’s six swords suddenly disappeared without
a trace, reappearing much closer to the equine when its flames forced
them to manifest. The six swords were like a peacock unfurling its
plumage. They were absolutely incandescent yet completely ghostly in
their movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the flaming
equine was quite valiant and doughty, Ning had used the Heavenbreaker
stance and the Blood Drop stance to break through its guard, then
used the Shadowless stance to quickly wrap his swords around its
bodies. The divine swords transformed to become long and flexible,
coiling around the flaming beast and quickly tying the entire thing
up securely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” The
trussled flame beast had a look of disbelief on its face. “How
could this have happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It clearly recalled
what had just happened. It had endured the Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop, Heavenbreaker, and Shadowless multiple times by now; those
techniques were of no threat to it. How was it that this time, it had
been defeated?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, if Ning had
merely used those three stances by themselves, he wouldn’t have
been able to pose a threat to the creature at all. However, when he
used all three together in a manner where they reinforced each other,
he was able to capitalize on a weakness in the flaming equine’s
movements and thus capture and bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An effective
combination of attacks could cause one to become quite a bit more
dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again! Let’s do it
again! I can’t accept this outcome.” The flaming equine was
furiously struggling against its bonds, twisting and turning while it
roared angrily, “You got lucky just now! I was over-confident.
Let’s fight again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” When Ning
saw the uncowed look on the flaming equine’s face, Ning silently
muttered to himself, “If I didn’t want to use you to temper my
sword-arts, I would’ve captured you on the very first day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A defeat is a
defeat,” an ancient voice rang out. The stately clan leader flew
out from within the ranks of the hundred or so flaming equines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” The
tied-up equine was still rather unwilling to accept this outcome.
“I-I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just look at
yourself. You’ve been tied up like a baby.” The flaming equine
turned to look at Ning. “This young fellow’s sword-arts can
switch between being supremely hard and supremely soft, between being
fast and being slow, and is defensively impenetrable. It truly has no
weaknesses at all. As soon as he unleashed his full power, he
instantly captured you. Although it was partially because of your own
over-confidence, even if you were careful you still probably wouldn’t
have been able to hold out too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
startled. The clan leader really had good judgment. It was true that
part of the reason why he had been able to instantly capture the
flaming equine was because he hadn’t used the [Heartsword] art
during the past ten-plus days. His sudden usage of it and the
corresponding increase in power had caught the flaming equine
off-guard, allowing him to catch it with ease. If his foe was
prepared, Ning still would’ve been able to capture him, but it
wouldn’t have been nearly this easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
captured equine nodded submissively. The clan leader’s prestige was
quite high and had a suppressive effect on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young fellow, you
won. From this moment forth, our two clans will no longer stand in
your path.” The flaming equine leader looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
retracting the Northbow swords which had been wrapped around the
flaming equine and drawing them back into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two battles
have benefited me tremendously,” Ning said with a respectful bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The similarly
stately and reserved leader of the sea dragons flew out of deep blue
sea and towards Ning. It landed next to Ning, then let out a laugh:
“Hah! It has been a very, very long time since a Daolord has passed
the trials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When was the last
time a Daolord passed the trials?” Ning asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very long ago, more
than nine hundred thousand chaos cycles ago.” The sea dragon leader
peered at Ning. “I think his name was Daolord Coldsky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coldsky?” Ning was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Coldsky?
Who?” Ninedust was puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone capable of
passing this trial had to be just as strong as the current Ning. By
all rights, he should’ve been an incredibly famous figure. Even
though nearly a million chaos cycles had gone by and very few
would’ve remembered him, people like Ning and Ninedust who had
access to many historical records and secrets should’ve heard of
him. They knew all of the most dazzling and most talented Daolords in
history. Neither, however, had ever heard of an incredibly talented
Daolord by the name of Daolord Coldsky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, Daolord
Coldsky said that he belonged to a different branch of the Aeonian
race. He had been invited here to help out the Flamedragon branch,”
the sea dragon leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A different branch?”
Ning and Ninedust were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Other realmverses
also have Aeonians?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonian race has
quite an extraordinary background.” The sea dragon leader smiled.
“The ones in the Flamedragon Realmverse represent nothing more than
a single branch of that race. Otherwise, how could they possibly have
acquired a treasure like this ‘Aeonian Kingdom’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both enlightened. Indeed, the Aeonian Kingdom was a place which not
even Hegemons dared to trespass within. It really wasn’t a treasure
which the local Aeonians, a race which merely had a few Eternal
Emperors, would’fe been able to create on their own. Ning had
always believed that the Aeonians must’ve acquired it somewhere
when adventuring. Now, it seemed, it was actually created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Coldsky had
already failed his Daomerge, but before his death he was invited to
come here to the Flamedragon Realmverse. Ignoring the cost to his
vitality, he consecutively defeated two of the younger members of our
two races. By the time the battles concluded, his truesoul’s
collapsed had been hastened to the point where he only had less than
a hundred thousand years to live.” The sea dragon leader shook its
head and sighed. “The more monstrously talented a Daolord, the more
difficult the Daomerge. A pity, what a pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt mixed
emotions in his heart. If he failed his Daomerge, he would probably
do everything he could to help the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the Daomerge was
failed, one’s truesoul would slowly crumble apart. If one actively
avoided using divine power and Immortal energy, one might be able to
live for a bit longer… but engaging in combat would result in
hastening the truesoul’s collapse! The more times one fought, the
more quickly one’s truesoul would decay and the shorter one’s
lifespan would become. When the truesoul finally, truly collapsed…
one would die.

Chapter 9 - Omnigeddon Bloodfruit Tree
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamedragon
branch of the Aeonian race will generally send people once every
million chaos cycles to harvest some fruit from this omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree.” The sea dragon leader’s voice was quite calm:
“That’s because every million chaos cycles, this omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree will be filled with a complete harvest of fruit.
They’ll either send their own Daolords or ask some extremely
powerful Daolords to help out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Ninedust
both nodded. Generally speaking, every two or three ‘eras’ there
would be a Daolord on par with the current Ning. Some would have
techniques like the [Heartsword] art, some would have Universe
treasures, some would have other special weapons. Daolord Dreamlore,
for example, had a very unique ‘bloodblade’, while Ning had an
incredibly powerful Hegemon armor which was on par with the
bloodblade in might. However, the Hegemon armor was obviously meant
for defense. Another good example would be the six lifeblood weapons
which Ning wielded; all of them had been raised to incredibly high
levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful Eternal
Emperors lived extremely long lives and generally were able to raise
their lifeblood weapons to extremely high levels, but Daolords had
short lives. It was generally very hard for them to upgrade their
lifeblood weapons significantly… but every so often, there would be
a freak like Ning. Ning’s Northbow swords were incredibly powerful
weapons; by now, they made his Heavenbreaker stance and Blood Drop
stance five times more powerful than normal! If the Daolord himself
was also quite powerful, it was entirely possible for the Daolord to
reach the same level as the Archons of the eight Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my guess is
correct… you weren’t invited here by the Aeonians, were you?”
The sea dragon leader smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They weren’t
invited by the Aeonians?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?” Quite a few of the airborne beasts were astonished. Most
of them had assumed that Ning and Ninedust had to have been invited
here by the Aeonians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust felt
their hearts lurch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the moment you
arrived,” the flaming equine leader added, “I could tell that you
know almost nothing about this place. If the Aeonians invited you
here, you should be quite familiar with this place and its rules…
but you didn’t even know the basics about the trials and its
rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust felt
resigned. They really didn’t know anything about this place.
Ninedust sent mentally, “Darknorth, if these beasts attack us I’ll
lead you in an immediate escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, you
two. We’re here on the Autarch’s orders to protect this place and
will bar any Daolords or Emperors who seek to approach,” the sea
dragon leader said with a laugh. “We won’t stop any who pass our
trials. Whether you are an Aeonian or not is none of our business.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, if we
wanted to kill you, we would’ve done so long ago.” The flaming
equine leader could also tell that Ning and Ninedust both had
misgivings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
confident in their abilities. They were carrying the treasures they
had acquired from the Sithe ruins, and they had the Autarch’s
medallion on them; their chances of fleeing were quite good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As juniors, we
naturally will believe your words, seniors. Dare I ask… is that
fruit tree over there truly an omnigeddon bloodfruit tree?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course it is,”
the flaming equine leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… why does it
seem different from the ones I’m aware of?” Ning was puzzled.
“I’ve heard that omnigeddon bloodfruit trees are much smaller and
only have three fruits at most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree is a hundred times more precious than ordinary ones,”
the flaming equine leader said. “Every single fruit is also far
more marvelous than the ones from ordinary trees in the outside
world. Haha… words don’t suffice. Once you harvest the fruit and
give it a close examination, you will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
speechless. Moments later, Ning grew excited. A hundred times as
valuable? A single true omnigeddon bloodfruit tree was a priceless
treasure that even Hegemons would go crazy over! Something a hundred
times more valuable… Ning estimated that it had to approach the
value of Crimsonwave Temple in worth. Even if it wasn’t quite that
much, it wouldn’t be too far off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This tree is
probably worth more than the networth of most Hegemons, right?”
Ning couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! The
Aeonian race in the Flamedragon Realmverse treat this fruit tree as
something more valuable than their very lives,” the flaming equine
leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately came
to the decision that he not only was going to harvest the fruit, he
was going to uproot this tree! He was going to uproot this
mysterious, unique omnigeddon bloodfruit tree and take it away with
him at all costs! This mysterious tree might be enough to ask an
Autarch to revive his wife. His goal was within his sight; there was
no way he wasn’t going to give it his all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, are you
thinking of uprooting the tree to save your Dao-companion?”
Ninedust sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that Ning
wished to rescue his lover wasn’t exactly a secret. When Ning had
met the leaders of the six major organizations after exiting
Crimsonwave Temple, he had already asked about the price needed to
reverse the flows of spacetime and revive his beloved Dao-companion.
Ninedust had been present and had heard everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree sounds as though it is quite valuable; I should be
able to use it to ask an Autarch to help out! I have to take this
risk!” Ning sent mentally, “Let’s keep this a secret for now.
If I mention taking the tree away, these two races might move to stop
us. I’m planning on uprooting it at the very end. After doing so,
we’ll leave right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, I’ll
listen to you!” Ninedust felt happy for his friend. The omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree might be quite valuable, but Ninedust really didn’t
care that much about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust began
to walk towards the tree. The two clan leaders led the way in front
of them, with the sea dragon leader rumbling, “We won’t move to
stop Daolord Darknorth, but Daolord Ninedust, you haven’t passed
our trials yet. We’ll only permit you to stand next to him and
watch. You are forbidden from taking part, much less harvesting any
of the fruit. If you dare to do so, don’t blame us from moving to
exterminate you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand,”
Ninedust acknowledged. In his heart, he felt quite resigned…
because his title was Daolord Redwater, not Daolord Ninedust! Alas,
he didn’t want to argue over it. They were going to leave soon and
most likely would never meet again. Why even bother?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning and Ninedust
arrived before the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree. “Whoah.” Both of
them felt quite stunned. The entire tree had to be over three million
meters high, and its trunk was as thick as the pillars of heaven. As
for its twisted branches, they were like sinuous dragons that were
covered with glowing, vitality-filled leaves. And the fruits? It must
be understood that the two of them were able to sense the rippling
auras of the fruits from far away. Now that they were much closer,
those ripples surged straight into their hearts and minds. Even their
breathing was affected by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fine
treasure,” Ning said with a praiseful sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is far more
stunning than the fruit trees we saw in Crimsonwave Temple.”
Ninedust sighed in amazement as well. The feeling this mysterious
fruit tree gave him surpassed even the majestic aura of Hegemons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only by combining
all of those trees would you have something which surpassed this one.
Of course it is stunning!” Ning’s heart was surging with
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby sea dragon
leader said, “The Aeonians have set up many layers of barriers
around this tree. Do you have a technique to open those barriers up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
startled. Ning waved his hand, sending a wave of Immortal energy out
and causing the formerly invisible and hidden barriers to immediately
light up. Countless runes flowed on the surfaces of those barriers,
causing Ning’s face to tighten. They weren’t invited here by the
Aeonians; they naturally had no method for opening it up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But they don’t
seem to be too strong,” Ning suddenly realized with surprise. Based
on what he just saw, he should be able to destroy these barriers
within a short period of time with his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course they
aren’t. Only Daolords have come here, and so these were personally
set up by the Daolords who did make it inside,” the sea dragon
leader said. “They brought many formations and barriers, but
unfortunately they are on automatic mode. No one is actively managing
them, which weakens them even further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and Ninedust
nodded. Formations which were actively controlled would be far more
powerful. Without a controller present, they would be set to
automatic and would thus naturally be much weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing the
Aeonians could do. Were they supposed to send Daolords to guard this
place? Daolords only lived for 108,000 chaos cycles at most! Send
Emperors? Eternal Emperors had zero chance of passing the trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although they aren’t
all that strong, there are quite a number of them. Based on what I
know, the Aeonians have set up a total of over 80,000 formations
here,” the sea dragon leader said. “If you know the technique for
unlocking the barriers, you can go through with ease. If not, you’ll
have to break through all 80,000+ barriers before you can move next
to the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t break
through the formations, you won’t be able to harvest so much as a
single fruit,” the flaming equine leader said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the clan leaders
smiled as they looked at Ning. They wanted to see just what this
young fellow would do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than 80,000?”
Ning’s face tightened. Just now, he was able to sense that the
outermost formation was quite weak. He would probably be able to
destroy it with his sword-arts, but… 80,000? How long would that
take? If some of the inner barriers were tougher, things would be
even more difficult.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 10 - Uprooting the Tree
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Ninedust
sent mentally, “Darknorth, should we use our Hegemonic treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, we don’t have
that many of them to begin with. Once we use them up, we’ll be
out,” Ji Ning refused mentally. “We’re keeping those to keep
ourselves alive at critical moments. I’ll try a few things out
first. Even if it takes me a million years or a hundred million
years, that’ll be better than wasting a Hegemonic treasure.
Besides… even if we did use it, it wouldn’t be of that much use
to us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that by now,
he might be at a disadvantage when fighting against an actual Archon
of the Sacred Cities but he was definitely on their overall level!
His Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker was capable of unleashing
enormous power with a full-strength spike… and yet, it still
probably wouldn’t be able to burst open one of those barriers
instantly. Although the Hegemonic treasures were formidable and on a
higher level of power than Ning, and they would most likely be able
to shatter through a number of barriers, it was likely that they
would at most be able to shatter through just a thousand barriers
with each go. Unfortunately, there were over 80,000 barriers here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try first.”
Ning’s body blurred as he transformed into his three-headed,
six-armed form and drew his six Northbow swords. Ninedust stepped
back to watch from the side; all he could do was watch and wait.
There was nothing he could do to assist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao -
Blood Drop!” A cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes as he
immediately executed his most penetrating attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streams of
mist-formed energy consecutively stabbed against the exact same spot
upon the barrier in front of Ning. The powerful piercing force
instantly caused the outermost layer of formations to flicker with
light as countless runes began to flow over its surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao -
Heavenbreaker!” Next, Ning switched to a different stance. There
were differences amongst barriers as well; some were extremely
flexible and soft, making brute force useless and requiring
penetrative power to break through. Others were extremely rigid and
unyielding; in this case, the overwhelming power of the Heavenbreaker
stance would be the most appropriate and effective. Some barriers
were actually illusory!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was very different
from when he had to defeat the formations at Crimsonwave Temple.
Those formations were there as part of a test! The formations here,
however, had been set down by the Aeonians as a defensive measure to
prevent others from stealing their treasures. They naturally poured
everything they had into these formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, without anyone
controlling these formations, they won’t be able to heal as quickly
as I deplete their power. The end result will definitely be their
destruction.” Ning quickly discovered a weakness in the formation,
then immediately used his Blood Drop stance as the primary attack to
break through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a single hour
later, the barrier fell. Although it was able to automatically
regenerate, it wasn’t able to keep up with the rate at which its
power was being depleted. After breaking through the formation, Ning
casually destroyed one of its formation-bases! If he didn’t do so,
the formation would quickly regenerate and trap Ning inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One formation after
another. Some were actually linked together, making it very hard for
Ning to break through them. He was actually forced to use his
Immortal energy to control the Northbow swords in attacking different
formations in different regions simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Break, break, break…
one layer of barriers after another was breached by Ning’s attacks.
Although the Aeonians had paid enormous prices to set up these
barriers, they were weakened by the fact that they were unmanned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed on.
One year, two years, three years… ten years, a hundred years, a
thousand years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While breaking through
the formations, Ning continuously worked on his sword-arts. He felt
as though he was virtually sparring with these many generations of
departed formations masters. Some of these formations had been set up
by the Aeonians themselves, while others they had purchased from the
outside. Every single formation was difficult to breach, and while
doing so Ning gained more and more insights into his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that my
[Heartsword] art has yet to make a breakthrough. It seems as though
going from the tenth stance to the eleventh stance truly is
difficult,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single strike of
his was reinforced by the [Heartsword] art, which showed itself as a
mist-formed layer of sword energy. It must be remembered that when
one truly trained in the [Heartsword] art, the eighth to tenth
stances were considered part of the first stage. The eleventh and
twelfth stances were part of the second stage, the thirteenth and
fourteenth stances were part of the third stage, and the fifteenth
stance was the final stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still stuck in
the first stage, and breaking through to the second stage was very,
very difficult. Although the three hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies he
had gained included a few similar techniques which also involved
fusing heartforce with divine power and Immortal energy, in the end
Ning was an expert of the Dao of the Sword; studying through this Dao
was the fastest solution, making the [Heartsword] art the most
appropriate art for him. The others could at most be used as
references to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reviewing the
other techniques, Ning understood that gaining true mastery of the
[Heartsword] art was possible only through one way - true and utter
devotion to this Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, knowing and
doing are two completely separate concepts. He knew what he had to
do, but he still was unable to make the necessary breakthroughs. If
breaking through was that easy, Emperor Heartsword wouldn’t have
been the only person in all of history to have been able to truly
master this [Heartsword] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than eighteen
million years went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Northbow swords
were hanging in the air, furiously stabbing downwards in an illusory
manner. Finally, with a popping sound, the last barrier was broken
through by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” The
distant Ninedust revealed a delighted look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually able
to break through over 80,000 barriers with just sword-arts.” The
two clan leaders were both rather startled. These formations
encompassed every type of barrier possible, including bewildering and
illusory ones. Thankfully, Ning was a Heartforce Cultivator and thus
wouldn’t be misled by them. Otherwise, he probably wouldn’t have
been able to resolve those formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
just stood there, his six Northbow swords hanging in the air. The
swords descended in unison, flying back into the sheath on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief. He could sense that the past eighteen million
years of formation-breaking had been a form of tempering for his
sword-arts. He now had gained quite a few new insights into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I still have no
clue as to how I am going to reach the fourth stage with the Omega
Sword Dao. Becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step truly is difficult,”
Ning sighed to himself. He really didn’t have much hope; all he
could do was to continuously advance. Sooner or later, he would break
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend
Darknorth, these fruits are all quite extraordinary. They are far
more valuable than ordinary omnigeddon bloodfruits,” the sea dragon
leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to glance
at it. The two clan leaders were both staring at Ning, as were the
nearly two hundred beasts off in the distance. To them, the past
eighteen million years had been nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance. Both of them knew what had to be done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,”
Ninedust sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Ning replied mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning’s body
blurred as it suddenly expanded dramatically in size. He instantly
became the size of a towering mountain that was three million meters
tall, the same height as the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You grew pretty
big,” the flaming equine leader said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes harvesting
easier.” Ning reached out with his hand, easily plucking one of the
flame-colored fruits at the very crown of the omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree, then putting it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some fruits
which could only be harvested in certain ways; for example, there
were certain fruits which would vanish when touched by the hand. The
omnigeddon bloodfruit, however, could only grow if they underwent ten
thousand tribulations during their growing process! It was fine to
harvest them by hand; they weren’t delicate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the thirty-six
fruits growing throughout the tree were completely harvested. Ning
lowered his head to harvest the final fruit located at the base of
the tree. He pulled the fruit into his estate-world with a thought,
then reached out with both hands to grasp the trunk of the
omnigeddoon bloodfruit tree. He immediately sent out his divine power
to cover every inch of the tree, protecting its roots and branches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get up.” Ning
exerted his power, allowing his full might to be unleashed. Boom! In
the end, the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree was nothing more than a tree;
the Azureflower Estate world’s fruit trees had been warded by the
master of the estate, which was why Ning was unable to damage them.
In fact, he had been restricted to harvesting just a single fruit.
The omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, however, was ‘only’ protected by
those 80,000+ barriers. By now, Ning had long since destroyed those
barriers, and without them blocking his path he was able to easily
harvest all of the fruit from the tree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The entire
massive omnigeddon bloodfruit tree was uprooted from the earthy
ground. Countless roots began to rise up out of the earth, but the
layer of divine power covering the tree ensured that it was
completely undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s…” the two
clan leaders and all of the spectating beasts stared in amazement at
this sight. The massive tree had just been uprooted by the similarly
massive Ji Ning, who moved so fast that they weren’t even able to
react in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” With
but a thought, Ning easily drew the uprooted omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree into his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” After
putting away the tree, Ning had been feeling quite excited and
planning to flee alongside Ninedust. In fact, Ninedust had already
flown towards him like a streak of light… but the look on Ning’s
face had changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! After he uprooted
the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, an enormous crevice had revealed
itself underneath him. This enormous crevice was extremely deep, and
at the very bottom of it there was a small pool of red liquid! This
small pool of what looked like congealed blood was also thirty
thousand meters in size! It rolled about like a miniature red sun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, the
omnigeddon bloodfruit tree had been blocking it out, with Ning not
having sensed its aura at all. Now that Ning had already uprooted the
tree, he could sense a stately and ancient power instantly emanate
outwards.

Chapter 11 - Autarch’s Blood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt as though
he was an ant who was facing the vast, starry night sky. Ning
instantly turned pale, finding it hard to breathe as that aura of
power swept outwards. It was simply terrifying. The aura of that glob
of blood… it vastly surpassed the auras of any of the Hegemons Ning
had met thus far! Although Hegemons had incredible auras, they
couldn’t even compare to the blood-red ‘sun’ that was glowing
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At Ning’s current
level of power, he was strong enough to smile and jest in the
presence of Hegemons. But when faced with this pool of red blood, he
felt utter terror from every fiber of his very being!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is that?!”
Ninedust came charging over. He had been planning to take Ning away
and flee, but he was instantly dazed when he saw that large pool of
blood-red liquid, roughly thirty thousand meters in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend… it is useless for you to take away that omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree.” The sea dragon leader began to laugh. “The
reason why that tree was so marvelous was all due to this drop of
blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust stood
next to each other. They could leave this world whenever they wished,
and so they were in no haste to flee just yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I uprooted the
bloodfruit tree. Don’t you care?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why should we care?”
The sea dragon leader laughed, “Long ago, this world didn’t even
have the bloodfruit tree in it. For you to uproot it does nothing to
us at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this world
originally didn’t have a bloodfruit tree in it… where did it come
from?” The nearby Ninedust asked, “And… did you just say that
this giant pool of liquid is a drop of blood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, a drop of
blood. This is a drop of blood which Autarch Bolin created after
pouring tremendous amounts of work and essence into it, and it is
filled with boundless mysteries,” the sea dragon leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Autarch’s
blood?” Ning and Ninedust were enlightened. This wasn’t just a
random drop of blood from Autarch Bolin; it was something which
Autarch Bolin had spent tremendous effort in refining. No wonder it
was so terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long, long ago,
Autarch Bolin left behind this drop of blood. We have been here on
the Autarch’s orders, and we are to prevent all cultivators from
reaching it. Daolords, Emperors… everyone must pass the trials
before gaining access to this drop of blood,” the sea dragon leader
said. “Later on, the Aeonians discovered this place and came here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They realized that
the Autarch’s blood was simply too powerful! Thus, they came up
with a way to graft the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, a tree with
tremendously strong vital energy, on top of it. The tree naturally
rooted itself around the Autarch’s blood, and over the course of
many years it began to slowly evolve and transform before it finally
managed to draw some of the essence from the blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After absorbing some
of the Autarch’s blood, it began to grow larger and larger while
giving birth to more and more fruit. Now, it has finally reached a
size of three million kilometers and can give birth to a crop of
thirty-six fruit at a time,” the sea dragon leader said. “Every
single fruit is far more special than ordinary omnigeddon bloodfruit,
because they were grown from an Autarch’s blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This tree has spent
more than thirty million chaos cycles absorbing the blood and has
already transformed. It shall always produce thirty-six fruits with
each harvest. However, now that you have uprooted it, it no longer
has access to the Autarcvh’s blood and so the fruit it produces
shall most likely be nothing more than ordinary omnigeddon
bloodfruits. That makes the value of this tree much lower than
before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face
tightened. True. Ordinary omnigeddon bloodfruit trees produced three
fruits per harvest, while this one produced thirty-six! This made it
comparable to twelve ‘ordinary’ bloodfruit trees. However, the
fruit only possessed miraculous properties due to having absorbed
blood from the Autarch. That was the reason why the tree could be
described as having a hundred times the value of an ordinary tree!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just ten or so
times?” Ning knew that he couldn’t be too greedy, but he still
felt rather disappointed. This sort of treasure was not nearly enough
to ask an Autarch to help out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea dragon leader
suddenly said, “The Autarch said that if one day, someone arrives
who is capable of taking away this drop of blood, our two races shall
regain our freedom. Darknorth, my young friend, you can try for
yourself whether or not you can take the Autarch’s blood away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, if you can take
it away, we shall regain our freedom.” The flaming equine leader
grew excited as well, as did the hundreds of beasts within the world.
Life here was simply too boring. Many of them had been born here, but
the oldest ones had been sent here by Autarch Bolin himself. They
knew just how lively the outside world was, whereas this place was
incredibly dull and lonely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it away?”
Ning and Ninedust were intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was created by
the Autarch, who poured all of his effort into its creation. It is
incomparably precious, far more than a hundred times more valuable
than the tree you just uprooted. Most likely, even other Autarchs
would very much desire to acquire this drop of blood and learn some
of Autarch Bolin’s secrets from it.” The sea dragon leader
continued to describe how valuable this drop of blood was, causing
Ning to feel even more eager.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, give it a
shot.” Ninedust looked at Ning and sent mentally, “You’d
definitely be able to revive your Dao-companion if you acquire this
drop of special Autarch’s blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
shot.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately flying into that
enormous crevice. As he moved closer to it, he saw that the round
pool of blood was beginning to swivel and emanate auras of increasing
power. Ning had to clamp down upon his fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he couldn’t
prevent himself from feeling terrified, he didn’t feel any sense of
danger at all. This meant that this blood drop wouldn’t cause any
harm to him. Autarch Bolin had left it behind for future generations
of cultivators to benefit from, not die from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning exerted
his will, causing a divine power clone to appear next to the pool.
The clone reached out with its right hand to touch the giant pool of
blood. Ning wanted to be careful; this way, he would at most lose a
bit of his divine power rather than his own life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The drop of
blood was incredibly cold, but it didn’t cause Ning’s clone any
harm at all. “Arise.” The divine power clone tested out applying
a bit of power to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the drop of
blood immediately began to shake and shudder. Silken lines began to
appear all across this entire vast planet, with all of the lines
converging upon the drop of blood. Ning’s divine clone was
completely unable to move it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” Seeing
this, Ning moved his true body over to the pool. He manifested three
heads and six arms, then reached out with all six arms while using
his Hegemon armor to cover and protect his hands as they delved into
the pool of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled, hard.
Boom! It was like an ant trying to shake a tree; the countless lines
across the world connecting to this blood drop fought against him. If
Ning wanted to move this blood drop, he would have to be able to
overcome the might of this entire planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lift it up! Move it
away!” The two clan leaders and the hundreds of beasts all watched
eagerly. The day this drop of blood was taken would be the day they
completed their responsibility to test the cultivators who came to
this place. Only then would they be able to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise. Arise.
Arise!” Ning did his utmost, but there was no way he could overcome
the full power of this entire planet. This was an estate-world which
had been created by an Autarch, after all; it was incredibly stable
and not something which the likes of him could shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the Aeonian
Kingdom. There was a beautiful, ancient palace here which served as
the central temple for the entire kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome youth was
seated atop the royal throne within the temple, dressed in elegant
black robes. His aura was awe-inspiring and remote. He was the true
supreme leader of the Aeonian race… Emperor Anchen. He had been
protecting this place since time out of mind, because this temple was
connected to the five most important ancestral grounds of the Aeonian
race. Every single one of the five was extremely important… but of
course, the most important was the ‘first ancestral ground’. This
was because it had been left behind by Autarch Bolin himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… suddenly, a
tremor swept through the palace. Emperor Anchen was connected to all
five ancestral grounds as their protector; he naturally noticed it
and immediately turned pale. “The first ancestral ground! Its
shaking!?” This was a world which had been created by Autarch
Bolin, and the Aeonians knew it well; the only thing which could
cause that entire world to shake was if someone was acting against
the Autarch’s blood, the most important treasure of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Islehide,
Emperor Duug, there may be invaders within the first ancestral
ground. Come right away!” Emperor Anchen sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few seconds
later… swoosh! Swoosh! Two figures simultaneously appeared. One was
the handsome, red-haired Emperor Islehide; the other was the tall,
skinny, and pale-faced Emperor Duug. The two had been shocked by what
they had just heard and had immediately hastened over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were the
three most powerful Emperors of the Aeonian race here in the ‘Endless
Territories’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are invaders
in the first ancestral ground?” Emperor Islehide and Emperor Duug
were both anxious and filled with murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, go in right
away,” Emperor Anchen shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
bodies of the three Emperors began to blaze with flames. These flames
were generated by the igniting of the Aeonian blood. To open the link
to the first ancestral ground was extremely difficult; an enormous
price would have to first be paid. However, now that something
strange was going on inside they could no longer afford to worry
about it.

Chapter 12 - Devastating Rage
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three most powerful
Emperors of the Aeonian race were all covered in blazing flames which
began to reach out and connect to each other, slowly forming a
strange diagram of a giant claw-shaped hand. This looked like the
technique which Autarch Bolin had left behind in that beastworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. The flames from
the ignited Aeonian blood instantly reached out to cover all three
Emperors. Swoosh! They were teleported straight into the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move as fast
as we can.” The three Emperors stared at the void around them, then
turned to look at the astral river. They knew that they had already
arrived, and Emperor Anchen shouted anxiously, “If we’re late,
things will be even more difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Whoosh! Emperor Anchen generated a dimensional wave and led the other
two Emperors with him as he instantly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This world was
extremely stable; not even Hegemons would be able to forcibly tear
through spacetime, much less them! However, mere dimensional
teleportation was much simpler, as it was merely an evasion-art which
rode dimensional waves across fairly short distances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There we are.”
After the third dimensional wave, they appeared in the skies above
that enormous, strange planet within the astral river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…!” Emperor
Islehide’s face instantly turned pale, and his scarlet eyes
instantly turned blood-red. “The tree! Our omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree has vanished!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen and
Emperor Duug stared as well. They saw that off in the distance, there
were ripples of energy spreading outwards and pushing aside the
surrounding mist. The three of them were able to see that nothing
more than a giant crater was left where the omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree had been, and within the crater was a giant figure which was
holding onto the Autarch’s blood and seeking to take it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not only did he take
away our omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, he also wants to take away the
Autarch’s blood?” Emperor Anchen was so enraged that he ground
his teeth to the point of shattering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Darknorth and the Ninedust Sectlord!” Emperor Islehide immediately
recognized that Ji Ning was the one holding onto the Autarch’s
blood, while the figure next to the crater was that of Ninedust.
Emperor Islehide had met the two of them after the Waveshift Realm
adventure, and he had even purchased some fruit from Ning. Now,
however, they had become mortal enemies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two are
nothing more than Daolords… yet they dare to try and steal one of
the foundations of our Aeonian race?” Emperor Anchen only grew even
angrier. “Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them both,”
Emperor Duug growled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Emperor
Islehide felt just as murderous as the others. They held these two
Daolords in no regard at all. They were the three most powerful
Emperors of the Aeonian race! They normally viewed Daolords as young
children; they were so powerful that eating Daolords was of very
little help to them. Weaker Emperors like Melobo, however, did like
to eat the Daolords of the Dao Alliance, as did the other Daolords of
the Aeonian race. This was why the Dao Alliance and the Aeonians were
mortal enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had transformed to
become utterly titanic, and his six arms had reached out to grab the
drop of Autarch’s blood as he sought to seize it. With each
attempt, he saw those countless connecting lines appear throughout
this entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These threads?”
Ning stared at them carefully. He wanted to try and discern just how
this drop of Autarch’s blood was connected to the rest of the world
and how he could separate them. If he could come up with a way to
sever the connection, it would be much easier for him to take away
that drop of Autarch’s blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent over 10
million years breaking through those 80,000+ formations. He had
already grown accustomed to analyzing and dissecting his problems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonians!”
Ninedust let out a startled cry from the skies above Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled upon
hearing this. He turned his head, only to see three figures charging
through the skies towards him with looks of absolute murder on their
faces. Ning immediately recognized one of the three as Emperor
Islehide, who had negotiated with him previously. Although he had
never met the other two before, he had learned of them long ago and
knew them to be extremely powerful Emperors of the Aeonian race named
Emperor Anchen and Emperor Duug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Islehide,
Emperor Anchen, and Emperor Duug. These three were all comparable to
the eight Archons of the Sacred Cities. But of course, much like
‘first-tier’ Daolords there were differences in power within this
general stratum and amongst these three Aeonian Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different weapons,
different secret arts, different ultimate attacks… in short, there
were many things that could cause a difference in power. Thanks to
their Aeonian bloodlines, all three of these Aeonian Emperors were
extremely strong. The youthful-looking black-robed Emperor Anchen was
the strongest of the three, the most powerful member of the Aeonian
race! Supposedly, his techniques were incredibly frightening and he
had access to a Universe treasure. He probably wasn’t much weaker
than a Hegemon in might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leaders,”
Ninedust sent anxiously, “You said that any cultivators who come
here must pass your trials. The three Emperors of the Aeonian race
should also have to pass the trials, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” The
sea dragon leader nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
flaming equine leader nodded its massive head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea dragon leader
flew into the skies, coiling around itself in midair as it let out a
deep, rumbling bellow: “Halt, Emperors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you do not halt,
you shall be attacked by both of our races at the same time.” The
flaming equine stood there on the ground, its entire body blazing
with flames as it let out a furious, awesome roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HALT!” There were
nearly two hundred beasts in this area, and they roared out this word
in unison with unstoppable majesty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
The three Emperors who had been diving downwards through the skies
came to a screeching halt, ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s uprooted our
omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, and now he wants to take away the
Autarch’s blood!” Emperor Anchen stood there in the skies,
staring angrily at the distant sea dragon leader as he bellowed, “We
Aeonians are definitely going to kill these two thieves! Daolord
Darknorth, Ninedust Sectlord… the two of you really are quite bold!
How DARE you steal treasures from the ancestral grounds of the
Aeonian race?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestral grounds?”
Ning flew over to Ninedust, and the two stared back at the three
Emperors. With the two races of beasts standing guard over them, they
didn’t panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our two clans are
here on the Autarch’s orders to protect this place. Anyone who
wishes to benefit from the Autarch’s blood must first pass our
trials. Our young friend Darknorth has done so, which means that we
are in compliance with the Autarch’s orders. Even if he wishes to
take the blood away, there’s nothing wrong with that,” the sea
dragon leader said. “But you three? If you also pass the trials, we
won’t interfere if you want to kill these two… but if you cannot,
we have no choice but to protect our young friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Emperor
Islehide spluttered furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just pass the
trials. Easy, right? Come one at a time and defeat both of our races,
that’s all you have to do,” the sea dragon leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen and the
others had ugly looks on their faces. Defeat the two races in
succession? Every single one of the flaming equines and sea dragons
had reached the Archon level, with the clan leaders being even
stronger. Only a true Hegemon would have a chance at surviving an
assault from so many of these creatures. Emperor Anchen had already
given it a try long ago, but he wasn’t even close to being able to
succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But we are the
Aeonians. This is our territory!” Emperor Anchen said furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, this is the
AUTARCH’S territory. The only thing we know and care about is the
Autarch’s command,” the sea dragon leader said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but… but that
omnigeddon bloodfruit tree belongs to our Aeonian race!” Emperor
Anchen said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! You were all
too weak and unable to make much use of the Autarch’s blood, which
was why you planted that omnigeddon bloodfruit tree here all those
years ago. Over the course of countless aeons, you have harvested
countless fruits from this tree… and the value of those fruits
vastly exceeded the value of the original tree itself.” The sea
dragon leader continued, “You’ve earned enough. Since our young
friend Darknorth has passed our trials, he gets to decide what to do
with the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, not you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But its ours! It
belongs to the Aeonians!” Emperor Islehide was growing anxious as
well. The omnigeddon bloodfruit tree had undergone a thorough
transformation. Even if it lost access to the Autarch’s blood, it
was still comparable in value to twelve ordinary trees. It truly was
a marvelous treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all… when it was able to absorb essence from the Autarch’s blood,
the unique fruits it gave birth to were more than ten times more
valuable than normal ones, making the tree close in value to
Crimsonwave Temple! The Aeonians absolutely viewed it as important as
life itself. Once they lost this tree, they’d have to wait millions
of chaos cycles before any new tree they planted over the blood would
have absorbed enough essence to transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But… in roughly a
million chaos cycles, the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels would destroy the
Endless Territories! There was no way they could rear a second tree.
This marvelous tree was literally one of a kind. They had already
started to accumulate fruits long ago, as once the Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels destroyed everything this entire world would probably be
devoured and destroyed as well. They would no longer have access to
any more fruits! In the final million chaos cycles, they were
planning to absorb as much of the essence from the Autarch’s blood
as they could… and they were even planning to shatter the tree
apart and drain the essence the tree had taken in from the Atuarch’s
blood.

Chapter 13 - Mortal Enemies
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The essence of the
Autarch’s blood would greatly benefit the Aeonian bloodlines of the
Aeonian race. To normal cultivators, this tree which Ji Ning had just
taken away was nothing more than a tree that would allow for
larger-than-normal harvests of fruit. To the Aeonians, however, the
Autarch’s blood essence within it was worth more than ten million
chaos cycles worth of fruit! It was something they absolutely could
not afford to lose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point talking too
much. Our young friend Darknorth has passed the trials, which means
we shall protect him. If you want to act against him, you can simply
attempt the trials as well,” the sea dragon leader said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to
fight, let’s start. Otherwise, hurry up and beat it,” the flaming
equine leader roared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen and the
others were enraged, but there was nothing they could do. Ning and
Ninedust both let out sighs of relief when they saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems there’s
nothing they can do to us,” Ninedust said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once we leave,
they’ll probably do everything they can to hunt us down,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endless
Territories are vast, while the Aeonians are mortal enemies of the
Dao Alliance! These three Emperors wouldn’t dare to act too
rashly.” Ninedust was quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Once they
left this place, they would be like wild geese disappearing into the
skies. Given that the two of them had access to the [Vitalis] art,
they could easily mimic the truesoul auras of others. They could
literally go anywhere they pleased; there was no need for them to
fear these three Emperors at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good… good!”
An utterly enraged laugh rang out, echoing in the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
raised their heads, surprised, to stare at the three leading Emperors
of the Aeonian race. The leader of the three, Emperor Anchen, was so
enraged he was laughing. He let out a furious growl, “If that’s
the case… estate-spirit, come out immediately!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A ripple of
power manifested, causing the light in the skies to coalesce into the
form of a white-haired woman with an extraordinary aura. An enigmatic
smile on her face, she asked, “What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spirit of the
estate?” Ning and Ninedust were both shocked. Suddenly, they
remembered that when they had been in the beastworld with the
Autarch’s Dao, that world held an estate-spirit within it. It
wasn’t unreasonable for this world to have an estate-spirit of its
own as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spirit of the
estate, this was a world for us created by our ancestor. These are
our ancestral lands! But these two outsider Daolords have not only
stolen away our omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, they even seek to steal
the Autarch’s blood. Please intervene and slay these two interloper
Daolords, estate-spirit!” Emperor Anchen said loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor?” Ning
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Anchen, did
you just say ‘ancestor’? Was this place created by Autarch
Bolin?” Ninedust called out loudly with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Emperor
Anchen glanced downwards, a hint of a cold smile on his lips. “The
members of the mighty Aeonian race are the descendants of Autarch
Bolin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both rather stunned. The descendants of Autarch Bolin? Were the
Aeonians really this incredible?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any member of the
Aeonian race who has been Awakened shall possess the bloodlines of
our almighty ancestor, Autarch Bolin!” Emperor Anchen said proudly,
“The Aeonian bloodline is special… because it is the bloodline of
an Autarch! This is a world which Autarch Bolin created for us; it is
our ancestral lands. The Autarch’s blood was left behind for us by
the Autarch as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both stunned. It made sense. The Aeonians did possess an incredible
bloodline; supposedly, after becoming Eternal Emperors they could use
their bloodline to slowly improve in power even further. It must be
understood that for most Emperors, improving in power was incredibly
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spirit of the
estate, you can go ahead and slay these two interlopers.” Emperor
Anchen looked anxiously at the estate-spirit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired woman
let out a cold snort. “I am unable to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unable to intervene?
How can you be unable to intervene?” Emperor Anchen was starting to
grow frantic. He knew just how powerful the estate-spirit was; within
this estate-world, the estate-spirit was virtually invincible! Even
Hegemons would probably be weaker than it in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must inform you
that this world was not, in fact, created for you Aeonians,” the
white-haired woman said. “During the Dawn War against the Sithe,
Autarch Bolin was worried about our side being defeated and so he
left behind many backup plans to help the cultivators rise to power
again in the future. He created this estate-world for that purpose,
and those three hundred-plus Hegemons willingly passed down their
legacies as well. This was all for the sake of the countless
cultivators who would be born in the future. It wasn’t just for you
Aeonians!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, we won
the war. Autarch Bolin’s life grew peaceful once more, but he
eventually grew lonely and so developed the Aeonian bloodline,
creating your Aeonian race. The Autarch left behind a single
undiluted drop of the original Aeonian blood in this place, hoping
that some of the many descendants of the Aeonian race would be able
to grow powerful enough to absorb it. Alas… this branch here in the
Flamedragon Realmverse is far too weak. Despite the passage of
countless years, none of you have been able to absorb this blood.”
The estate-spirit chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen, Emperor
Islehide, and Emperor Duug all felt rather ashamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you saying this
isn’t the Autarch’s blood?” the distant sea dragon leader
asked, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is the Autarch’s
blood, but it was formed after countless unique processes were
applied to it. This blood was part of the original blood which gave
birth to the Aeonian bloodlines and race, which was why I referred to
it as the ‘original Aeonian blood’,” the white-haired woman
said. “If any of the Aeonians were able to reach Hegemony, he would
more or less be able to absorb this drop of Aeonian blood. Once he
did so, he would finally and truly be qualified to refer to himself
as a true child of Autarch Bolin, and he would be far stronger than
ordinary Hegemons in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately…
this lot here is completely useless.” The white-haired woman shook
her head, then turned to look at the still-stunned Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you two? You
came into my estate-world using the Autarch’s medallion,” the
white-haired woman said. “This naturally counts as being here with
the Autarch’s commission. I won’t act against you two! However,
the Autarch’s blood was the font for the entire Aeonian race.
Ordinary cultivators like yourselves cannot absorb it, no matter how
hard you try. Also… Daolord Darknorth, there’s no need for you to
waste your efforts trying to move it. I am in control of this
estate-world, and I absolutely will not permit anyone to take it
away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If someone wishes to
take it away, the only method permissible is absorption… but only
Aeonians can accomplish it. Hegemon-level Aeonians, at that.” The
white-haired woman glanced sideways at Emperor Anchen. “You were
given every advantage in the world, but you made nothing of it. The
exalted Aeonians actually ended up having such useless progeny…
what a pity. Hmph.” As she spoke, she began to vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait! This
realmverse is about to be destroyed soon!” Emperor Anchen called
out frantically, “When that happens there will be no way for this
estate-world to exist by itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relax. An
estate-world which was laboriously created by Autarch Bolin will not
be so easily destroyed,” the white-haired woman said. “However…
when the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels destroy this area, this estate-world
shall vanish from it. The ties of destiny which link us together
shall have come to an end, and I will go search for a different
branch. Hmph… Autarch Bolin left behind many branches throughout
the vast Chaosverse, and many of those branches were given no chance
to absorb any of the Autarch’s blood. I gave you more than thirty
million chaos cycles, but you weren’t able to make the best of this
opportunity. Don’t blame anyone but yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen and the
others began to grow frantic. Become a Hegemon? Easier said than
done! There had been quite a few supreme Daolords in the history of
the Aeonian race in this realmverse, but their chances of succeeding
in the Daomerge were absolutely miniscule. Thus far, not a single one
of them had ever succeeded in the Daomerge and becoming a Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for existing
Emperors who were at the Archon level to reach the Hegemon level?
That was even harder. The Aeonians knew a great many things, but they
had only heard of a single Hegemon known as the ‘Paragon of Pills’
who had started off as an ordinary Eternal Emperor but then managed
to train all the way up to the Hegemon level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, the beastworld
we visited previously ended up flying away as well. It seems as
though this estate-world is also capable of independent movement,”
Ninedust sent mentally. “The Autarch’s blood truly is terrifying,
though… apparently, only Aeonian Hegemons are capable of absorbing
it. How powerful would they become upon doing so?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is what an
Autarch is capable of.” Ning stared at the swirling globe of blood
inside the massive crater. Its aura dwarfed that of any Hegemon; how
strong would one become after absorbing it? Alas, Autarch Bolin had
left it behind for the Aeonians alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what should we do
next?” Ninedust sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What can we do?
Since we cannot earn the Autarch’s blood, we might as well leave,”
Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
Emperor Anchen’s voice rang down from the skies above: “Daolord
Darknorth, Ninedust Sectlord… all you need to do is leave behind
the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree and swear a lifeblood oath not to
divulge any of those three hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies to
outsiders! If you are willing to do this, then the three of us would
also be willing to swear oaths to never attack or pursue you through
any means at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemonic
legacies? Haha, I’m a member of the Ancients! For the sake of all
these legacies, the Ancients would definitely do everything in their
power to protect me. Do you really think I’m afraid of you
Aeonians?” Ninedust snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
stare into the skies as well. If he eventually failed in his
Daomerge, these Hegemonic legacies were the most important thing he
could leave behind for the Three Realms in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, are you
going to reject our offer as well?” Emperor Anchen growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three
hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies were left behind for all cultivators,
not just you Aeonians. By what right do you demand an oath from us?”
Ning replied coldly. Not even the Hegemons themselves had demanded
Ning swear a lifeblood oath; what made the Aeonians think they had
that right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are courting
death.” The nearby Emperor Duug and Emperor Islehide were
infuriated as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen said
furiously, “This is your final warning. Hand over the omnigeddon
bloodfruit tree and swear the lifeblood oath! Otherwise, we Aeonians
will use everything at our disposal to hunt down and kill you two. We
won’t stop until you are dead!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning vanished into thin
air. As for Ninedust, he lifted the Autarch’s medallion up and
activated the power within it. A ripple of might surrounded him…
and a heartbeat later, he vanished without a trace, having left this
estate-world.

Chapter 14 - Secluded Meditation

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Anchen, Emperor
Duug, and Emperor Islehide were all stunned. They had just issued a
dire threat to pursue Darknorth and Ninedust until they were dead…
but they had left without even saying a word in response? This
attitude indicated that they truly felt no fear towards the Aeonians
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Estate-spirit, how
could they have just left like that? Did you let them out?” Emperor
Anchen turned to glare furiously at the distant white-haired woman.
When Aeonians wished to leave this estate-world, the estate-spirit
had to teleport them through spacetime out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired woman
said calmly, “I already stated that they came in via the Autarch’s
medallion. They left using the same method! It had nothing to do with
me at all. Besides, even if I did send them away I would at most be
able to send them to another world within the domain of the Aeonian
Kingdom! However, they used the Autarch’s medallion to flee far,
far away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Autarch’s
medallion?” Emperor Anchen and the others felt both enraged and
helpless. They had never heard of this medallion before, but the
estate-spirit’s words were beyond question. They couldn’t help
but sigh to themselves. Oh, Autarch… since you made this world, you
should’ve just left it to us, your children. Why did you have to
leave behind a medallion for outsiders to use?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, however…
Autarch Bolin had first created the medallions, and only then had
created the Aeonian race!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please send us out,”
Emperor Anchen said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” The
white-haired woman nodded. “You still have over one million chaos
cycles left. Your branch still has a chance at absorbing the
Autarch’s blood. When this realmverse is destroyed, it’ll be time
for me to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We understand,”
Emperor Anchen said, although in his heart he was unwilling to accept
this. Whoosh. The white-haired woman waved her arm, causing a
dimensional ripple to spread out and cover all three Emperors. They
were teleported through spacetime to the planet outside of this
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Emperors
reappeared within the ancient temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Emperor
Anchen closed his eyes, sending out an invisible ripple of power
which completely merged into every part of the Aeonian Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonian Kingdom
just informed me,” Emperor Anchen said as he opened his eyes, “That
no living beings have entered it via the first ancestral ground. It
seems as though the estate-spirit was right; Darknorth and Ninedust
have already teleported away to an extremely distant place thanks to
their Autarch’s medallion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never heard
of this medallion. They’re able to enter and exit our first
ancestral ground by using it?” The other two Emperors didn’t want
to accept this either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels are going to destroy the Flamedragon Realmverse soon. To
successfully absorb the Autarch’s blood in the next million or so
chaos cycles… our chances are quite low,” Emperor Anchen said.
“We’ve harvested many fruits over the years, but we’ve used up
many of them to help rear all of those Daolords. We absolutely have
to acquire the large amount of Autarch’s blood essence which was
distilled into the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The other
two Emperors nodded as well. The Autarch’s blood was the wellspring
for the Aeonian bloodline, and the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree had
drawn upon the essence of that blood for over thirty million chaos
cycles. This had caused the tree to undergo a fundamental
transformation. When they fully absorbed all of the essence within
it, it would be of tremendous benefit to them. This mattered to the
Aeonians more than anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Duug,” Emperor
Anchen commanded, “Immediately mobilize all the forces we have
available to find as much information as we can regarding Daolord
Darknorth and the Ninedust Sectlord. Once we find any trace of them,
move to kill them and take that tree back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Emperor
Duug said seriously, “I’ll oversee this matter personally!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Islehide,” Emperor
Anchen instructed, “You’ve made quite a few friends amongst the
Emperors of the various races. Come up with a way to convince them to
help us track down Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Emperor Islehide nodded. Although the Aeonians and the Dao Alliance
were mortal enemies, the Aeonians were still the weakest of the six
powers. The Brightshore Kingdom, the Aberrants, and the Ancient
cultivators each had a Hegemon, while the Dark Kingdom consisted of
many cultivators from another realmverse who had all gathered
together, allowing them to survive despite being ostracized by all
five of the other organizations. This was a testament to how deep the
Dark Kingdom’s foundation was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage, Daolord
Skyshatter, Daolord Owlblack… they all belonged to the Dark
Kingdom. The number of elite Daolords they had was another testament
to their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Dao
Alliance? That went without saying. 99% of the Endless Territories
was under their control, and they had countless Daolords and many
publicly acknowledged Emperors, with even more being in seclusion.
The Dao Alliance didn’t care about the other powers at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aeonians were
different. At the top end, they had no Hegemonic cultivators. In
terms of raw numbers, they had very few people! It was all thanks to
the Aeonian Kingdom that they hadn’t been wiped out. But of course,
if a particularly incredible figure arose within their ranks who
succeeded in the Daomerge and became a Hegemon, that person could
absorb the Autarch’s blood and vault the entire Aeonian race to
become the pre-eminent power in the Flamedragon Realmverse. Alas, the
Aeonians had never been able to produce a Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, the
Aeonians were the weakest of the six major powers… and the enmity
between them and the Dao Alliance was deep and unabiding. As a
result, the high-level Aeonians did their best to try and befriend
high-level members of the Dao Alliance, trading them treasures and so
forth. This was one of the reasons why the Dao Alliance hadn’t
declared an all-out war against the Aeonian race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the high-level
members of the Dao Alliance held a certain belief; they viewed the
existence of the Aeonians as a good way to help temper the countless
Daolords under their rule.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Islehide was
the primary point of contact for making friends with the Emperors of
the other races and organizations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Legacies from over
three hundred Hegemons, and the essence of the omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree! Both things are supremely important to our Aeonian race.”
Emperor Anchen’s eyes flashed with sharp light. “From this day
forth, Darknorth and Ninedust shall be the greatest enemies of the
Aeonian race. We have to find them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t let them
escape,” Emperor Duug said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sooner or later,
they’ll fall into our hands.” Emperor Islehide narrowed his eyes
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ninedust
appeared out of nowhere within an empty patch of space which was
incredibly far away from the Aeonian Kingdom. He then waved his hand,
allowing Ning to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack. The medallion in
Ninedust’s hand began to break apart. “The power’s been used
up.” Ninedust shook his head helplessly. “A pity. Even if we
weren’t able to use it to re-enter the Aeonian Kingdom, it still
would’ve been an excellent escape mechanism. It’s gone now
though.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it is indeed an
incredible treasure for escape. Not even a host of Hegemons would be
able to stop it,” Ning said. “And it really does allow one to
teleport quite a long distance through spacetime.” If Ning had to
rely on his own powers to traverse spacetime, it would probably take
him half a year to travel such a great distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what are
you planning to do next?” Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve really won
quite a few things for ourselves,” Ning said with a laugh. “Those
three hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies are particularly important! The
Aeonians are going to go all-out in searching for us, be it for the
sake of those legacies or for the sake of that omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree. In the end, they are still one of the six top organizations in
the Endless Territories, and they’ve been around for a very long
time. They’ll probably have quite a few methods they can use to
search for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
nodded solemnly as well. “Right. We have to be careful. We
shouldn’t tell anyone at all where we are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed: “Only
the two of us can know where we are. We can’t tell anyone at all.
As for those legacies… we didn’t have enough time in the
estate-world to really meditate on them properly. We should find a
suitable place to go into seclusion and train.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Ninedust laughed. “I also feel that we need more time to train.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two quickly
departed. After traveling for another ten-plus years they were deep
within the Dao Alliance’s territory, at which point they chose a
planet to go into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s pick that
planet.” Swoosh. Swoosh. Ning and Ninedust descended upon the
surface of that planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clouds, come!”
Ninedust stood at the top of that planet, letting out a loud shout.
Instantly, a thick layer of clouds began to manifest over the planet,
with a series of runic seals beginning to appear within the clouds.
This separated them from the outside world, creating an independent
local realm. Ning and Ninedust wanted to avoid their auras from
leaking outsides. Powerful World-level cultivators and Daolords would
often do something similar when they established an estate within a
particular planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone, one of the
planets Ning had visited when he had first entered the Badlands
Territory, was a good example.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rain, descend!”
Ninedust let out another loud shout. Instantly, a large amount of
rain began to cascade downwards. Soon, lakes and even oceans began to
form atop the formerly parched planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning and
Ninedust’s abilities, it took them just three days to completely
transform this planet. It now had an atmosphere, clouds, lakes,
oceans, countless types of vegetation, and even some simple insects
and bugs were beginning to take form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ninedust
waved his hand, instantly causing some of the living beings he
carried within his estate-realm to emerge into this new world. This
included tens of thousands of ordinary humans, as well as many types
of animals, fish, and birds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, this planet truly
was suitable for them to reside within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We didn’t spend
enough time within the Autarch’s estate-world; we didn’t really
analyze many of those Hegemonic techniques in detail.” Ninedust
said eagerly, “After we do so, we might make great gains. Perhaps
my chances at the Daomerge can be improve even further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I might be able to
make some breakthroughs as well once I meditate on these Hegemonic
legacies.” Ning was stuck at the final step and had been unable to
break through to the last stage. Once he did, he would become a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, at which point he truly would be able to
roam the Endless Territories with impunity. Most likely, only the
three mighty Hegemons would be stronger than him… but that final
step was incredibly hard to take.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were now being
pursued by the Aeonians. As a result, they decided to thoroughly
study all of the three hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies and entered
secluded meditation.

Chapter 15 - The Modern Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shortly after Ji Ning
entered secluded meditation, he received word that his master
Patriarch Subhuti had returned to the Three Realms alongside
Windfiend. The two were planning to break through to the Samsara
Daolord level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms.
Serpentwing Lake. Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning,
Subhuti, and Windfiend were seated close to each other, drinking wine
and chatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Windfiend
and I have spent hundreds of millions of years wandering the outside
world. We have benefited greatly from our experiences and feel that
it is time for us to break through to become Samsara Daolords,”
Subhuti said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha… we’ve
wandered the Badlands Territory and even a number of the nearby
territories. I don’t want to brag, but it is quite hard for us to
find any World-level cultivators who are our equals.” Windfiend
seemed quite smug as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
surprised. “Windfiend, Master… can the two of you give me a
demonstration and show me the level you have reached?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
Windfiend smiled as a series of additional Windfiends began to appear
in the area around them. Dozens of them appeared, all with different
expressions and postures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
nodded slowly. “For you to have reached such a level in the Dao of
Wind… you must have mastered a Supreme Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now watch Master’s
abilities.” Subhuti put down his wine cup. Instantly, spacetime in
the surrounding area abegan to ripple. Space itself seemed to
transform as though this area was severed from the rest of the
universe, and the speed of time began to change as well. It was like
the three of them were aboard a small vessel, with the outside world
being a river of spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given Master’s
mastery over the Dao of Spacetime, he probably mastered a Supreme Dao
as well.” Ning was rather stunned. It must be remembered that he
had only left quite ordinary techniques to the Three Realms in the
past. Those were all techniques he had acquired from Vastheaven
Palace, and there was nothing particularly impressive. For example,
there were no Hegemonic legacies! How was it that his master and
Windfiend had both mastered a Supreme Dao each?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Ning had only gained his Omega Sword Dao thanks to his
experiences in Vastheaven Palace, in the Archaeus Region, and many
other places. If it hadn’t been for all of those things, he
probably would be just slightly superior to Subhuti and Windfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master and Windfiend
truly are monstrously talented,” Ning sighed secretly in amazement.
In truth, all of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realm were
freakishly talented. Originally, they had no legacies at all… but
they had managed to develop their own incredible techniques. Three
Purities, Tathagata, the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, Houyi, Subhuti…
they had all developed techniques that allowed them to fight those at
a higher level, which meant that they vastly surpassed those on the
same level in terms of insight into the Dao. Even the slightly weaker
ones like Sun Wukong, Daoist Jade Cauldron, or Maitreya were still at
a higher level of enlightenment than those in the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, Master…
do not be in a rush to break through just yet,” Ning said solemnly.
“I have just left a few truly top-tier techniques within the Three
Realms Archives! Go and check them out first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly top-tier
techniques?” Subhuti and Windfiend were both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The techniques you
gave us previously were already quite good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there even
better ones now?” The two both looked at Ning. The two were
incredibly talented, and as soon as they reached the World level they
immediately reached a level of power where very few of their peers
were able to defeat them. However, their experiences simply weren’t
as incredible as Ning, nor did they have as many fortuitous
encounters. Thankfully, Ning had gifted the Three Realms with many
techniques; otherwise, their talents would’ve gone to waste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know once
you go take a look,” Ning said with a laugh. He didn’t explain in
detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll go take a
look first.” Both of them were deeply intrigued by Ning’s
secretive attitude, and they both hurried over to the Three Realms
Archives to take a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The new additions Ning
had just added into the Three Realms Archives… included the
World-level parts of the Hegemonic legacies which Ning had gained!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as his
master Subhuti and Windfiend departed. His body flickered. Whoosh! He
arrived in the void outside the Three Realms, where he stood by
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More and more, I’m
beginning to get the feeling that the Three Realms is an
extraordinary place.” Ning stared at the many spread-out planets in
the Three Realms, including the three thousand major worlds and the
trillions of minor worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I was out
adventuring through the outside world, I began to understand how
unique the Three Realms are… but I didn’t realize just how
amazing it was. After a few hundred million years, though… the
Three Realms have completely changed,” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had
undergone a gradual transformation, which was why Ning hadn’t
noticed anything at first. After hundreds of millions of years,
however, the difference was quite drastic and apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many years ago the most
dazzling figures of the earlier eras, such as Daoist Three Purities,
the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Houyi,
and Demonheart had all perished in battle. The survivors who were on
par with them, Subhuti and Windfiend, were now close to becoming
Samsara Daolords… and extraordinary ones at that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the many elite
figures like Sun Wukong, Buddha Maitreya, or Yang Jie? After hundreds
of millions of years of cultivation, they had all broken through to
the World level as well. Even Brightmoon had improved! Although she
wasn’t quite that talented, she had still been able to break
through to become a Celestial Immortal thanks to her own efforts.
Under Ning’s guidance, she had actually reached the Elder God
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What’s more… the
success rates for Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms
breaking through to become Celestial Immortals was skyrocketing!
Although some would fail and become Loose Immortals, many would
reincarnate and eventually succeed in becoming Celestial Immortals.
Only a small percentage were unlucky enough to actually perish to the
Celestial Tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The change was
all-encompassing. Celestial Immortals, True Immortals, Ancestral
Immortals, Chaos Immortals… after the Three Realms gained so many
legacies, the breakthrough rates at every single level had
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the
Three Realms is much talented than in the outside world,” Ning
sighed. “The same was true for the Seamless Chaosworld. The
Immortals and Fiendgods from the Seamless Chaosworld were on par with
that of the Pangu Chaosworld.” Ning grew increasingly curious.
“What made them so special?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning was
definitely one of the major powers in the Endless Territories. He had
reached the Archon level of power, and thus had a much broader vision
than many. He knew that there were some chaosworlds, including the
ones which Hegemons had labored over or ones like the Sithe worlds,
which were quite special and which gave birth to living beings who
were noticeably more talented than those in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What made the Three
Realms so special?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps it has
something to do with the Azureflower Estate,” Ning mused. He then
shook his head and chuckled. Only with enough strength could one act
with confidence. Only when he took the final step and became a
Daolord of the Fourth Step would he have reached the apex. When that
happened, in all the Flamedragon Realmverse the only ones more
powerful than him would be the three Hegemons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windfiend had been the
Lord of All Fiends of the Three Realms, the supreme leader of the
Seamless Gate. He was the fastest person in all the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was a master of
the Dao of Spacetime. His mastery of it had been supreme within the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two were
exceedingly talented figures. After studying the World-level parts of
the Hegemonic legacies, they immediately began to seek to merge
multiple Supreme Daos together!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training for 120
million years (which translated into 10 billion ‘accelerated’
years within his temporal acceleration treasure), Windfiend finally
managed to merge three Supreme Daos together… and he broke through
to become a Samsara Daolord at one go!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was a bit
slower. He had to train for over 300 million years, also using a
temporal acceleration treasure. Finally, he also succeeded in merging
multiple Supreme Daos and became a Samsara Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course… only
the two of them reached such heights. The other Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Three Realm were a bit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, Master…
these legacies are critically important. I shall personally watch
over these legacies, and anyone who wishes to study them must swear
lifeblood oaths. If I perish, I will entrust them to you and
Windfiend to watch over,” Ning said solemnly. These were the copies
of the hundreds of Hegemonic legacies, and his Primaltwin had spent
an extremely long period of time memorizing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These legacies…”
Subhuti and Windfiend were absolutely stunned by the enormous
repository of legacies in front of them. These legacies were of
limited use to Ning, who trained in the Omega Sword Dao, but they
would be of tremendous use to all other cultivators. This was far
more valuable than anything Ning had acquired in the Brightshore
Kingdom or the Archaeus Region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The existences of
these legacies cannot be divulged in the slightest.” Subhuti looked
at Ning, his heart aching for his disciple. “Disciple, don’t put
yourself under too much pressure when adventuring. Take things
slowly, one step at a time. You’ve already done enough for the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, be
careful when out adventuring. Subhuti and I are still too weak; the
Three Realms needs you standing guard over it,” Windfiend said.
After seeing the legacies, he understood just how weak he was. He was
still just a Daolord of the First Step; in the Endless Territories,
he counted for absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of Ning’s loved
ones were in the Three Realms. His father, Ji Yichuan… his mother,
Yuchi Snow… his daughter, Ji Brightmoon… Subhuti, Uncle White,
Little Qing, Immortal Diancai, Mu Northson, Sun Wukong, and more were
all here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was often
adventuring with the hope of reversing the flows of spacetime and
reviving his wife, he also cared tremendously about his other loved
ones. Only if he could absolutely ensure their safety would he be
able to truly lay rest to his concerns and go out adventuring!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon.” A
black-robed Ning was standing on the surface of Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” The
white-robed Brightmoon was standing on the surface of the lake as
well. Her life truly was relaxed and leisurely; with a peerless
master of the Dao of the Sword like Ji Ning being her tutor and
guide, everything was so simple. In fact, Ning even occasionally
arranged for her to go out and explore the Badlands Territory. Given
Ning’s current level of power, a single step was all it took for
them to reach the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me see if your
sword-arts have improved or not,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Father.”
Brightmoon smiled, followed by her sword-light lighting up. A total
of 3600 Immortal swords hung in the air around her. This was a
terrifyingly powerful sword-formation technique which Ning had passed
down to her. For some reason, Brightmoon simply had no talent for
training as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and so she was focused on being
a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Sword-light
covered the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to spar
against his daughter. He had been at the side of his daughter and his
parents for hundreds of millions of years now. He had always dreamed
of having Yu Wei by their side one day as well, accompanying him and
watching as he taught their daughter swordplay. If that day ever
came, he truly would be able to die with no regrets.

Ning’s true body, however, continued to fearless advance and

have reached such a terrifying level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A young man and a woman
were standing at the prow of a large ship that was cruising through
the waves of a vast sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you’ve grown much more powerful and have
reached the Foundation stage. You’ll definitely be ranked in the
top three within our clan’s tournament. In fact, you might even
take first place!” the green-robed woman said excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was able to reach
the Foundation stage, but the others might have made breakthroughs of
their own. The clan competition will have three thousand disciples
competing within it. Seizing first place is not going to be an easy
task,” the black-robed youth said. His words were modest, but a
hint of a smile was playing at his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly had made
tremendous gains this time. He had no idea who that old fisherman
was, but the man was incredibly powerful. That casual finger-wave had
contained unfathomably profundity within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
stroked his chest, where an ordinary-looking little rock was hanging
from a necklace. The old fisherman had given it to him, and it
contained an extremely profound set of staff-arts within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The clan
competition? At my current level of power, the clan competition is
nothing. My level of comprehension has skyrocketed so much that I
should be able to break through to the Core Formation stage with
ease.” The black-robed youth’s eyes gleamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, within a
flying ship that was hidden in the mists above the world. Ji Ning and
Ninedust were seated aboard this ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An old fisherman?
Really? Ninedust, you aren’t exactly handsome, but there was no
need for you to transform yourself into a rheumy-eyed, white-haired
old man,” Ning said with a laugh. “And you went out of your way
to give that mortal some guidance. What, is he very talented? Why
didn’t I notice it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s decent for a
mortal, but to people like us he truly is nothing special.”
Ninedust sighed. “But… when I saw him, I felt as though I saw
myself from long ago. That’s why I decided to guide him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Ninedust was a very arrogant and solitary person who killed without
blinking and was unscrupulous when pursuing his goals. However, he
was willing to risk his own life to aid those he viewed as friends.
That young mortal youth was similarly a solitary and lonely figure,
but he was just as willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of
that junior apprentice-sister of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a lucky kid,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You and I remade
this world when we chose to set up our estate here, bringing
countless living beings into existence,” Ninedust said smugly.
“Thus, we are responsible for guiding and teaching them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You? Guide and
teach?” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The living beings on
this world had already gone through the earliest barbarian days,
discovered primitive cultivation techniques, experienced a dazzling
golden age, suffered through a great apocalypse, and finally entered
the current, fairly stable era. Ning truly did work attentively to
guide this world… but Ninedust? He was a much harder-hearted figure
than Ning. He didn’t give a damn about whether the living beings
here lived or died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust occasionally
taught some people, but it was strictly due to sudden spurts of
interest. For example, just now he transformed into a fisherman and
transmitted a set of staff-arts to the kid, then tossed him a stone.
That was it! He didn’t even teach the kid an actual cultivation
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and
Ninedust’s faces suddenly tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
barked. Whoosh! The flying vessel disappeared as Ning and Ninedust
instantly departed from this planet and arrived in the void beyond
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Why are the realmship fragments we found in the Sithe ruins
resonating?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mine is resonating
as well. My realmship fragment is trembling right now, as though it
wants to fly in a certain direction.” Ninedust pointed towards a
direction which led into the chaotic void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two each had part
of the shattered realmship. Both of those parts were shaking right
now, wanting to go flying off in a certain direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s
wrong,” Ning said. “When we scavenged the realmship wreckage in
the Sithe ruins, we each collected a fairly undamaged piece. There’s
never been a resonance like this before! Now that there is a sudden
resonance… it has to have something to do with the Sithe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shall we go take a
look?” Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go take
a look.” Ning nodded. Both of them were bold due to their power.
This thing which was resonating with their realmship fragments could
very well be a great fortune! Realmships were treasures which even
Hegemons would go wild over, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Ninedust in
tearing through spacetime and advancing. “Wait, something’s
wrong.” As soon as they exited the spacetime tear, Ning’s face
tightened. “I can sense that the distance between us and the
resonance is rapidly decreasing. They’re moving towards us as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they are headed
in our direction.” Ninedust’s face turned grim as well. For the
resonance to grow stronger and stronger meant that the distance was
clearly decreasing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A skinny man with white
eyebrows and deep green eyes was standing within the chaotic void. He
was dressed in long white robes and had white hair. His oily green
eyes emanated an insidious coldness that was more than enough to
inspire terror in the hearts of other cultivators. He was one of the
most awe-inspiring members of the Dao Alliance, one of the eight
Archons of the Sacred Cities… Archon Silksnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silksnow… this
sounded like a woman’s Daoist title, but he was indeed a man.
Archon Silksnow was an extremely evil individual. Comparing Sectlord
Timedream to him was like comparing an innocent baby with a demon who
had mass-murdered over a trillion people!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
legends, Archon Silksnow had been born within a great apocalypse
where countless living beings had died. As a rain of blood fell from
the skies, an infant came crawling out of the torn-open belly of his
deceased mother. The child was savage and bloodthirsty by nature, and
he was inconceivably talented when it came to cultivation. His path
of cultivation was one of slaughter and an endless sea of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody could stop him!
Nobody! He actually trained all the way up at one go, succeeding in
his Daomerge and becoming one of the eight Archons of the Sacred
Cities! He was definitely a dominating and overwhelmingly powerful
figure, and the countless bloodthirsty, violent cultivators of the
Endless Territories all submitted to his rule. In fact, there were
quite a few extremely violent Emperors who chose to follow him! In
the Dao Alliance, he was ranked third amongst the eight Archons of
the Sacred Cities! He was one of the truly terrifying figures of the
Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Archon
Silksnow stared towards a certain direction with his oily green eyes.
“It’s coming from over there! My realmship is resonating
powerfully with something in that direction.” An excited look
flashed through Archon Silksnow’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master! It’s
another part of a realmship. It’s another part!” The
vessel-spirit of his tattered realmship was extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Archon
Silksnow’s white eyebrows fluttered. “I’ll take it for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Endless
Territories, the only ones Archon Silksnow feared were the three
mighty Hegemons. He held no fear towards any of the other experts at
all. It must be remembered that he had slaughtered his way to
becoming a dominating figure. How could he possibly fear others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! A streak of
snow-white saber light tore through spacetime. Archon Silksnow
stepped into the tunnel, traversing through spacetime towards the
direction of the resonance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s moving closer
to us… and it’s moving incredibly fast. Much faster than me when
I tear through spacetime!” Ning turned pale. “Ninedust, we need
to leave immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even faster than
you?” Ninedust was startled as well. The difference in speed at
which one tore through the void in order to travel was a testament to
a difference in insight. Ning immediately led Ninedust in a frantic
retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are starting to
run?” Archon Silksnow gently stroked his long, droopy white
eyebrows. “They won’t be able to flee.” He continued to tear
through spacetime in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fled at full
speed, wanting to flee somewhere safe such as the Brightshore Kingdom
or one of the Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too fast. We
won’t be able to make it.” Ning gritted his teeth. “It seems
our only choice is to pick a battlefield to fight him head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, set up
your formations right away,” Ning sent. “We need to pick the
battlefield, then set up formations and await his arrival.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ninedust
nodded. Judging from how fast the person was, that person should’ve
reached a higher level of enlightenment than Ning. How strong he
actually was, however, would only be determined through actual
combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Focus.” Ninedust
immediately tossed out a black globe. As the black globe flew out, it
quickly flew towards a distant, desolate planet. It merged itself
into the planet, causing a layer of black light to appear on the
planet’s surface. Countless runes could be seen flickering over the
surface of the black light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide,” Ninedust
growled. The countless black runes all turned reserved and stately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning produced a
treasure as well. This was a treasure he had acquired from the Sithe
ruins, a deep blue necklace that looked broken. Ning tossed it out,
and it immediately flew towards that planet and merged into its
depths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
flew towards that planet and landed on its surface. They only had
enough time to set up three layers of defenses before they sensed a
powerful aura appear off in the distance. A white-robed,
white-haired, white-browed man tore straight through the void and
appeared before them, his eyebrows fluttering in the astral wind. He
turned to stare in their direction with his oily green eyes. Although
he was very thin, Ning and Ninedust didn’t feel that he was small
at all; they only felt an utterly terrifying and dominating aura
spread out towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archon Silksnow!”
Ning and Ninedust both turned pale. They never would’ve imagined
that their opponent was the most savage and brutal of the eight lords
of the Sacred Cities… Archon Silksnow!

Chapter 17 - Negotiations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow’s
eyebrows fluttered, a look of surprise flashing through his oily
green eyes. He then let out a cold chuckle: “You fled quite fast. I
had thought that it was an Emperor… who would’ve thought it was
you two kids?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Archon
Silksnow,” Ji Ning and Ninedust both bowed modestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Archon
Silksnow let out a cold snort. Instantly, a blurry aura of light
appeared which covered an area of ten billion kilometers. Spacetime
in this region was completely severed from the outside world. This
caused Ning and Ninedust to turn pale. Archon Silksnow then made his
move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. He suddenly
charged downwards, leaving a streak of light behind in the skies as
he arced downwards like curved saber-light. An aura of supreme
coldness pierced towards them, seeming to penetrate their souls and
truesouls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was simply too fast.
This strike was the fastest saber-strike Ning had ever seen, so fast
that Ning felt a sense of panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was also too cold.
The saber-intent from this strike caused Ning’s very truesoul to
shiver from the cold. This was the level which a true lord of the
Sacred Cities was at! The golems Ning had previously encountered, as
well as the flaming beasts and sea dragons he had encountered in the
estate-world, were extremely strong and extremely fast but much
inferior when it came to actual insights into the mysteries of the
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of insight and
understanding, this Archon Silksnow definitely surpassed Ning in
every regard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning and
Ninedust were both shocked. They didn’t expect for Archon Silksnow
to almost immediately attack after saying just a few words. Clearly,
he wanted to take their lives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
manifested three heads and six arms, drawing all six Northbow swords
and executing his Omega Sword Dao - Soleheart in a full-power
defense. Faced with such a terrifying strike, Ning didn’t even
think about counter-attacking. His only thought was to hold and
defend first! Three of his swords just barely managed to intercept
the saber-light, and as they did a surge of cold energy seemed to
slam into and through him like a giant hammer, crushing him with its
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning was
immediately knocked flying backwards. He slammed into the ground of
the planet, causing the planet to shudder and enormous crevices and
gorges to appear on its surface which were hundreds of kilometers
long. The planet now looked like a cracked turtle shell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too
powerful.” Ninedust didn’t even dare to block, instead
transforming into a wave of water which frantically retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Archon Silksnow
used the saber in his left hand to strike at Ning. As for the saber
in his right hand, he hacked at Ninedust with it. Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast stream of
water that was Ninedust was cut in half from the very center, and a
low growl could be heard emanating from within it. Moments later, the
two streams of water quickly began to flee. Only when they fled next
to Ning did they reform into a single fleshly body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had flown out of
the gorge. He stood alongside Ninedust, ugly looks on their faces.
“I’ve already reached the Archon level, but I never imagined that
the difference between me and an actual Archon of a Sacred City would
be so great.” Ning’s heart was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too powerful. He’s
too powerful. My invulnerable aquaform has been highly perfected, but
he was still able to heavily injure me with one blow.” Ninedust’s
face was rather ashen. He sent mentally, “Darknorth, this Archon
Silksnow is too powerful. He’d probably be able to kill me in just
ten or so blows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
Invulnerable forms weren’t truly invincible! When Emperor Solesky
had been a Daolord, he had been heavily injured by Fiendqueen
Dustrain. If an enemy was at a sufficiently high level of power, not
even an invulnerable form could completely nullify the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. Daolord
Darknorth… no wonder you rose to pre-eminence in the Waveshift
Realm.” Archon Silksnow stared at Ning with his oily green eyes.
“Your friend, the Ninedust Sectlord, has an invulnerable aquaform,
but I was able to injure him heavily. You, however… you weren’t
injured by my strike at all. Haha… given your level of power, you
should’ve reached the Archon level by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… you are
still far from being a match for me.” Archon Silksnow smiled a
cold, blood-curdling smile. “I’ve always had the habit of
striking with full power when I attack, even if my target is a
Daolord. The two of you can die now.” Archon Silksnow suddenly
manifested a total of six arms, with each arm gripping a saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait!” Ninedust
called loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Archon
Silksnow looked coldly at Ning and Ninedust. “Is there something
which the two of you wish to say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archon Silksnow, we
are just Daolords; there’s no way we can match an Archon like
yourself. If there’s something you want, you can just tell us,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Archon. If
there’s something you want, we can negotiate,” Ninedust agreed
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the two had
set up quite a few formations on this planet, they still weren’t
confident in their chances. They had quite a few treasures, yes…
but would the most savage of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities,
Archon Silksnow, possibly have fewer treasures than them? He probably
had more than ten times as many as they did! Even worse, their
earlier clash had already shown Ning and Ninedust how huge the power
gap between them was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust would probably
be slain within just ten strikes! As for Ning? He knew just how big
the gap between him and his foe was. Archon Silksnow was highly
ranked even for one of the lords of the Sacred Cities, and he was
incredibly powerful. He had also been alive for an extremely long
period of time. Although he didn’t have a Universe treasure, he did
have lifeblood weapons! Those lifeblood weapons had grown over the
course of many years to become just as powerful as Ning’s Northbow
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t even have
an advantage in weaponry! As for insight into the Dao? He was
superior to supreme Daolords, yes, but there was a clear difference
between him and the Archons! That saber-strike from earlier… it was
superior to Ning’s sword-arts in every single aspect. Ning’s
Soleheart stance was able to mitigate some of his disadvantages, but
the difference in power was still great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was so great that Ning might not be able to escape even if he used up
his treasures. It really wasn’t worth it for him to risk and
sacrifice so much just for a battered piece of a realmship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
stared at the blurry glow surrounding them for ten billion
kilometers. Archon Silksnow had immediately used a treasure to block
out the surrounding spacetime continuum; from this, they could tell
how determined Archon Silksnow was. He was definitely going to
acquire the realmship parts, no matter what the cost! Ning could also
sense that his sword-arts were no longer capable of tearing through
spacetime. If he used the Hegemon’s spacetime disc, he might be
able to succeed… but he also might fail in his attempt to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His foe was a lord of
the Sacred Cities, after all! Ning truly wasn’t confident in his
chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Negotiate? You wish
to negotiate with me?” Archon Silksnow stared downwards at Ning and
Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, negotiate.”
Ninedust said hurriedly, “Archon, you probably came for the sake of
our realmship parts, right? To tell you the truth, we brothers sensed
the resonance as well. That’s why we immediately fled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s
anything you wish from us, Archon, just tell us,” Ning said. Faced
with such a legendary tyrant, they had no choice but to lower their
heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow’s
most famous action came during a gathering of Emperors in the Dao
Alliance’s Palace of Immortals. Archon Silksnow ended up being
angered by a dispute caused by clashing interests with the other
Emperors! He had suppressed his rage when still inside the Palace,
but after they all left he actually consecutively killed the twelve
Eternal Emperors who had offended him. This was something which had
rendered everyone in the Endless Territories completely speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To occasionally kill a
few enemy Emperors due to personal feuds was one thing… but to kill
twelve of them because of a fit of pique? This was absolutely crazy!
This was why he was famous for being the most savage and bloodthirsty
of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. He was a madman! He was also
incredibly strong and had many trump cards ready to play. He had
offended and angered many with his actions, and had incurred the
displeasure of the other Archons as well. As a result, there had been
a great battle which had spanned multiple chaos cycles and resulted
in innumerable casualties, but in the end the matter was simply
dropped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmship?” Archon
Silksnow glanced at them, a not-quite smile playing at his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us would
naturally keep this information completely secret,” Ninedust said
hurriedly. “We are willing to swear oaths that we will definitely
keep this secret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two are quite
clever. When you sensed how fast I was moving towards you, you
immediately chose to flee.” Archon Silksnow glanced at Ning.
“Daolord Darknorth is extremely powerful; if I was just slightly
weaker, I probably wouldn’t be able to do anything to him. However…
the difference in power between us is too great for you to overcome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow nodded.
“Since you are willing to bow your heads, I’ll give you a way to
survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
looked at Archon Silksnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, you must give
me all of your treasures, save for your weapons and your armor,”
Archon Silksnow said. “Second, you are not to resist and must allow
me to read through your memories and your soul. Don’t worry, I’ll
swear an oath not to harm your souls or truesouls in the slightest; I
simply wish to scan them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
turned grim. Ninedust said angrily, “Archon, don’t go too far.”
Ning’s face turned as cold as ice as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scan their memories?
The two were incredibly proud figures. How could they be willing to
allow others to rifle through their memories? Ning wasn’t willing
to hand over all of his treasures either. The omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree and the verdant azuresoul were both incredibly precious
treasures. The latter had been personally fashioned by Autarch Bolin
and was capable of controlling a Chaos Primordial!

Chapter 18 - Spacetime Disc
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Once I kill
you, I’ll still end up with your treasures,” Archon Silksnow said
coldly. “I’m at least willing to let you keep your weapons and
your armor; this is an unusual display of mercy from me. As for
searching through your memories… I merely wish to learn where you
acquired the realmship parts from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realmships were relics
created by the Sithe. Since Ji Ning and Ninedust had somehow acquired
realmship parts, Archon Silksnow felt certain that they must have
visited Sithe ruins . Every single Sithe ruins was akin to a treasure
trove; Archon Silksnow naturally wished to learn everything he could
above such a place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Search through my
memories? I’d choose death over that,” Ninedust said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archon, we can give
you the realmship parts! We can also swear to keep it all a secret,”
Ning said coldly. “If you accept, we’ll hand over the parts right
away. If you refuse… our only choice will be to do battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…”
Archon Silksnow raised his head and began to laugh loudly, his
laughter echoing throughout the sealed region of ten billion
kilometers. “You dare to try and haggle with ME?” A savage,
murderous look appeared in his oily green eyes: “Then die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streams of
dazzling, enormous saber-light chopped downwards towards Ning and
Ninedust like curved moons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this.”
Ning and Ninedust exchanged a glance, no longer hesitating at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” Ninedust
growled. Instantly, a layer of black light filled with countless
flickering runes erupted on the surface of the planet. Space in the
area around the planet seemed to have been completely frozen, causing
the six curved streaks of saber-light to slow down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later,
blood-colored formation-flags appeared throughout the planet, causing
it to descend into a sea of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, a series of
roaring beast phantoms appeared. A total of nineteen beast phantoms
charged straight towards Archon Silksnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning
activated the treasures he had set down as well. Clank clank clank! A
series of deep blue chains appeared out of nowhere behind Archon
Silksnow, coiling towards him in an attempt to bind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive formation
appeared as well, transforming the skies into an enormous white
chessboard. Directly below the planet, an enormous black chessboard
appeared within the void. These two giant chessboards slowly
swiveled, causing endless streams of light to connect them together
in a cage around Archon Silksnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Boom! Dark-gold
lightning flickered and crashed downwards towards Archon Silksnow as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few
treasures.” Archon Silksnow smiled coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust truly
were being quite cautious. They had set up treasures and formations
of tremendous power. Although Archon Silksnow was extremely strong,
these things would still tie him down for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!!!” Archon
Silksnow let out a savage laugh as a golden disc flew out of his
body. The disc rose vertically, its edges incredibly sharp. It
emanated a ripple of terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiiiiiiiiiiing! The
disc emanated an ear-piercing sound that caused the hearts of Ning
and Ninedust to tremble. It suddenly expanded in size, becoming
almost as large as the planet itself as it spun in a chopping manner
at the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Archon Silksnow
wielded a warblade in each of his six harms, effortlessly blocking
the deep blue chains that were coiling towards him from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The giant
spinning disc was able to forcibly cut through everything in its
path, breaking through all of the various formations! It must be
remembered that even Archon Silksnow would have been able to spend
quite some time and energy breaking through these formations if he
was relying on his own power. Now, however, he used the disc to blow
through them like rotting deadwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the formations
atop the giant planet were instantly destroyed, and even the planet
itself was chopped in half before the remaining power of the disc was
used up. Finally, the disc crumbled apart and dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both rather caught offguard. “Our formations clearly weren’t
capable of killing him. Why did he have to use a treasure to tear
through them like that?” Ning’s face was ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archon Silksnow is
famous for his overbearing manner. I finally understand what that
entails.” Ninedust felt a sense of grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” After having
destroyed the entire planet the two were on, Archon Silksnow charged
straight towards Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
pulling Ninedust into his estate-world. “Ninedust, I’ll come up
with a way to escape. I think I have a chance of fleeing, but if I
cannot… just pray.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Ninedust gritted his teeth after being drawn into the estate-world.
However, he knew that the difference in power between him and Archon
Silksnow was simply far too great. Ning might be able to struggle for
a bit, but it would be suicide for Ninedust to try and fight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting Ninedust
away, Ning immediately charged into the skies and began to fly even
higher. “Break!” Ning attempted to tear through space, but the
blurry golden light which covered an area of ten billion kilometers
around them caused spacetime to stabilize to such a degree that there
was no way to tear through it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
produced a strange black-and-white disc in his hands. This was the
spacetime disk which Hegemon Brightshore had given him all those
years ago. He instantly activated the power hidden within it, causing
a terrifying ripple of might to descend and envelope him, then tear
forcibly through the frozen spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the vast halo
of golden light began to shudder as though it was trying to suppress
the effects of the item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Archon
Silksnow revealed a look of shock. “Is that… a spacetime disc?
Hegemon Brightshore’s spacetime disc?” Given how long he had been
around for, Archon Silksnow was naturally quite familiar with this
type of spacetime disc. In truth, all of the top-tier elites of the
Endless Territories knew how much Hegemon Brightshore cared about his
royal clan, the Brightshore Imperials, and how much he cared about
the Daolords of the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Hegemon Brightshore
to bestow a spacetime disc upon a Daolord was a sign that the Hegemon
viewed that person with great favor. Most major powers would give
face upon seeing it and not act against the person in question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. For the sake
of the realmship and the Sithe legacies, I’ll just bear the
consequences,” Archon Silksnow said with a cold smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
spacetime disc was doing its best to tear through spacetime, while
the ten billion kilometers of blurry light was doing its best to
stabilize and suppress it. The two were battling against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! The black-white
disc in Ning’s hands suddenly and completely shattered apart. The
blurry light covering the surrounding area was now much dimmer… but
it was still there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It failed.” Ning
was stunned. This was the most formidable escape treasure he had
available to him… but he still hadn’t been able to breach the
frozen field of spacetime. “What should I do now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
ice-cold. His most formidable fleeing treasure had failed, while he
wasn’t strong enough to overcome his opponent… what was he to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Hegemon
Brightshore was here in person, he might be able to breach this
field… but that treasure of yours was nothing more than something
he created and infused with part of his power. He’s gifted them to
quite a few Daolords! If that’s all you have, you won’t be able
to escape… and if you won’t be able to escape, you are going to
die. That Ninedust Sectlord hiding in your estate-world will die as
well.” Archon Silksnow’s voice boomed outwards. He surpassed Ning
in every single aspect, save for the [Heartsword] art! Ning’s
[Heartsword] art was still took weak; he had merely reached the tenth
stance and was still at the first ‘stage’ of it. It simply
couldn’t make up of the overwhelming disparity in power between the
two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was like
Emperor Heartsword and had mastered all fifteen stances, he would be
truly and freakishly powerful. Alas, breaking through each stage of
the [Heartsword] was simply too difficult, as was making a
breakthrough with the Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t die. If I
die, Ninedust is doomed as well.” Ning felt a powerful urge to stay
alive. If he died, he would be revived thanks to the Dao-seal he had
acquired in that alternate universe… but his weapons and treasures
would all be gone. The nine novessence arts and the protective divine
ability he had trained in would be lost as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The loss of the
treasures was secondary, as he would be able to come back to life.
Ninedust, however, could not. Ninedust didn’t even have a
Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die then.” Archon
Silksnow had already appeared in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I cannot lose. I
cannot be defeated. I still have a chance, a tiny chance!” A
terrifying blaze of light appeared in Ning’s eyes. “Time to go
all out. This sort of deadly battle is extremely effective in helping
one understand sword-arts better. I’ve been training in seclusion
for hundreds of millions of years, but I still haven’t been able to
reach the fourth stage of my Omega Sword Dao. Perhaps if I gain
enough insights from this fight, it’ll aid me in making my
breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can reach the
fourth stage of the Omega Sword Dao… not only will I be able to
stay alive, I’ll be able to win!” Ning’s eyes were blazing with
unshakable resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Archon
Silksnow’s saber-light descended. It was so cold as to freeze
Ning’s heart, so fast as to cause Ning to shudder. This time,
Archon Silksnow struck out at Ning with all six sabers at the same
time. Clearly, he wanted to leave nothing up to chance at all and was
seeking to slay Ning with one attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I absolutely have to
block this.” Ning strove to execute his sword-arts, generating an
enormous black hole around him which sought to devour all of the
saber-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! This collision
was far larger than the last one. Ning was sent flying through the
air, a line of blood leaking out from the corner of his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you really
have some power after all. I used six sabers and struck at you with
my full power. I thought that I’d be able to reduce you to dust…
but you only suffered a few light wounds. Your protective divine
ability truly is formidable.” Archon Silksnow’s voice echoed
through the void as he continued to charge after Ning, not pausing at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, his
strikes are within the realm of what I can endure.” Ning licked the
blood from his lips. “Although he’s strong, he won’t be able to
kill me. Given my Hegemon armor and my protective divine ability,
only a real Hegemon should be able to crush my body in one shot. I
still have a chance. I still have a chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were able to
block me once… but will you be able to block ten times? A hundred
times? You are doomed.” Archon Silksnow’s oily green eyes were
filled with an awesome savagery.
</P>

Chapter 19 - A Single Tear
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning wasn’t a
fool, nor was he foolishly overconfident. Although he hoped to be
able to make use of this deadly battle to break through his current
bottleneck, he knew that there were too many variables in play here.
He might actually be able to make a breakthrough… but it was more
likely that he would fail! Breaking through the bottleneck to become
a Daolord of the Fourth Step was no easy task, after all. Ning’s
path was that of the Omega Sword Dao; if he wanted to break through,
it would be even harder than it had been for Ninedust and harder than
it would be for Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t dare to
completely entrust all his hopes into making a breakthrough. Thus, as
soon as the spacetime disc failed he immediately asked Hegemon
Brightshore for aid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Send word to Hegemon
Brightshore. Tell him that Daolord Darknorth is willing to give him
fifty of the coldflame cauldron fruits and all the remaining fruits
from Crimsonwave Temple, in order to request the Hegemon to intervene
and save his life. Archon Silksnow is currently trying to kill him,
and he can die at any moment,” Ning instructed the servant who was
in charge of maintaining contact between him and the Brightshore
Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
servant was shocked upon hearing how grim the situation was, and he
immediately sent word over to the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope the Hegemon
will intervene,” Ning mused to himself. The Hegemon was an exalted
figure who was the supreme leader of the entire Brightshore Kingdom!
To the supreme figures of the Endless Territories, a Daolord really
didn’t count for much, no matter how monstrously talented the
Daolord was. This was because the more talented a Daolord was, the
lower his chances of succeeding in the Daomerge would be. The
Brightshore Kingdom had its Twelve Palaces, but in all of its years
of existence none of its supreme Daolords had ever succeeded in the
Daomerge. Hegemon Brightshore remained the one and only Hegemon of
the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus… Hegemons
generally didn’t care about whether Daolords died or not. For them
to perish while out adventuring was quite normal. They’d calmly
watch as one generation of Daolords after another rose to power,
followed by one generation after another perishing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But fifty coldflame
cauldron fruits might be enough to convince the Hegemon to intervene.
Although the Hegemon managed to trade for some of that fruit after
our trip to Crimsonwave Temple, I don’t think he got fifty,” Ning
prayed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master! The
Hegemon sends word that he is heading towards you with my clone.
However, he is going to need some time. He asks you to hold on for a
bit,” the servant immediately replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Right at this
moment, Ning had been knocked backwards with blood leaking from the
corner of his lips. He couldn’t help but feel delighted upon
hearing this. “Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to hold on
for a bit. If I can hold on for a while, the Hegemon will be able to
make it here,” Ning thought eagerly. He knew that since the Hegemon
wasn’t sure as to where he was exactly, the Hegemon needed his
servant to guide the way. That delay, combined with what a great
distance the Hegemon had to traverse via tearing through spacetime,
meant that the Hegemon did need some time before he could arrive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, such a short
period of time was meaningless. However, Ning was in the middle of a
life-and-death battle against someone who was one of the lords of the
Sacred Cities. That short period of time was quite long in this
situation, more than enough for Archon Silksnow to strike a hundred
times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Archon
Silksnow’s long hair fluttered behind him as he let out a loud
shout. Boom! Countless streams of saber-ki flew out from around him,
forming a vast world of saber energy that crashed down upon Ning.
Clearly, Archon Silksnow wished to end this battle as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth!” Ning
didn’t dare to hold anything back at all. Nine energy dragons
immediately flew out of his body, forming the Yin-Yang Chaos Domain
as his awesome heartworld projection came crashing down as well. The
heartworld projection merged into the Yin-Yang Chaos Domain, then
clashed straight against the surrounding world of saber-ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two domains
collided against each other… and the saber-ki domain was actually
at a slight disadvantage. This caused Archon Silksnow to feel rather
flabbergasted. He then smiled coldly: “So you have a few tricks of
your own. However… you are still going to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow charged
straight towards Ning with pure, unadulterated savagery! His six
sabers executed his exceptionally brutal and valiant Dao of the
Saber. Before his sabers, even spacetime was frozen and even karma
was severed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attack! Attack! Attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to survive.
For Ninedust’s sake if nothing else, I have to survive.” Ning
labored to defend himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
battle between the two caused the skies to darken. Archon Silksnow
lived up to his reputation as one of the top three Archons. His
attacks were incredibly ferocious, which only made sense; the Dao of
the Saber was an offensive Dao, after all. Ning was completely unable
to fight back, but when he focused completely on defense his six
swords were able to form a truly airtight defense. Still, he was
knocked backwards again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Darknorth really is pretty formidable.” Archon Silksnow struck out
ten times in a row, but Ning was able to endure all ten attacks. This
caused Archon Silksnow to narrow his eyes. “Everyone says that
Winesage is the most powerful Daolord, but it seems as though this
Daolord Darknorth is actually more powerful than Winesage! I can
hardly believe that there’s a Daolord capable of taking ten blows
from me in a row.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was only
able to accomplish this thanks to his [Heartsword] art, which had
increased his strength dramatically and made his sword-arts even
faster and more ferocious! Without it, Archon Silksnow probably
would’ve been able to blast Ning’s six swords out of his hands
and then kill Ning right away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too
resilient. If this continues, I don’t even know how many attacks
it’ll take to kill him.” A cold light flashed through Archon
Silksnow’s oily green eyes. “Forget it. I’ll make an exception
for him and use my [Icesnow] saber-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Archon
Silksnow’s six sabers began to move in unison. Three of them became
incredibly savage and overbearing, while the other three actually
became unpredictable and ephemeral, almost like the dancing of the
snow. Their movements were very soft and extremely difficult to see
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning saw this, his
face turned extremely pale. Although the earlier attacks were savage
and powerful, they were fairly easy to block as a result. Now that
Archon Silksnow was using this strange combination of savagery and
softness, merging the principles of Yin and Yang together, blocking
the attacks became far more difficult than before. The snow-like
saber-arts didn’t have as much power behind them, but they were
much more troublesome for Ning to defend against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like how
the Heavenbreaker stance was much more powerful than the Blood Drop
stance, but the Blood Drop stance was far superior in speed thanks to
having sacrificed a degree of power. The most powerful attack wasn’t
necessarily the best attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Slash!
Slash! Swords and sabers collided nonstop. Ning was forced to use
four of his swords to defend against those three sabers executing the
unpredictable [Icesnow] saber-art, leaving him only two swords to
defend against the other three extremely savage sabers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Using just two
swords to defend clearly wasn’t enough. A savage burst of power
rocked Ning’s entire body, causing it to tremble as he was sent
flying backwards. Ning vomited out a mouthful a blood, his face
ashen. His divine power was being depleted far too quickly. Ning’s
hands were numb, and even his soul was beginning to feel a bit woozy.
Clearly, his sword-arts weren’t able to ablate enough of his
enemy’s attack power, causing his divine body to endure most of it.
As a result, his injuries were now much heavier than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I became one
of the Archons of the Sacred Cities, on the occasions when I acted
against Daolords I always used my most powerful and overwhelming
attacks to crush them directly. You are the first Daolord I wasn’t
able to crush in such a manner, forcing me to use my [Icesnow]
saber-arts. Normally, I’ll only use it when I battle against other
Emperors. You should feel proud to die these saber-arts,” Archon
Silksnow said as he once more charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His saber-arts fell
upon Ning like the snow, drifting and ephemeral.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His saber-light flashed
like lightning, piercing directly into one’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were two
diametrically different types of saber-arts, making it far more
difficult to defend against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Ning was
starting to grow dizzy from the hits he was taking. His divine body
found it hard to endure these attacks, and he was starting to decline
from peak condition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. If I let this
continue, I’m going to die!” Ning understood that each time he
blocked, he was walking on a fine line between life and death. In
less than ten stances, he would perish to this opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I die, I can be
revived thanks to my Dao-seal… but Ninedust will be dead for sure.”
A surge of indomitable will and resolve came out of Ning’s soul.
This resolve was absolutely unshakable, a form of power that came
from his very spirit… and Ning’s sword-arts suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, his strikes
had taken the form of mist-formed swords. All of a sudden, the mist
began to condense and transform into drops of water. The countless
water drops condensed into a sword that looked as though it was made
out of water. The watery swords rippled with absolute beauty but
emanated a mesmerizing level of might… and both the speed and power
of Ning’s strikes skyrocketed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heartsword], stance
eleven… ‘Teardrop’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two forces
collided. Ning was still knocked flying backwards, and he was still
at a disadvantage… but this time, he didn’t spit out any blood at
all. Clearly, the force of the collision was not enough to cause him
any injuries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Archon
Silksnow’s face completely changed. “The eleventh stance of the
[Heartsword] art?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The distant
Ning revealed a smile. “Archon Silksnow, you live up to your
reputation. You recognized my technique at a single glance. This is
indeed the eleventh stance of the [Heartsword] art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why it was
comparatively easier for cultivators to make breakthroughs in
near-death situations was because those situations placed the soul
and truesoul under enormous pressure, causing them to enter a special
state that made it easier for one to have epiphanies and then make
breakthroughs. Ning wasn’t just in a life-and-death situation, he
was also under the pressure of being responsible for Ninedust’s
survival. This made his desire to win even stronger, and those strong
emotions and tremendous desire to survive caused his [Heartsword] art
to finally break through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that he
made his breakthrough, he finally understood. The eleventh stance of
the [Heartsword] art, the ‘Teardrop’, required incredible resolve
and willpower! Long ago, Emperor Heartsword had been facing certain
death for the sake of protecting those he loved. He had smiled into
the face of death as tears spilled down his face… but in that
instant, he had a sudden epiphany and managed to develop the eleventh
stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each cultivator had
their own paths to take if they wished to create such profound,
abstruse sword-arts. God Emperor Helong, for example, had created his
[God Emperor’s Apocalypse] technique, a technique similar to the
[Heartsword] art in that it perfectly merged heartforce, divine
power, and Immortal energy together. It also required a terrifying
amount of resolve and strong emotions, but the emotions involved had
to be a feeling of benevolence and care towards all living beings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only such a blazing
level of determination can allow heartforce, divine power, and
Immortal energy to merge together in a more perfect manner.” Ning
finally understood.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? How could his [Heartsword] art have advanced to the
eleventh stance? That means he’ll reach the twelfth stance soon!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘first stage’
of the [Heartsword] art consisted of the eighth to tenth stances,
while the second stage consisted of the eleventh and twelfth stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had made
consecutive breakthroughs in the ‘first stage’ back when he was
in Crimsonwave Temple. Breaking through between stances within the
same stage was quite fast, while breaking through from one stage to
another was far more difficult. Since Ning had already reached the
eleventh stance, the twelfth stance wouldn’t be too far behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth’s
sword-arts are extremely well-rounded and extremely durable. If he
can master the twelfth stance… he’ll be on par with even me.”
Archon Silksnow’s killing intent began to grow stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Heartsword,
even after becoming an Eternal Emperor, was only comparable to
supreme Daolords when it came to his actual insights into the Dao of
the Sword. He was actually weaker in this regard than the current
Ning. However, thanks to his mastery of the fifteenth stance of the
[Heartsword] art, he had completely eclipsed all other Archons and
was second only to the Hegemons. He was known throughout the Endless
Territories as the only Emperor who was comparable to Hegemons in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning had
mastered the eleventh stance, the power of his strikes was three
times as much as it was ‘normally’. Soon, when he mastered the
twelfth stance, his strikes would be comparable to six times his
‘normal’ power! How incredible would this be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all thanks to
this terrifying technique that Emperor Heartsword had been able to
battle those who were two levels of power above him and be able to
battle the three mighty Hegemons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
two continued to battle furiously. Ning was knocked flying
repeatedly, but he was able to endure the blows with ease. This was
because his sword-arts were faster and fiercer than before, allowing
him to completely defend against his foe’s attacks. “A hundred
strikes? I can block even a thousand strikes from him. He might hold
the upper hand, but if I completely focus on defense I can endure
fairly easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, die!”
Archon Silksnow’s oily green eyes grew colder and colder as his
saber-arts fluctuated between incomparable savagery and snow-like
unpredictability. Ning was completely unable to fight back at all,
and with each strike he sent Ning flying away. He was completely
dominating Ning, forcing Ning to focus exclusively on defense… but
Archon Silksnow really was completely unable to do anything to the
defense-oriented Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His defenses are
completely without flaws. His sword-arts have no weaknesses
whatsoever.” Archon Silksnow was extremely vexed by this; foes with
perfect defensive abilities were extremely difficult to deal with.
Even those more powerful than Ning would find it hard to breach his
defensive sword-arts. “Am I really going to have to use one of my
treasures to deal with a single Daolord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given his current
level of power, not even common Hegemon-level treasures are certain
to kill him. I would have to use one of my most important treasures.”
Archon Silksnow felt a bit of heartache at the prospect. “I’ve
only accumulated so many of them despite the passage of countless
years… I was planning on using them in critical situations to
defend against Hegemons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow
continued to hesitate as the two exchanged blows. Archon Silksnow was
vacillating; he really didn’t want to use up his most important
treasures. His more ordinary treasures such as ‘common’ Hegemonic
treasures might be precious to Daolords, but Archon Silksnow had
quite a few of them. However, those treasures generally only held
twenty to thirty percent of the full power of a Hegemon’s strike.
It wasn’t enough to kill an Archon of the Sacred Cities, nor was it
enough to kill the current Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Archon Silksnow
hesitated, he continued to hope that his furious barrage of attacks
would be enough to kill Ning. If he could avoid using one of his
life-saving treasures, he would do so; he wasn’t going to use those
things up casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip. Far away,
within the empty void that was beyond the area of ten billion
kilometers covered by the blurry light, a tear in spacetime suddenly
appeared. This tear was enormous in size, and from it emerged the
enormous head of an absolutely titanic beast. The eyes on this head
looked like blazing stars, and they turned to stare at the distant
field of combat, locking in on both Archon Silksnow and Daolord
Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow sensed
this new present, and he immediately turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archon Silksnow,
stay your hand,” the titanic beast said in a rumbling voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon
Brightshore!” Archon Silksnow’s face immediately turned pale.
Hegemon Brightshore had actually charged over here in person, using
his true body?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow had
been hesitating, but a savage look immediately appeared on his face.
He produced an ordinary-looking black hammer in his hands, then
immediately tossed it out. The black warhammer transformed into an
enormous streak of golden light which smashed straight towards the
distant Ning. As it flew, the black warhammer’s light began to
increase dramatically as it became golden in color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warhammer was
dazzling to behold, and its aura alone caused Ning to feel the desire
to prostrate himself before it. Ning forced down that thought, but he
still felt a sense of shock in his heart. He hurriedly crushed two
protective treasures, causing a barrier of water to appear around him
as well as a strange river to cover him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silksnow!” Hegemon
Brightshore was enraged. His enormous body stretched out a single
claw which tore straight through the blurry light. Boom! The barrier
was completely ripped open. However… by the time he tore through
it, the dazzling golden warhammer had already reached Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying wave of
power smashed against Ning, blasting through the river around him and
shattering the watery barrier. Although Ning strove to use his
Northbow swords to defend, the power of this strike vastly surpassed
the strikes which Archon Silksnow had unleashed previously. Ning’s
six arms were immediately torn apart, and his six Northbow swords
were sent flying as the terrifying power from the strike swept
through Ning’s entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power was simply
too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I… am going to
die?” Ning only had enough time to turn his head to glance at the
distant Hegemon Brightshore. As Ning stared at the titanic beast, his
lips moved slightly. He wanted to say: “Save Ninedust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Ning didn’t
have a chance to say a single word. His body was completely crushed
into dust, leaving only a few magic treasures and his armor behind,
floating in the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO! Damn you!” The
blazing, star-like eyes of Hegemon Brightshore were filled with fury.
He had already spoken, but Archon Silksnow had actually chosen to
kill Ning right in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip. He had
already torn straight through the blurry barrier of light. Now, the
Hegemon’s claw tore straight towards Archon Silksnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archon Silksnow had
immediately transformed into a streak of light and flown towards Ning
in the same instant that he used up one of his trump cards. He wanted
to take away the treasures which Ning had left behind. He knew that
Ninedust and the realmship parts were all within Ning’s
estate-world treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you actually
think you are going to take the treasures as well?” This enraged
Hegemon Brightshore even further. His eyes emanated an aura of blurry
light which caused spacetime to congeal in the surrounding area. A
wave of invisible pressure crushed down upon Archon Silksnow, causing
him to dramatically slow down. As for Hegemon Brightshore’s claws,
they tore straight through space itself as they reached out towards
Archon Silksnow. Previously, that aura of blurry light had condensed
local spacetime… but now that it had been destroyed, Hegemon
Brightshore’s attacks were able to almost instantly reach the
target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast! The old man
really lives up to his reputation as the premier Hegemon amongst the
three Hegemons in our realmverse.” Archon Silksnow hurriedly used
his saber-arts to defend against that terrifying claw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The terrifying
claw-strike came, filled with such power that it was equal in might
to the black warhammer treasure which Archon Silksnow had just used.
Archon Silksnow was instantly shattered into tiny pieces of snow, but
that snow quickly reassembled far away into Archon Silksnow once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Autarch Bolin was
a Hegemon, he had trained and mastered a total of ten Hegemonic Daos!
All that accumulated experience had allowed him to break through to
become an Autarch. Emperors possessed endless lifespans and thus
would generally train in many Daos, hoping that these other Daos
might stimulate and inspire them! Emperor Silksnow himself was
skilled in both the Dao of the Saber and the Dao of Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had undergone the
Daomerge via his Dao of the Saber and reached the Archon level of
power. Over the course of countless years, he had slowly upgraded his
Dao of Snow to that same level. Clearly, he wanted to use these two
Daos to inspire him and slowly train to the Hegemon level via them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was possible for
Emperors to train and cultivate, but improving was extremely
difficult. Every single person who had been alive for that long,
however, had life-preserving abilities available to them. The
difference in power between Archons and Hegemons was quite apparent,
and in a real head-on battle the Archon would definitely perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, some Archons
had defensive techniques like invulnerable forms, while others were
extremely skilled in other ways. For example, if one was extremely
proficient in the Dao of Numerancy, one would be forewarned of danger
and flee early on. Alternately, if one had an extremely formidable
evasion art then one would be able to rely on it to escape and
prevent even Hegemons from catching up to them and killing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
reached the Archon level, true… but he had merely trained in the
Omega Sword Dao and didn’t have an invulnerable form. In addition,
he had only been training for a very brief period of time and had not
accumulated enough treasures yet. There was simply no way for him to
compete against the likes of Archon Silksnow. The elder Archons had
accumulated many treasures of the years, some of which could have an
impact on even actual Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon Brightshore,
are you really going to interfere over me killing a mere Daolord?”
Archon Silksnow stood off in the distance. Although he was unhappy,
he suppressed his anger. “You and I have both lived in the Endless
Territories for countless years. These Daolords come and go; there
are nothing more than passerbys in our life. Daolord Darknorth
angered me, so I decided to kill him; this is a minor matter. You, an
exalted Hegemon, actually decided to interfere? This is a bit much,
isn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore’s
voice boomed out sonorously from afar: “Archon Silksnow, this was
indeed a minor matter… but since I spoke out, you should’ve been
willing to discuss things peaceably. You actually dared to kill
Darknorth right in front of me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This little thief
was lucky enough to steal an item I needed,” Archon Silksnow said.
“Hegemon Brightshore, I don’t want any of his other treasures,
but I do want that little thief’s estate-world. If you are willing
to give it to me, you can list any conditions you want.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, you killed
Darknorth in front of me… and you think you’ll earn his
treasures?” Hegemon Brightshore said coldly, “Fuck off. If you
don’t… don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” Archon
Silksnow had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I said FUCK OFF!”
Hegemon Brightshore’s voice deepened even further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. A Hegemon
really is a Hegemon. I’ll accede to your request this time.”
Archon Silksnow ground his teeth, then turned and disappeared within
a dimensional ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Archon
Silksnow had chosen to kill Ning at that critical moment was
partially for the sake of the realmship… but more importantly, he
wanted to pull up grass by the roots! He understood that so long as
Ning survived, Ning would quickly be able to master the twelfth
stance of the [Heartsword] art. By then, the difference in power
between the two would be very small. There was already a feud between
them. If Ning failed his Daomerge, it would be guaranteed that Ning
would die. If he went crazy before dying… while Archon Silksnow
himself would be able to keep himself alive, the foundations of power
he had spent countless aeons establishing might be completely
annihilated by the maddened Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning succeeded in
the Daomerge? Things would be even worse! Thus, he had to kill Ning
right away. Taking the treasure was just a secondary benefit. Alas…
the Hegemon had stopped him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore
watched as Archon Silksnow left, neither chasing nor attacking.
Killing Archon Silksnow would be no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hegemon’s titanic
figure blurred, transforming into a humanoid figure. He returned to
his normal form of a snowy-robed, white-bearded old man with six
curved horns on his head. He waved his hand, collecting the Northbow
swords, estate-world, armor, and other treasures Ning had left
behind. He murmured softly to himself, “These treasures actually
still have an owner? Daolord Darknorth actually didn’t die… can
it be that he has a Primaltwin?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore
revealed a smile. He felt rather apologetic towards Ning for not
having been able to rescue him, but now he felt much better. “He
really does have a few tricks up his sleeve. Since he didn’t die…
his avatar should be at Vastheaven Palace. I’ll pay it a visit.”
Hegemon Brightshore took a single step forward, tearing through
spacetime as he travelled towards Vastheaven Palace.
