had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: The Church of Annihilation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Brightshore Kingdom of the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The black-robed Primaltwin Ji Ning appeared out of nowhere in front
of the imperial palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
snowy-robed old man had been waiting here for quite some time. It was
Hegemon Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,”
Hegemon Brightshore said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Brightshore, what is this about? You summoned me quite hastily,”
the black-robed Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was asked to do so by a friend.” Hegemon Brightshore smiled in a
rather embarrassed manner. “I didn’t want to bother you with this
request, but it involves a Hegemon who you are on very good terms
with – the Paragon of Pills.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ning’s pupils contracted: “The Paragon of Pills?
What’s this about?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have probably heard of my friend before; he’s the leader of the
Church of Annihilation in that otherverse you visited,” Hegemon
Brightshore said. “I can’t explain it as clearly as he can; I’ll
take you over to see him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go take a look then.” Ning had the vague feeling that the reason
why he wouldn’t be able to continue his relaxed, wandering life for
much longer was because of the Paragon of Pills and the lord of the
Church of Annihilation… and that this matter was of grave import!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
higher a level of insight one reached, the more clearly one would be
able to divine the tides of the future. But of course, the future was
always in a state of flux; no amount of scrying was guaranteed to be
accurate!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore led Ning through a spacetime tunnel to quickly arrive at
the alternate universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
tunnel again, eh?” Ning glanced at the empty void around him, then
at the enormous dimensional vortex. He let out a sigh. “It was me,
Skyfire Brightshore, Greatjoy, Solewind, and Firesurge who went on
that journey together all those years ago through this otherverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of them have achieved as much as you,” Hegemon Brightshore said.
“This is doubly true for Skyfire, who has progressed the least out
of the five. We Chaos Godbeasts are, as a race, slow in cultivation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
replied, “You have your boons, and you have your banes. Some things
you simply cannot force.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
those four friends, Skyfire, Greatjoy, and Solewind had been sincere
in their friendships towards him. Ning was able to keenly sense this
through the karma which tied them together. As for Firesurge… Ning
was able to discover through karma that Firesurge wasn’t all that
sincere, and as a result the karmic ties binding them were quite
weak. When Solewind, Greatjoy, and Skyfire were ready for the
Daomerge, Ning would send over some presents and help them as best he
could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
that was as much as he could do for them. He couldn’t even
guarantee that his own daughter Brightmoon would succeed in the
Daomerge; all he could do was prepare the treasures which would be of
use to her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wonder if those three and Ninedust will succeed in the Daomerge or
not,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a figure manifested out of nowhere within the primordial chaos in
front of Ning. This figure was extremely skinny and dressed in black
armor, and he radiated an icy aura. This person immediately bowed
respectfully towards Ning: “Annihilation pays his respects to you,
Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why this person had named his church the ‘Church of
Annihilation’ was because his own Daoist title was ‘Annihilation’!
This was a Daoist title he had chosen long ago, when he was young and
had no idea that one of the exalted Autarchs was also known as
‘Autarch Annihilation’. In truth, this was actually a fairly
common Daoist monicker. There were a number of commonly-used Daoist
titles which were shared by many cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
leader of the Church of Annihilation.” Ning nodded. “I heard of
you back when I was a World-level cultivator.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Back
then, Brightshore asked me to help out. I watched all five of you the
entire time, Daolord.” Lord Annihilation immediately squeezed out a
smile: “If I had known back then that you would reach such heights,
I would’ve done everything in my power to befriend you back then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
main goal back then was to temper Skyfire,” Hegemon Brightshore
said hurriedly. “That’s why I hid the truth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, I fully understand what you were intending and how much effort
you put into it. Chaos Godbeasts are solitary by nature, but you’ve
poured all of your energies into building up your clan.” Ning
smiled and nodded, then glanced at Lord Annihilation. “Speak,
Annihilation. Why have you sought me out… and for that matter, why
have you sent a mere incarnation? You didn’t even send your avatar,
much less your true body.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
one bound an otherverse, the otherverse would become akin to a clone.
An Otherverse Lord would be able to easily materialize an incarnation
anywhere within the otherverse. Even Otherverse Lords would feel
slighted by Lord Annihilation sending a mere incarnation to greet
them, to say nothing of someone of Ning’s stature!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
please forgive me. My true body and my avatar aren’t able to make
it back. There’s nothing I can do,” Lord Annihilation explained
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
this all about, and why is it connected to the Paragon of Pills?”
Ning asked. Ning felt a profound sense of fondness towards the
Paragon of Pills, because she truly had treated him very well. Ning
could sense that she loved him as she would a family member! Through
karma, Ning had previously been able to sense that she was still
alive, but was incredibly far away from him… but now, even after
entering the otherverse, Ning still felt she was incredibly far away
from him. This meant she clearly was no longer inside the otherverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
Lord Annihilation’s true body and avatar to also be absent… Ning
had a bad feeling about this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me explain the situation,” Lord Annihilation said respectfully.
“Daolord, I imagine you know that the Paragon of Pills has always
wanted to revive her three elder ‘brothers’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
all three of them were powerful Eternal Emperors, and one of them was
a Hegemon,” Lord Annihilation explained. “If they had died in the
outside world, not even Autarchs would be able to reverse spacetime
to revive them. Thankfully, they only died within my otherverse, but
the backlash that would be generated if I tried to bring them back
would probably cause the prime essences of my otherverse to collapse.
Only Autarchs are strong enough to prevent this from happening and
maintaining my otherverse’s stability while still reviving the
three of them. My otherverse would still be badly wounded, but it
would remain intact.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
understood this principle. When that Sword Hegemon had died, the
prime essences of the otherverse had naturally swallowed his truesoul
fragments right away. There was no way to force them to ‘spit it
back out’, because those truesoul fragments had already been
integrated into the deepest parts of the otherverse’s core,
becoming part of it. If Lord Annihilation tried to forcibly bring
them back, the damage caused to the otherverse would be enough to
cause its prime essences to break apart. The entire otherverse would
be doomed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
Autarchs were capable of reviving Hegemons in an otherverse without
destroying it, because they were the ones who had created the
otherverses to begin with. They knew how to protect the otherverses
and ensure that they were ‘merely’ injured, not destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Otherverses…
in the end, they were only comparable in size and scope to a
realmverse, and so the truesoul fragments of a Hegemon were
incredibly important and greatly beneficial to them. The awesomely
vast Chaosverse itself was naturally a different story; it was
countless times larger than any realmverse, and it was so mighty that
no Autarch could endure its power and bind it. Only a mythical Omega
Autarch would be capable of binding the Chaosverse, whereas even
ordinary Eternal Emperors were capable of binding an otherverse. The
difference was enormous!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“She
wanted to find an Autarch to revive the three of them,” Lord
Annihilation said, “Because this was her greatest goal, her reason
for cultivation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but sigh. Although he had only spent a limited amount
of time with her, he was able to sense how deep her feelings were
towards those three men.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
Autarchs would have to carefully protect and safeguard my otherverse
as they worked to revive the three of them. This is a very tiring and
very troublesome task,” Lord Annihilation said. “And in general,
Autarchs do not agree lightly to revive a Hegemon. The Paragon of
Pills once did manage to contact an Autarch, but the demands the
Autarch listed were so harsh that even I felt completely stupefied.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Harsh
demands ?” Ning asked, “What were the demands?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
asked for treasures equivalent to a thousand realmships in value,”
Lord Annihilation said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
Ning turned speechless upon hearing this. However, he knew what the
Autarchs were thinking. Cultivation was meant to be a dangerous path;
if everyone who died on this path could be brought back to life,
wouldn’t it make cultivation nothing more than a game? In addition,
reviving destroyed truesouls would have a negative impact on the very
fabric of reality and the laws of the Chaosverse. Yes, each revival
only had a small impact, but it could quickly add up. This was not a
good thing, especially when invaders from a foreign Chaosverse were
lying in wait.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the other hand, if they completely refused to revive anyone, they
would probably cause many cultivators to feel absolute despair… and
so, they had chosen to instead exact stringent requirements for their
aid. You want me to revive a Hegemon and two Emperors? Sure. Give me
a thousand realmships worth of treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
wager not even the Sithe have that many realmships.” Ning shook his
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Paragon of Pills asked the Autarch to guide her in finding enough
treasure. The Autarch told her that the Sithelands is filled with
treasure; the only problem was, was she woman enough to take them?”
Lord Annihilation continued, “And so, ever since she became a
Hegemon she began to make repeated trips to the Sithelands. To tell
you the truth, I’ve met countless cultivators, but I can count on
one hand how many people are as fearless and maniacal as she is in
her pursuit of Sithe treasures.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_002__The"></A>
Chapter 2: The Crazy Paragon of Pills</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
legends say that the Sithelands is the most dangerous place in the
Chaosverse,” Lord Annihilation said. “It can threaten even the
Autarchs! But it truly is filled with the most treasures as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are some who are very stubborn and are willing to place themselves at
high risk by repeatedly venturing into the Sithelands for the sake of
their goals. Those people are absolutely mad, but they are often
quite deadly. So long as they survive, their repeated journeys will
usually result in them possessing several Sithe weapons.” Lord
Annihilation said helplessly, “The Paragon of Pills is one such
madwoman. She’s quite famous, and she has multiple Sithe weapons.
Even I am merely on par with her in power! I would only have an
advantage if we actually fought inside my otherverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning fell silent. For the sake of her goals, she was willing to
repeatedly brave danger and tread the line between life and death.
Suddenly, the image of a woman clad in black gauze appeared within
Ning’s mind. This was a woman who was forever cold and distant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
they hadn’t known each other for too long, this woman had treated
him as family and had asked him to address her as ‘Mistress’,
with the Sword Hegemon being Ning’s ‘Master’. Ning still
clearly remembered the final words the Paragon of Pills had said to
him when they parted:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
must be very careful on your path of cultivation. If you encounter
any serious issues, you can use my name to warn those who would harm
you. It might be of some use.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can use my name to warn those who would harm you,” Ning murmured
softly. In the past, he hadn’t really taken this to heart… but
now, it seemed, she was known as a ‘madwoman’ who had so many
Sithe treasures, even Hegemons would feel a hint of trepidation. She
was also quite well-known, given how many trips she had made to the
Sithelands. That meant that her name would indeed be quite useful as
a protective talisman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is she now?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the Sithelands,” Lord Annihilation said hurriedly. “My true body
is there as well! Although I am an Otherverse Lord, I wasn’t a
Hegemon prior to taking control over the otherverse and so am weaker
than the Otherverse Lords in terms of my insights into the Dao. I’m
supported by the power of my otherverse, but in terms of raw power
I’m somewhere between a Hegemon and an ordinary Otherverse Lord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus,
I sometimes find it difficult to slay powerful Hegemons. Brother
Brightshore is a good example; it’d be very hard for me to kill
him,” Lord Annihilation said. “That’s why many major powers
seek to kill me and then take my otherverse, which makes life quite
miserable. I spend most of my time hiding inside of my otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
time, the Paragon of Pills found a truly remarkable place which she
felt certain was a Sithe treasury, but it was also a place of
incredible danger. She sent out invitations for people to join her. I
thought to myself, ‘Weak Sithe weapons are useless to you. If you
are going to take a risk, go all out and take a big one!’ The
Paragon of Pills has visited the Sithelands many times and is
experienced in navigating it, and so I decided to take part in this
trip.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Myself,
the Paragon of Pills, and two others headed off on this journey
together. One of the two is just as crazy as the Paragon of Pills is.
As it turned out, the Paragon’s predictions were correct; she truly
did find an enormous Sithe treasury, but it was filled with many
dangers,” Lord Annihilation said. “In the end, we were defeated
and one of us died, leaving just three of us alive; myself, the
Paragon, and that other madman. However, all three of us ended up
being separated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be honest, when we headed in we already knew of your illustrious
fame. Back then, many of us were actually commenting that the Paragon
now stood a very good chance of achieving her goals. If she asked you
to help out, she’d probably be able to revive her three brothers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
she refused to send you a message, even after we fell into grave
danger. She said that the treasury was far too dangerous, and she
knew that if you found out you would probably go there to rescue her…
but the end result might be that you yourself would also be trapped.”
Lord Annihilation continued, “Now, all three of us have been split
apart. All of us are in mortal danger… and so I can no longer
afford to respect her decision not to contact you. That’s why I
have come to ask you to help out, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded somberly. The Sithelands was indeed extremely dangerous! Even
the Autarchs had merely sealed it away, not daring to trespass too
deeply within it. If they did, even they would be at risk of
perishing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
the outer perimeter held a number of extremely dangerous areas which
had simply been sealed off rather than penetrated and destroyed.
Thus, even if Lord Annihilation was to ask an Autarch for help, the
Autarch would probably be unwilling to assist. There were some
unexplored places which even the Autarchs were unfamiliar with; it
just wouldn’t be worth it for them to risk themselves like that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait.
You came here to ask Darknorth to go into the Sithelands to rescue
you?” Hegemon Brightshore glared at him, hard. “Annihilation,
that’s not what you told me earlier.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was afraid that if I told you too much, you wouldn’t help me.”
Lord Annihilation hurriedly apologized, “Brightshore, I’m sorry
about this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
son of a…” Hegemon Brightshore was absolutely livid. “The
Paragon of Pills is crazy, and you yourself said the third person is
also a madman. I don’t really approve of their behavior in general,
but I have to admit that all of them are extremely well-versed in the
dangers of the Sithelands. If both of them are trapped with no way
out, then the area you were in was definitely an incredibly dangerous
one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Lord Annihilation nodded shamefacedly. It was indeed incredibly
dangerous. He could still remember that nightmarish battle which had
claimed the life of their fourth party member. The other three had
been lucky enough to survive, but had ended up being separated. Even
when they had been together, progress had been arduous. Now that they
were separated, their chances were exceedingly grim. That was why he
had come to beg Darknorth for aid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them were much weaker than Daolord Darknorth, who had slain even
the Lonely King with a single swipe of the sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
I really was out of options,” Lord Annihilation said, rather
embarrassed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tell
me where you are in the Sithelands,” Ning said. “I’ll go there
as soon as possible. Also… do everything you can to protect the
Mistress. Otherwise… when I see you, you are still going to die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Mistress?” Lord Annihilation was stunned. He knew that Ning had a
very special relationship with the Paragon of Pills, but he had no
idea that Ning would refer to her using such a close and familial
term.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Star
map.” Ning looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here’s
the star map, Daolord.” Lord Annihilation waved his hand, causing a
star map to appear before them. The only parts of the star map which
were detailed were the parts involving the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gave it a glance. The five Autarchs had long ago provided Ning with a
highly detailed star map of the entire Chaosverse, and they had taken
especially detailed notes on the Sithelands, the only place which was
a threat to them. Ning had a far more detailed map of the Sithelands
than Lord Annihilation, and as a result he immediately knew where
they were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
I understand.” Ning nodded, then turned and went back into the
spacetime tunnel with Hegemon Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two returned to the Brightshore Kingdom of the Flamedragon
realmverse. Hegemon Brightshore’s wizened old face was covered with
embarrassment: “Darknorth, I had no idea that Annihilation was
going to make a request like this one. We’ve known each other
forever. I can’t believe he pulled something like this on me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “His life was at stake. Playing a little trick on
you is nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Wildsky Realmverse. The Greatland Planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
true body was there alongside his eighth disciple Stonepool, Ji
Brightmoon, Ji Yichuan, Yuchi Snow, Subhuti, Windfiend, Su Youji,
Azurefiend, Protector Whitethaw, and the Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not going to lie. This trip to the Sithelands will be a bit risky,”
Ning said. “I’m not sure I’d be able to keep you all safe, and
so all of you shall wait here. I’ve already sent word to Realmslord
Windgrace to come and pick you up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
only had just a single realmship, and Ning needed it to visit the
Sithelands. Thus, he asked Windgrace to come and pick them up. The
sooner he went off to rescue the Paragon of Pills, the better his
chances would be. His family wouldn’t be in any danger here in the
Wildsky Realmverse either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
originally had two realmships, but Ning had already given the one he
had taken from the Lonely King to Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
let me go with you,” Su Youji said hurriedly. “I’m not afraid
of any danger.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ning,
my son…” Yuchi Snow was rather worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “None of you are to follow me! Flamewing, protect
them all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Master… but make sure you are careful in there,” Flamewing
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
will.” Ning glanced at Azurefiend. “Azurefiend, you are more
detail-oriented than him. Take good care of my family and my master.
Your avatar can come by my side.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Hegemon Azurefiend revealed a look of delight. A place which even
Ning felt was dangerous was a place Hegemon Azurefiend would never
dare to visit in person, but his avatar was a different story. Being
able to experience a dangerous place like this would be of benefit to
him in cultivation. He knew that Ning was trying to help him out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Su Youji and Brightmoon? They also had avatars, but those were
back in the Flamedragon Realmverse. More importantly, they were far
too weak. Even if they did create new avatars, the distance between
this place and the Sithelands was simply too far. There was no way
their true body would be able to sense and connect to the avatar at
such a distance, which meant that the tiny bit of godsense within the
avatar would eventually disappear and dissipate from the lack of
reinforcement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
the only person who was lucky enough to take part in this adventure
would be Hegemon Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brightmoon,
I have a task for you.” Ning looked at his daughter. “This new
disciple of mine, Stonepool, has yet to truly embark upon the path of
cultivation. I’ll temporarily leave his tutelage up to you. Teach
him until you are back at the Flamedragon Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I’m a Daolord. Teaching him will be no problem.”
Brightmoon was extremely confident. She glanced at Stonepool and
said, “Junior apprentice-brother Stonepool, I’ll train you well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
Stonepool said obediently. Everyone here was at an unfathomably more
profound level of the Dao than he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
very day, Ning led Azurefiend’s avatar in travelling towards the
Sithelands via realmship.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_003__The"></A>
Chapter 3: Entry</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending over 12 million years travelling a great distance via
realmship, Ji Ning and Azurefiend’s avatar finally reached the
outer perimeters of the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the Sithelands?” Ning stared at the titanic glowing sphere
that lay amidst the endless darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were still quite far away from this sphere, and it was roughly
comparable to twenty or so realmverses in size! This was the enormous
base which the Sithe had secretly constructed after infiltrating the
local Chaosverse. The process had been very fast, too fast to stop,
because the Sithe had constructed the main parts outside of the
Chaosverse, then brought them inside and assembled them together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was like a nail which the Sithe had driven into the body of the
Chaosverse, a nail which the cultivators were completely helpless
against.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship quickly flew closer and closer towards the Sithelands.
Finally, they entered the sphere. Light flashed past their eyes,
resolving into a strange, delightfully bizarre world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithelands was like a self-contained ecosystem, with the world within
it being completely different from the rest of the Chaosverse! It
even contained a few stars in the sky, although the stars had all
been battered and broken to the point where the Sithe machinery
underneath could be seen. Mysterious runes continued to flow over the
surface of those skeletal stars, and they continued to hum with
power. Clearly, they must have been incredibly powerful in the past!
There was no way for cultivators to take them away and move them
elsewhere; they were simply too large in size. Autarchs might be able
to do so, but they wouldn’t deign to collect ‘garbage’ like
this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
we broke through their outer defenses, the cultivators who were
present already took away all the Sithe weapons they could move,”
Ning mused. “The only places in the outer perimeter that are still
filled with many Sithe weapons are those forbidden regions which were
sealed away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
we are probably heading into one of those sealed regions, right?”
Hegemon Azurefiend felt a mixture of nervousness, excitement, and
anticipation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War itself, time was of the essence. Thus, the Autarchs
simply did whatever was the most expedient. They sealed away the
toughest and most dangerous regions in the outer perimeter, trapping
their foes inside. The trapped foes would no longer pose any further
threat, after all! They had sealed away many regions during the final
invasion. In the end, the heartland regions of the Sithelands had
proved to be so deadly that the Autarchs had sealed it away as well,
after killing any and all Sithe who dared to come out and fight back!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
had to be many powerful experts who were still alive within the heart
of the Sithelands, including a number of Sithe Exalts, but they were
no longer able to leave it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
might be able to win a battle on their own terms and on their own
turf, but the Autarchs wouldn’t go inside to fight them. Thus,
their only choice would be to fight outside… but without the
geographical advantage, the end result would be defeat followed by
imprisonment, just like the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are many barriers in the outer perimeters. Over the aeons since the
Dawn War, many have been slowly unlocked,” Ning said. “The
Autarchs are not opposed to watching Hegemons unlock the barriers and
test themselves inside.” Even if the Hegemons perished, their
truesoul fragments and energies would return to the Quintessence.
This wouldn’t have much of an impact on the Chaosverse as a whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, if for example 70% to 80% of all the Hegemons in the
Chaosverse were to perish? This sort of large-scale death would
certainly have an impact, in that the Chaosverse would be poorly
equipped for dealing with any foreign invaders. It simply wouldn’t
have enough defenders! Yes, the Autarchs had played a major role in
defending it against the Sithe, but the many Hegemons who had bravely
stood up had also played an important role.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, there simply weren’t enough Autarchs to go around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
month went past. By now, Ning had finally reached the region where
the Paragon of Pills had been trapped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there in the air, staring at a planet that was surrounded by a
billowing black fog. As for Azurefiend’s avatar, it stood behind
Ning to one side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is one of the sealed regions. The Autarchs didn’t attack it, and so
it is in perfect shape,” Ning mused softly. “Even from here, I
can dimly sense the threat it poses. I imagine the Autarchs were able
to sense the same, which was why they sealed it off instead of
attacking it. Oh, Mistress… how could you be so impetuous as to
challenge a place like this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Powerful
Sithe weapons can only be found in undamaged places that were
completely sealed off,” Hegemon Azurefiend said. “If you are
careful enough, you might be able to avoid some of the dangers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone’s
putting all their faith on luck.” Ning shook his head. Some
cultivators would succeed, true, but many would end up dying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go inside.” Whoosh. Ning led Azurefiend in flying towards the
planet of billowing black fog at high speeds. Hiss… the black mist
was so highly corrosive that weaker Eternal Emperors would quickly be
rotted away into a pile of noxious water. However, Ning’s Sword Dao
Domain was able to easily hold the mist at bay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two continued to fly together through the sea of black mist. They
flew for over ten billion kilometers before finally passing through
to the surface of the planet below. This was a desolate planet whose
surface was filled with countless streams of freezing energy. As Ning
and Azurefiend landed on the ground, they turned to stare at the
world around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
where should we go?” Azurefiend asked. “I can feel a powerful
sense of danger coming from this place, as though moving in any
direction will result in annihilation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs sealed away this place because they weren’t willing to
spend their energies here, and also because this place can kill
Hegemons with ease.” Ning shook his head. As he spoke, he continued
to carefully scrutinize the world with his karmic senses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as he descended upon this world, he was able to use his karma
lines to sense and locate both Lord Annihilation and the Paragon of
Pills. The karmic connection between Ning and the Paragon of Pills
went without saying, while Lord Annihilation’s decision to beg Ning
to rescue him had also established karmic ties between them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are both in that direction.” After carefully tracing his karmic
ties, Ning was able to fix on their location and he turned to stare
towards his left. “Both of them are over there.” This freezing
wind howled through the entire area with such intensity that not even
he was able to see to a great distance here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go,” Ning said. He immediately headed off, with Azurefiend
hurriedly following from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooooosh!
Far away from them, a ghostly humanoid figure suddenly manifested out
of thin air within a crevice in the ground. It stared towards Ning’s
direction, followed by its body emanating excited ripples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Outsiders!
More outsiders! Sisters, more outsiders have arrived!” It didn’t
speak at all, it simply used those strange ripples to communicate
with its underground comrades.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
even more streams of energy began to surge from underground, each of
them manifesting into ghostly humanoid figures within the crevice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Two
outsiders have come, sisters!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
eat them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick,
let’s eat them all!” Dozens of the humanoid creatures had
appeared. They all transformed into streams of energy once more,
merging into a single awesome stream of energy that flew like the
wind in Ning’s direction. The surface of this world was covered
with so many gusts of cold wind that they weren’t particularly
noticeable at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Hegemon Azurefiend continued to advance via walking on the
surface of this planet. Ning was extremely careful with each move he
took. He too felt a sense of grave danger as soon as he stepped foot
onto this planet, and he knew that rescuing the Paragon of Pills
would be no easy task. He had to be very careful with this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly turned to glance towards the right, his gaze following
upon a distant stream of energy. This stream of energy seemed to be
identical with the other howling streams of wind energy that filled
this place, but Ning was vaguely able to sense that it was filled
with malevolence, greed, and murder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong, Master?” Hegemon Azurefiend didn’t feel anything yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Freeze!”
Ning barked. His Sword Dao Domain suddenly expanded dramatically,
instantly stretching out to encompass the area where the deadly
stream of energy was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power of his Sword Dao Domain was capable of unleashing a suppressive
effect. The stream of energy instantly trembled, then transformed
into a series of humanoid figures. These creatures weren’t even
able to maintain their ghostly image and thus were forced to reveal
their true appearances. These were fairly short creatures with
grayish-black skin, and their features were fairly handsome… but
the nails growing out of their fingers and toes were as sharp as
knives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Trapped
by the Sword Dao Domain, the grayish-black creatures all let out
agonized shrieks. They struggled fiercely to break free, their claws
dancing in the air as they tried to tear the power surrounding them
apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
these are the legendary ‘vilefiends’, the most commonly seen
creatures within the Sithelands?” Azurefiend was rather excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
They aren’t all that powerful and are the easiest creatures to deal
with here, but for this many to attack at once would still be rather
problematic to deal with.” Ning glanced at the dozens of contorting
vilefiends, then unleashed the power of his Sword Dao Domain with but
a thought. The vilefiends let out ear-piercing screams before their
bodies shattered apart and disappeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vilefiends
were quite unique. They were only able to survive within the
Sithelands; even if you managed to capture one, they would instantly
dissipate once you took them outside of this area!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cultivators
had noticed something special about these creatures. Generally
speaking, the more of them there were in a place, the more dangerous
that place was. Ning had immediately encountered dozens of them as
soon as he had descended upon this sealed planet; this meant there
was an abnormally high concentration of them here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope the situation isn’t as bad as it looks.” Ning felt even more
nervous. The five Autarchs had given Ning extremely detailed maps and
notes pertaining to the Sithelands, and Ning couldn’t help but feel
increasingly worried for the Paragon of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
move fast.” Ning led Azurefiend in advancing towards the other end
of his karma lines at high speeds.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_004__The"></A>
Chapter 4: Daoguard Tower</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Shortly
after Ji Ning’s group walked past this region, the surface of the
ground suddenly became liquid, almost watery. A pair of four-hooved
creatures appeared from underneath the ground. Each creature had a
golden horn atop its head, while their entire bodies was silver in
color. Each was over thirty meters large and extremely muscular. As
for their eyes, they were gray and looked as cold and desolate as
death itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Outsiders
have passed through the territory we control. They are headed in that
direction over there.” The two four-hooved creatures stared towards
the distant Ning and Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
invaders must die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! The two four-hooved creatures charged through the air at
terrifying speeds, moving towards Ning and Azurefiend. They moved far
more quickly than the vast majority of Hegemons, with only the most
powerful Hegemons who reached Hegemony via the Dao of Lightning or
the Dao of Light being able to match up to them in speed. They didn’t
try to disguise themselves at all as they galloped towards Ning’s
group at maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Azurefiend both instantly were able to sense the furious power
which had erupted behind them, and they hurriedly turned to look at
the two streaks of light that had almost reached them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
things?” Ning turned pale. “Silver Goldhorns? Not good!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
The two galloping beasts charged straight towards Ning and
Azurefiend, their eyes filled with the cold remorselessness of death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
instantly felt a chill go down his spine. These two creatures were
definitely capable of killing him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
expanded his Sword Dao Domain, using it to suppress and weaken the
two Silver Goldhorns, but the two were able to continue to charge
forwards while growling angrily. Moments later, streaks of
sword-light began to appear and assault the hooves of those two
silver beasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could these two creatures possibly comprehend or defend against the
marvelousness of Ning’s sword-arts?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thud!
Thud! The two Silver Goldhorns stumbled to the ground after their
hooves came under assault, but they quickly clambered back up. This
time, they chose to fly through the air. Although this resulted in
them being slowed down, they were still able to fly through the
suppressive effects of the Sword Dao Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend.”
Ning waved his hand, tossing out six long black chains. “Hurry up
and bind them. Use these weapons and wait for my signal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” Azurefiend acknowledged. He recognized that these six
black chains were the chains that had previously been used to bind
Flamewing. At the same time, he couldn’t help but feel secretly
shocked that these creatures were actually able to force his Master
to use these chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning was capable of easily defeating these creatures if he
himself attacked, but that would require him to use up some of his
own energy, which meant using up his own lifespan. Thus, unless
absolutely necessary, Ning wanted to avoid using any of his power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaaaar!”
“Kill!” The two Silver Goldhorns continued to charge towards
Ning, who continued to unleash the power of his Sword Dao Domain
against them. Streaks of sword-light shot out in accordance with
Ning’s marvelous sword-arts, allowing him to easily toy with them
and force them to stumble, stagger, and even be knocked backwards.
There was no way for them to approach Ning at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sword-light from Ning’s Sword Dao Domain was capable of slaying
even Hegemons with ease; these were blows comparable to full-strength
strikes from Otherverse Lords. Even though he wasn’t able to kill
the Silver Goldhorns, he was still able to make things incredibly
difficult for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are strengthened by the Daoguard Tower. Although they are strong, in
the end they are nothing more than golems. They have a low level of
insight, making it easy for me to toy with them.” Ning commanded,
“Get ready for my signal to use your chains to trap them and then
pull them away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already bound the chains to myself,” Azurefiend said immediately.
His avatar manifested a total of six arms, each of which held onto
one of the black chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“NOW!
Catch the one on the left!” Ning ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment, the Silver Goldhorn on the left was knocked down as
multiple streams of sword-light converged upon it. Azurefiend
immediately hurled out his black chains, sending them flying through
the air towards the beast. The Silver Goldhorn hurriedly moved to
dodge, but four of the six chains still managed to coil around it and
bind it tightly. It struggled to fight back, but was completely
incapable of breaking free. Soon, it turned limp and stopped
resisting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
chains have a powerful sealing and draining effect. Flamewing has an
almost limitless amount of energy and so the draining meant very
little to it, but the Silver Goldhorns draw their power from the Dao
Protector Hall. There’s a limit to how much energy they can use.”
Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here!” Azurefiend immediately drew the bound Silver Goldhorn
into one of his top-grade Eternal estate-treasures. A short while
later, he retrieved the black chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh.
Master, why is it that the Silver Goldhorn seems to be extremely weak
within my estate-world?” Azurefiend was surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Because
it can no longer sense the Daoguard Tower.” Ning instructed, “Hurry
up and catch the other one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, the tag-team of Ning and Azurefiend captured the
second Silver Goldhorn and drew it into the estate-world as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
a Daoguard Tower?” Azurefiend asked. “Why have I never heard of
it before?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daoguard Tower…” Ning had a rather ugly look on his face. “It
is literally the most dangerous type of location the Sithelands has.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning saw the Silver Goldhorn, his heart had turned cold. He
knew that the situation was even worse than he had thought. Golems
like the Silver Goldhorns were extremely powerful, and they were only
possessed by Daoguard Towers! Now that he knew that this world was
where a Daoguard Tower was located, he knew just how difficult this
journey would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daoguard Tower… as the name implied, it was meant to guard a
certain area. Even beings as powerful as the Sithe needed to train
and cultivate, and so the most powerful Sithe would generally pay
absolutely enormous prices to construct extremely safe, secure, and
stable places where they would live and train. These places were
known as Daoguard Towers! The powerful Sithe would use everything
available to them to reinforce the Daoguard Tower, using it to fight
back against foes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
the most powerful of foes would generally find it very hard to breach
the defenses of a Daoguard Tower, but they did have a weakness –
they were completely immobile!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Sithe Chaosverse, Daoguard Towers were able to draw upon the
natural energies of that Chaosverse. In Ning’s Chaosverse, the
Sithe were unable to do the same, and so they had to first pay an
absolutely enormous price to set up this place, the ‘Sithelands’!
This was a place which held an enormous energy generator within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the Sithe, the ‘Sithelands’ actually served as a ‘miniature’
Chaosverse in many ways. They were able to make use of the energy
generator and then build Daoguard Towers throughout the area. Once
they were built, they could no longer be moved; this was their main
weakness. However, they were tremendously powerful and were perfect
for protecting important locations!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single Daoguard Tower was extremely difficult to deal with, with the
best Daoguard Towers capable of claiming the lives of even the
Autarchs! This was why the Autarchs hadn’t fought their way inside.
Every single Daoguard Tower represented extreme danger! But of
course, they also had a correspondingly great amount of treasure
inside of them. It could be said that Daoguard Towers were literally
built out of a giant mound of treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silver
Goldhorns generally are used to patrol the area outside a Daoguard
Tower and locate enemy intruders,” Ning said. “As soon as we ran
into those Silver Goldhorns, the master of this Daoguard Tower was
probably alerted to our presence as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alerted?”
Azurefiend was worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
In other words, we are now in a great deal of danger.” Ning smiled.
“I might not be able to protect you, in which case your avatar will
be finished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry about me, Master. I would at most lose the materials needed for
an avatar,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
continue.” Ning didn’t waste any more time on words as he led
Azurefiend towards the other end of the karmic lies tying him to Lord
Annihilation and the Paragon of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within the heart of this planet, there was indeed a tower that was
protected by many layers of traps and barriers. This tower had a
total of eight levels to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short creature that was merely one meter tall was seated on an altar
inside the tower. He was a true Sithe, but he merely had the power of
an ordinary Eternal Emperor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short creature opened his eyes, staring at the images which had begun
to appear in front of him. The images displayed two Silver Goldhorns
battling against Ning and Azurefiend. In the end, the two Silver
Goldhorns were captured and taken away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivators?”
The short creature frowned when he saw this. “How odd. Both of
these cultivators are odd. One is a Hegemon, but the white-robed
cultivator with that black sheath… he looks to be a Daolord. In
addition, his truesoul is actually crumbling away, which makes him a
Daolord who has failed the Daomerge. What’s going on? From the
looks of it, the Hegemon is actually subservient to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
what’s with that odd domain? It was able to defeat those Silver
Goldhorns with ease.” The short creature had the feeling that
something was off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
Ever since the barriers were breached, Master slipped away and
ordered me to stand guard over the Daoguard Tower.” The short
creature gritted his teeth, rather unhappy. He had originally been a
mere retainer of this Daoguard Tower’s owner. Once the barrier had
been opened, it was guaranteed that this tower would eventually be
conquered by the cultivators, and so the master of this tower had
fled, leaving him behind to stand guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
how easily they dealt with the Silver Goldhorns, I have to be careful
with them. Hm… yes, I’ll put them in the ‘secondary
dimension’.” The short creature immediately began to activate the
power of the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_005__The"></A>
Chapter 5: Hope of Release</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short creature was unable to disguise the excitement in its eyes.
Each time he took control of the Daoguard Tower and used it to deal
with powerful figures, he felt extremely happy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because if he truly engaged in a ‘fair fight’ against those
powerful cultivators, he would probably be annihilated with ease. But
with the Daoguard Tower at his disposal, he was able to toy with them
instead! By now, this was the only bright spot in his life, the
reason for him to keep living. The Sithe had been defeated, after
all, and his master’s orders meant he had to stay here forever. His
life was one of solitude and despair. If he didn’t have the
occasional bit of entertainment, how could he have possibly been able
to stay alive? His Dao-heart probably would’ve crumbled long ago,
resulting in suicide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
two are the most powerful cultivators I’ve ever encountered. I have
to be careful. They won’t be beaten as easily as other
cultivators.” The short creature took control over the Daoguard
Tower’s powers, watching the scenes of Ji Ning and Azurefiend
advancing at high speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
dealing with the Silver Goldhorns, Ning and Azurefiend continued to
advance at nearly maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that?” Ning soon saw some scattered weapons and armor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
is this connected to the Paragon of Pills’ team?” Azurefiend
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
belonged to their slain comrade.” Ning scanned the area, his gaze
causing time to flow backwards. Soon, Ning was able to see the scene
of the Paragon of Pills, Lord Annihilation, a short, fat old man, and
a silvery-haired woman fight against a total of four Silver
Goldhorns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
four Silver Goldhorns were overwhelmingly powerful. Although the
Paragon of Pills and the others had many tricks up their sleeves,
their techniques were blown away in the very first exchange. The
short and fat old man was the closest to the four and the first to
die, while the other three scattered and fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
four Silver Goldhorns were about to pursue, but all of a sudden they
gave up the pursuit and left. Ning narrowed his eyes. “As I
thought. This Daoguard Tower has someone controlling it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dawn War had ended long ago, and the barrier sealing the Daoguard
Tower had also been breached quite some time ago. Logically speaking,
the powerful Sithe who owned this Daoguard Tower had probably slipped
away long ago, and so Ning had harbored the faint hope that this
Daoguard Tower was now unmanned! However, he knew that even if the
Sithe who owned this tower had fled, he might’ve arranged for a
servant or a golem to control it in his stead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that the chances of this Daoguard Tower being unmanned were
slim… and now, his hopes were crushed entirely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope the controller of this Daoguard Tower is a wise man.” Ning
shook his head slightly, then waved his hand and collected the armor
and weapons lying on the ground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
where should we go next?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
odd.” Ning suddenly frowned. “The Mistress and Annihilation
clearly fled in two different directions. Why, then, are my karmic
senses indicating that they are in the same region right now?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
me.” Ning trusted his karmic senses, and so led Azurefiend in a
high-speed advance towards the Paragon’s location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Ning came to a sudden halt because a series of
ripples had appeared in the air before him. The world around him was
beginning to twist and contort as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master
of the Daoguard Tower,” Ning said with a frown, his voice echoing
within the world around him, “I am simply adventuring in this place
and do not intend to enter the Daoguard Tower itself! There is no
need for us to fight against each other.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ehehehe…”
A low, hoarse laugh rang out and echoed within the air around Ning.
“What a formidable Daolord. I am truly rather mystified by you! But
this is my territory. Now that you have dared to trespass here, your
fate is under my control. Ehehehe… but let’s not be impatient! We
have plenty of time. Let’s take it slow and have some fun
together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
this about those two Silver Goldhorns? I can give them back to you,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
Once I capture you, they’ll become mine again regardless. All the
treasures you carry shall be mine! Even you yourself, you diverting
Daolord, shall become mine.” The voice was filled with a hint of
wicked glee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face hardened slightly. He barked coldly, “So you are a madman. It
seems you’ve been alone for so long you’ve gone insane.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoguard
Towers were used by powerful Sithe to protect their lairs. Generally
speaking, so long as you didn’t try to attack the towers they
similarly wouldn’t expend too much effort in attacking you! This
was why Ning had tried to be fairly low-key and hadn’t caused too
many problems. He had come here to rescue his friends, not to defeat
the Daoguard Tower! He had thought that if he didn’t cause a fuss
and didn’t infringe upon the Daoguard Tower itself and threaten its
controller, the controller wouldn’t start a life-and-death fight
against him. Clearly, he was wrong. The controller of this Daoguard
Tower was a madman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
madman by himself wasn’t that frightening, but the Daoguard Tower
was!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eheheh…
no one who has come here has ever been able to escape and survive.
You won’t escape either.” As the voice fell silent, the
surrounding dimensional ripples quickly began to reach out towards
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master?”
Azurefiend was a bit worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
done playing nice!” Ning’s face hardened and a sharp look flashed
through his eyes. “Sword Dao Domain!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
countless blades of sword-light appeared throughout this entire
planet. Clearly, Ning had just expanded his Sword Dao Domain to an
incredible size, using it to cover the entire planet!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Suppress!”
Ning held nothing back at all. In the past, he had kept his Sword Dao
Domain reigned in to cover a fairly small area because he didn’t
wish to cause too much of a problem with the master of the Daoguard
Tower… but since they were already at loggerheads, he wasn’t
going to show any mercy at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the terrifying Sword Dao Domain instantly crashed down, bringing a
terrifying amount of power against everything within this planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit!”
The short creature within the Daoguard Tower instantly turned pale,
and his eyes became filled with both terror and excitement. His body
began to quiver. “This is the domain of an Eternal Omega Sword Dao!
Ahaha, it’s actually an Eternal Omega Sword Dao! All my defenses
have to hold!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
series of membrane-like barriers appeared across the surface of this
entire planet, each of which covered part of the planet in an
interlocking way. Thus, when the membranes rose together, they were
able to block off all of the sword-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daoguard Tower’s energies are being depleted at an incredible
rate.” The short creature was rather nervous. Defending against
this much sword-light was consuming power from the Daoguard Tower at
a shocking rate, but Ning’s Sword Dao Domain drew energy from the
power of the Dao itself; in other words, it drew from the power of
the Chaosverse! Its energies were limitless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a different part of this planet, where space and time were both
distorted. The Paragon of Pills, dressed in black gauze, was seated
in the lotus position within a field of light. Ever since she had
been trapped here, she assumed the lotus position and didn’t move
around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
still haven’t been able to see through the secrets hidden behind
this place. The more I move about, the closer I will be to death.”
The Paragon of Pills weighed the area around her with her gaze. She
had traversed many places in the Sithelands and had quite a bit of
experience in this regard. She was also extremely patient and had
reached extremely high levels in the Dao of Karma, the Dao of
Formations, and the Dao of Spacetime. Thus, in most places she was
usually able to discover the mysteries behind the various traps and
then escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why she had reached such high levels of skill in these Daos
was because she knew she would have to rely on them and herself to
revive her departed brothers. She had invested enormous amounts of
effort into studying spacetime and karma, and they had become her
secret weapons in ensuring that she was able to survive her trips
into the Sithelands. Otherwise, she would’ve died long ago in one
of her crazy expeditions here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, the entire field of light around her shook violently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The Paragon of Pills lifted her head to stare into the skies. She
could sense that outside the field of blurry light, there were two
enormous surges of power that were clashing against each other. Both
powers were so vast as to cause her to feel shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
it be Darknorth?” The Paragon of Pills had a rather complicated
look on her face. Her avatar was alongside Lord Annihilation’s
avatar, and so she knew that Lord Annihilation had gone against her
will and asked Ning to come save them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Either
we stop now, or we continue until you are gone.” Ning’s voice was
cold, and it rang out throughout the entire world. The walls of
rippling spacetime around him blocked out his senses, but he knew
that the Daoguard Tower had to be using up an enormous amount of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
now? Ahahaha! Go ahead and try to attack the Daoguard Tower. Just try
to kill me! Hah! If you can’t, you’ll be the one to die! Did you
really think you are able to contend against me, puny cultivator?
Besides, if I can take out someone who is in control of the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao, my death would have been worth it!” The short
creature had never felt this berserk before, because everyone in his
own Chaosverse who was in control of an Eternal Omega Dao would have
an extremely high status that was far superior to that of the
Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because Emperors who mastered an Eternal Omega Dao were on par
with ordinary Autarchs in might, but the Autarchs had reached the end
of the road; there was no way for them to become any more powerful.
Omega Emperors, however, still had a chance to take one more step and
become Omega Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
local Chaosverse was a weak one, and its cultivators were barbaric…
which meant that for them, a cultivator who mastered an Eternal Omega
Dao would only be even more important!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you were a true Emperor, I would probably stand no chance at all.
However, your truesoul is crumbling, which means I have a chance to
kill you.” The short creature had gone completely berserk, because
he knew that if he managed to kill an Eternal Omega Sword Dao
wielder, he would have rendered incredible merits to his side. Even
if he died, his truesoul would return to his homeland, at which point
he would almost certainly be revived and brought back to life for his
efforts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had thought that his only choice was to await death, that there was
no longer any hope in his life… that toying with impudent
trespassing cultivators was the only thing left. But now? Now he saw
hope, hope of release!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!
Dimensional Separator!” The short creature no longer chose to be as
cautious as he was at the start. His eyes filled with madness, he
immediately used a vicious technique that had a serious backlash
effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly felt as though this entire planet had suddenly been split
apart like a watermelon. It was separated into two parts, which was
then separated into hundreds of different parts! The area he was in
was just one ‘shard’ of the watermelon, a shard that was in a
completely different dimensional continuum that had been completely
locked away, trapping himself and Azurefiend within.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_006__The"></A>
Chapter 6: They Meet</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
I’ve chosen to fight, I’m going to use everything I have and give
him no chance at all.” The short creature’s eyes were filled with
madness. He knew just how terrifying someone who controlled an
Eternal Omega Dao could be! Even his master, the original owner of
this Daoguard Tower, was far from being a match for Ji Ning. In their
own Chaosverse, this short creature would probably never even be
given the chance to meet such an august personage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
precisely because he knew just how fearsome Ning could be, he
immediately attacked with all his power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, he’s someone who has failed his Daomerge. Sands of Time,
arise!” The short creature held nothing back at all, immediately
using yet another one of the Daoguard Tower’s killer techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Spots
of sparkling, sand-like grains of light instantly flew out of the
Daoguard Tower, falling under the spacetime dominion of the tower
which synchronized it with and sent it into the sealed dimension
which Ning and Azurefiend were trapped in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
for the killing blow. Charge to the maximum power!” The short
creature gritted his teeth, and the very tip of the Daoguard Tower
suddenly began to light up as a large amount of energy began to
gather together there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, this entire planet had been separated into hundreds of sealed
dimensional pockets, with Ning and Azurefiend being trapped in one of
them. Azurefiend was starting to panic a bit, because he could sense
an enormous amount of danger, as though he could die at any moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
go into my estate-world for now.” Ning waved his hand, pulling
Azurefiend into his estate. He then scanned his surroundings. “What
a vicious technique… he’s actually willing to destroy his own
territory for the sake of killing me! What the hell? Why does he hate
me so much? This is the first time we’ve ever met.” Ning couldn’t
help but feel puzzled at how viciously his opponent was behaving. His
opponent’s very first act was to destroy the very world which the
Daoguard Tower had been created to protect. The world itself had also
served as an additional defensive layer for the Daoguard Tower. Now
the world was gone; the only thing left was the tower itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was clearly a technique which was dangerous to both the user and the
target. Generally speaking, most people wouldn’t use such a
powerful, double-edged technique until things truly grew desperate.
Still, the technique was indeed powerful; not even Ning’s Sword Dao
Domain was capable of breaking through a completely sealed dimension
like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clink.
Ning drew a Northbow sword from the sheath on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooooosh!
Just as Ning was about to use his sword to chop apart this cage of
sealed spacetime, the entire region suddenly rippled with rainbow
light that twisted time wherever the light appeared. In some places,
time sped up a million times over; in other places, it froze
completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face hardened. “The Sands of Time?” The Sands of Time was yet
another type of treasure the Sithe had access to, and it was
described in great detail in the records which the Autarchs had given
Ning. This type of treasure was extremely dangerous when used against
most cultivators, but against Ning it was absolutely lethal!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
activated, it was possible that time would be frozen for the upper
half of your body, while time would be accelerated a trillionfold for
the lower half of your body. This sort of temporal twisting would
cause ordinary Emperors and Hegemons incredible discomfort during
battle, lessening their combat prowess… but Ning wasn’t an
Emperor, he was a Daolord whose truesoul was breaking apart. His
truesoul could very well collapse and die from this!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
first destroyed his own territory, then used the Sands of Time…
just to kill me?” Ning had no time to think. He immediately sent a
serious, horizontal chop towards the space in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
blow from his sword seemed to have enough power to completely sever
apart everything in Heaven and Earth. The passage of the sword-light
was followed by a tiny thread of water, but a heartbeat later the
thread of water transformed into a raging river, and then into a
titanic wave. Endless waves of sword-light crashed through the skies
with absolutely terrifying power, completely overwhelming the
onslaught of the Sands of Time and sweeping through all of the
rainbow light!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
terrifying sword-intent had completely submerged and annihilated the
Sands of Time. This was Ning’s Water Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
destroying the Sands of Time, the wave of sword-light was
dramatically weakened as well, but it still continued to sweep
forwards and crash against the dimensional membrane of this sealed
space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The entire region shuddered violently, as a large amount of cracks
began to appear at the margins of this space, both in the skies and
deep underground. The cracks spread out like ripples, while Ning
stood at the center of the region and watched carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
thought that strike would’ve been enough to annihilate both the
Sands of Time and this pocket dimension I’m in. It seems I didn’t
put enough power into that strike. This dimensional pocket is more
stable than I thought,” Ning mused. He was extremely miserly with
his energies right now, and would hold back power whenever necessary
without overusing even the slightest amount.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go.”
Ning stabbed out with his Northbow sword once more. This time, he
himself transformed into a streak of sword-light that shot outwards.
The tip of the sword-light was Ning’s Northbow sword, and it easily
pierced through the crumbling dimensional seal and appeared outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the instant that he broke through the dimensional membrane, Ning was
able to see the hundreds of dimensional shards that hung in the air
like lonely little islands. At the very center, there was a clearly
visible eight-story tower that was sitting on a foundation of earth
that was millions of kilometers in size. The ground was covered with
countless runes and ley-lines, allowing it to serve as the foundation
of this tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Daoguard Towers were immobile and had to be
anchored somewhere. Through the foundation it was anchored to, it was
able to maintain contact with and draw power from the energy
generator fueling the entire Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that…” Ning instantly saw the dazzling light building at the very
tip of the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!
DIE!” Spittle was flying out of the mouth of the short creature
within the Daoguard Tower, and his eyes were completely deranged. The
Dimensional Separator and the Sands of Time were two of his killer
weapons, capable of slaying even ordinary Otherverse Lords with ease.
The Sands of Time in particular should’ve been a perfect counter
for a Daolord whose truesoul was crumbling, but it had still ended up
failing. He had never fought someone like this before, after all…
but everything was as he had expected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIIIIIIIE!”
the short creature howled hoarsely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The light on the top of the Daoguard Tower suddenly shot out, moving
at an absolutely terrifying speed. Ning was roughly a billion
kilometers away from the Daoguard Tower; given the short distance and
the incredible speed of the attack, not even Otherverse Lords would
be able to dodge in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
Ning suddenly transformed into a streak of electric light that moved
with equally terrifying speed. He was able to dodge the attack with
ease and then charged straight towards the tower. As for the attack,
it shot past the location Nng had been in and then continued on to
pass through the distant black fog behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
dodged it?!” The short creature was both angry and anxious. “He’s
too fast. He’s too strong and he’s too fast!” He wanted to kill
Ning and then be rewarded for it; this was his only chance of
salvation! Alas… the only tool he had available to him was the
Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
too fast and his sword-arts are too furious. There’s no way I can
kill him at long range,” the short creature mused. “I’ll wait
for him to come inside. Once he actually enters the Daoguard tower,
I’ll unleash all of the Daoguard Tower’s powers at the same time.
He’s a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge. He HAS to die from
that!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
farther away two fighters were, the more difficult it would be for
one to kill the other. Daoguard Towers were built with layers of
defenses. They had roving patrols to keep invaders at a distance,
ranged attacks to deal with those who made it past the patrols, and
also self-destruct options meant to take out invaders who made it
into close range.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he couldn’t help but sigh to himself. “The records
indicate that the closer you get to a Daoguard Tower, the more
dangerous it is, with the insides of the tower being the most
dangerous of all. I’ve been quite far away from it, but it was
still able to force me to use power thrice.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first time was when he used his sword to break through the Sands of
Time. The remaining power hadn’t been enough to break through the
sealed dimension. He used a fair amount of power in this strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second time had been when he pierced through the sealed dimension and
fled, while the third time had been when he used an evasion-art to
dodge that strike. He had used up very little power here, with the
evasion-art using up the least.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I really wanted to break into the Daoguard Tower, I’d probably have
to use several times as much energy. In fact, I could well die
there,” Ning muttered to himself. He once more turned to follow his
karmic senses, quickly using his karmic lines to locate the Paragon
of Pills. He immediately turned towards one of the hundreds of sealed
dimensions. Now that the entire world had been shattered, he was able
to find her with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Mistress is located in that region over there.” Ning was certain of
it. As for Lord Annihilation, he was located in another dimensional
pocket that was quite close to her’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Ning was able to move at incredible speeds when transformed into a
streak of electric sword-light. In fact, he was a bit faster than
when he had first mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao. He instantly
appeared in front of the sealed dimensional continuum where the
Paragon of Pills was located, then delivered a blow with his Northbow
sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The sword-light carved a giant gaping hole within the sealed pocket
that was thousands of meters long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had no choice but to do this. These sealed dimensions were so strong
and stable that he wasn’t going to be able to breach them unless he
used his sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Through
the gaping hole, he was able to clearly see what was inside that
dimension. He saw a cold, austere-looking woman dressed in black
gauze who was seated in the lotus position. No matter how calm and
collected the woman normally was, she was unable to prevent a look of
shock from appearing on her face as she turned to stare at the
white-robed youth standing behind the gaping hole in the dimensional
wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth?”
She recognized this youth right away.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_007__The"></A>
Chapter 7: Playtime is Over</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the only disciple her big brother had ever taken. In her heart,
Ji Ning was arguably more important than even her own disciples. She
had always felt that Darknorth was someone she had to protect… but
somehow, without her even realizing it, the kid had grown up. She had
received word that the kid had grown to become an absolutely
incredible figure, slaying the Lonely King with just a blow of his
sword. How unbelievable was this?! She was absolutely delighted to
know that her big brother had taken in a truly remarkable disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
today… the young fellow had appeared before her once more, rescuing
her from her plight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mistress,
let’s hurry up and get out of here!” Ning sent mentally. At the
same time, he sent out his Sword Dao Domain to ‘plug’ the gap,
preventing it from healing. The Sword Dao Domain was unable to tear
through the dimensional seal, but it was able to dramatically slow
down the healing process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The Paragon of Pills rose to her feet, a smile on her face as she
transformed into a streak of light and flew out of the dimensional
tear. As she did so, she cast a radiant and joyful smile towards
Ning. For some reason, she felt even happier than she would’ve if
it was her own disciple who had reached such a level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was vaguely able to sense that we would meet again, but I never
would’ve imagined that the circumstances would be you rescuing me.”
The Paragon laughed. “I rather thought that it would be the other
way around.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense how happy the Paragon of Pills was. He was quite happy as
well. There weren’t that many people who truly treated him as
family, but the Paragon of Pills was definitely one of them. In fact,
Ning could sense from the Paragon of Pills a sort of motherly love
that reminded him of the love which his true mother Yuchi Snow bore
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mistress,
you seem quite calm and relaxed. I’ve been worried sick over you!
Thankfully, you are alright.” Ning let out a sigh of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
always danger when adventuring through Sithe ruins. I’ve been in
situations like this on multiple occasions,” the Paragon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
this place is different. There is a Daoguard Tower here!” Ning
couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear. There was no way the
Paragon of Pills or any of the others would’ve been able to flee on
their own. A double-edged technique like the Dimensional Separator,
which had completely shattered the planet apart and divided it up
into many different pocket dimensions, were powerful enough to slay
even Otherverse Lords… and that was just one of many techniques the
Daoguard Tower had access to!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daoguard
Tower? What’s a Daoguard Tower?” The Paragon of Pills was rather
puzzled, but she hurriedly said, “Let’s not waste any time,
Darknorth. This place is extremely dangerous. Let’s leave right
away. If you can save my two companions, you should do so; if you
cannot, don’t try to force it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
rescue them, but they need to wait a bit.” Ning smiled
mysteriously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">…….</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short creature stared at the images of the outside world, puzzled.
The white-robed Daolord had easily dodged his attack, then
immediately moved to another sealed dimension and used his sword to
slice through the dimensional membrane. He had rescued the woman who
had been trapped inside that dimensional pocket, and the two clearly
seemed quite happy to meet each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
came here to save his friends?” The short creature was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning let out a happy laugh, then led the Paragon of Pills in
transforming into streaks of light that flew off towards the horizon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
They are leaving?!” The short creature was stunned. His original
plan had been to wait until Ning attacked the Daoguard Tower, then
continue his own assaults. His hope was that Ning would actually
enter the tower!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
now… Ning did the exact opposite. After locating the Paragon of
Pills, he had immediately moved to depart. Ning had gained a thorough
understanding of the Daoguard Tower from the Autarchs; he obviously
wasn’t going to be foolish enough to charge into the Daoguard Tower
when he already knew how deadly it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a result, the short creature’s ‘perfect plan’ came to nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
you really think you could just leave whenever you wanted?” The
short creature was completely berserk. This represented his only
chance of escape and release. Even though his chances were slim, he
was still going to use all his power to fight for it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Triple
Dimensional Hallway Chains!” The creature ranted in a crazed
manner, “All Silver Goldhorns, move out and trap them! Daoguard
Tower, release the seals and unleash those monsters!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Upon
seeing that Ning was about to leave, the short creature finally
unleashed all the tools at his disposal! There were some traps he was
unable to use as Ning hadn’t moved closer towards him, but he had
fully unleashed everything else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ji Ning led the Paragon of Pills in departing, he sent mentally to
her: “That eight-storied tower is known as a Daoguard Tower, a
truly terrifying Sithe guard tower. I’m unwilling to actually enter
it, but it seems as though the tower’s master is hellbent on
killing me. Now that I’m ‘leaving’, he’ll probably grow a bit
anxious. Let’s see what he tries to pull.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as his words finished, Ning’s eyes widened. “What the…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Daoguard Tower began to rumble menacingly as the entire thing
began to tremble and crack apart like a turtle shell. Even the
enormous foundation beneath it was beginning to split apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
overwhelming power of the Daoguard Tower spread throughout every
pocket dimension surrounding it. The pocket dimensions that had
previously hovered around it like little islands suddenly began to
shoot out in every direction, forming a series of dimensional
membrane walkways. The only things Ning could see in front of him
were those dimensional walkways; he could no longer see the outside
world at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to glance backwards at the Daoguard Tower, which was now
filled with innumerable cracks. “He’s wrecking the Daoguard
Tower?” Ning could hardly believe it. “Even the foundation is
splitting apart!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
foundation was the most important part of the Daoguard Tower, but
even it was beginning to break apart! Ning could tell how
terrifyingly determined the Daoguard Tower’s controller was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
series of thunderous roars rang out, followed by Silver Goldhorns
charging out of the various dimensional islands. They were completely
unimpeded by the pocket dimensions, coming in threes and fives as
they charged towards Ning. All in all, there was a total of
sixty-five of the creatures!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
just that. Two creatures that looked like stone pythons suddenly came
flying out of the crumbling Daoguard Tower. When the two stone
pythons first flew out, they were quite small, but they quickly
expanded in size to many tens of thousands of kilometers long. They
were completely formed from stone, and their eyes were a dull gray
color. They radiated an aura of life, but their eyes were completely
dead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are clearly alive, but they don’t seem to be sentient at all?”
Ning was rather shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
can you handle it? Do you need me to help?” The Paragon of Pills
couldn’t help but feel nervous when she saw the sixty-five Silver
Goldhorns swarming towards them. Her original team had been instantly
defeated by four Silver Goldhorns, and so she knew that every single
one of them was capable of battling an Otherverse Lord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was said that the most dangerous Sithe bases were the ones which held
Daoguard Towers, and the number of Silver Goldhorns this place held
was proof of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why the cultivators had been unwilling to actually attack these
places during the Dawn War. They had lured the Sithe into the outside
world, ensuring that the strongest Sithe bases were taken out of the
equation. Only then did they manage to win and decimate the Sithe
forces. Only after doing so did they attack the Sithelands, but even
then they had only been able to successfully breach the outer
perimeter. As for the Daoguard Towers in the outer perimeter, they
had merely sealed them away rather than actually assault them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry.” Ning let out a chuckle as he released his Sword Dao Domain,
causing countless streaks of sword-light to fill the entire area and
begin to assault the Silver Goldhorns. The Silver Goldhorns began to
stumble, stagger, or even be knocked backwards. There was no way for
them to close in on Ning at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the two stone serpents, they were slowed down by the Sword Dao
Domain but they still managed to move closer towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
Clack! Clack! The foundation of the Daoguard Tower splintered apart.
Ning cast the shattered foundation a glance. The Daoguard Tower had
always given him a sense of danger. Now that the foundation had
shattered, he felt that the danger level was actually rising.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
massive creature was slowly beginning to arise from within the vast,
shattered foundation. Her body was unmistakably massive, nearly a
hundred thousand kilometers in size. This creature had the lower body
of a centipede but the upper body of a humanoid female. The
nagapede’s face was beautiful and her eyes were shut, and as the
foundation and its barriers crumbled around her, the power within her
body began to skyrocket.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
slowly opened her eyes. At first, there was a lost look in her eyes,
but it was quickly replaced with endless malevolence. She opened her
mouth, unleashing an earth-shaking roar of terrifying power that
spread out in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short creature within the cracked Daoguard Tower stared at the
distant Ning, his eyes filled with madness. “Now that I’ve
destroyed the Daoguard Tower and released the monster beneath it,
I’ll die… but you will die as well. This entire region has been
locked by three levels of dimensional walkway chains. You won’t be
able to escape. You’ll have to fight… and if you do, you failed
Daolord, you won’t be able to withstand her power. You’ll die in
battle, and the glory shall go to me! Ahahah!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
As the short creature laughed wildly, his body suddenly disintegrated
as the shockwave from the nagapede’s earth-shaking roar washed past
it, destroying even some of the weapons he was carrying before
continuing to blast outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
Ning turned slightly pale when he saw this. As for the Paragon of
Pills, she was completely terrified by this display of power. “Such
power!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t expect that I would be so ‘lucky’ as to encounter
something like this in my very first Daoguard Tower.” Ning had a
solemn look on his face. He had learned many secrets from the
Autarchs, and so he knew exactly what this creature which had been
imprisoned beneath the Daoguard Tower was.</P>

Chapter 8: The Nagapede</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
shockwave from the roar blasted outwards from the vast creature,
causing space itself to tremble and shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
roar alone was capable of heavily injuring Hegemons, but it was still
a bit weaker than Ji Ning’s Sword Dao Domain. Long before it even
got close to Ning, it was blocked off by those endless streams of
sword-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is that freak?” the Paragon of Pills asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Many
dangerous areas in the Sithelands have been sealed off, and some of
those areas are places with Daoguard Towers,” Ning said. “Daoguard
Towers vary in power; there’s obviously no way that a Hegemon’s
Daoguard Tower would be as strong as an Exalt’s Daoguard Tower.
This Daoguard Tower we ran into wasn’t all that strong; the owner
definitely wasn’t a Sithe Exalt. However, all Daoguard Towers
contain a multitude of attacks, ranging from long-distance strikes,
traps to capture foes, close-range attacks, and a final kamikaze
attack.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
kamikaze attack?” The Paragon of Pills was surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
example, this Daoguard Tower was used to suppress a creature known as
a nagapede,” Ning said with a laugh. “Even back during the Dawn
War, our side only encountered a total of nineteen such creatures. I
didn’t expect to run into one of them today.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was quite rare for a Daoguard Tower to be hiding such a powerful
creature beneath it, which was why Ning had mocked himself as being
‘lucky’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs and the cultivator civilizations all lived in a single
enormous celestial entity known as their ‘Chaosverse’, while the
Sithe hailed from a different Chaosverse. Chaosverses were the
largest celestial bodies in the Infinite Void, but the Void did hold
some other creatures within it as well. On the whole, these creatures
were generally less intelligent than beings who lived within the
Chaosverses, as only the vitality of a Chaosverse could give rise to
truly perfect beings and the incredible figures who would become the
Lords of Chaos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
creatures who lived within the Infinite Void were somewhat inferior…
but many of them were born with incredible strength! However, their
low level of intelligence made it easy for them to be manipulated and
made use of. The Autarchs had once slain two strange creatures who
were comparable to Autarchs in power. Both of them came from the
Infinite Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the Sithe invaded Ning’s Chaosverse, they not only lost the benefit
of having the Dao empower their strikes, they were also suppressed by
the ‘foreign’ Chaosverse itself! This was why the local
cultivators were able to make their invasion so difficult. But in the
Infinite Void? There, they weren’t strengthened by the Dao but also
weren’t suppressed. As a result, they were much more powerful and
able to capture many of the strange beings which lived in the Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
creature is fairly powerful. It is probably on par with Sithe
Exalts,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
par with Sithe Exalts? What are we supposed to do, then?” A look of
worry appeared on the Paragon’s face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
it to me,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
titanic creature’s lower centipede-body slithered forward slightly,
its giant head focused straight towards the area Ning was in. The
Silver Goldhorns, Ning, and the Paragon of Pills were all there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!
Kill! Kill!” the nagapede growled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
you tell me your name?” Ning said, his voice transmitting directly
into the ears of the creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nagapede stared back at Ning with a savage, maddened look in her
eyes. Suddenly, she let out a fierce howl and shot forwards, her
centipede-like body scuttling forwards like a crawling streak of
light that shot straight towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yet
another one which has been driven mad. Many of these creatures caught
by the Sithe end up being driven mad by them.” Ning shook his head.
These powerful creatures weren’t very intelligent, but they were at
least comparable to ordinary mortal adults. This one, however, was
more like a madman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
She scuttled forwards at incredible speeds. Ning and the Paragon of
Pills were far away, with countless streams of sword-light barring
the nagapede’s path towards them. Thus, she turned her attention
towards the Silver Goldhorns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!
Kill! Kill!” She flew next to the nearest Silver Goldhorn, then
reached out towards it. Her giant alabaster fingers took a firm grip
over the Silver Goldhorn, which howled and struggled fiercely. Alas,
it was like a toy that had been firmly gripped by a pair of alabaster
pincers. The nagapede clenched her fingers, causing cracks to appear
throughout the surface of the Silver Goldhorn’s body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
Clack! Clack! BOOM! The Silver Goldhorn was crushed to death!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised an eyebrow when he saw this. “She’s strong.” The Sithe
had brought only the most terrifyingly powerful creatures they had
found and enslaved in the Infinite Void outside the Chaosverse. Every
single one of these creatures possessed absolutely apocalyptic levels
of power. Judging from the clench, this nagapede was clearly much
stronger than even the Flamewing God. She might be able to rival even
the Sithe Exalts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!
Kill!” She continued to growl this single word as she reached out
once more, her fingers moving like a blur to latch onto yet another
Silver Goldhorn. Her long, slender white fingers once more clenched
tightly, shattering that second Silver Goldhorn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
was going to kill and destroy everything she saw. By now, she no
longer had any clarity of mind; she had gone completely mad. In fact,
she had been driven mad and transformed into a creature that only
lived for murder even before she had been sealed away by the Daoguard
Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Poor
woman.” Ning watched silently from afar as he continued to use his
sword-light to keep the Silver Goldhorns at bay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Some of the Silver Goldhorns began to flee, but the Sword
Dao Domain gave them nowhere to run. Ning drove each and every one of
them towards the nagapede, which crushed all of them! There was no
point in him subduing and collecting them, after all, to this very
day, the cultivators were still unable to find a method for
controlling the Silver Goldhorns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crunch!
Crunch! Crunch! One of the stone pythons was captured by the
nagapede, which latched onto it with both hands and tugged at it
fiercely to no avail. The nagapede then lowered her head to bite the
stone python. CRUNCH! This time, the stone python was broken into two
halves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
roughly the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, all of the Silver
Goldhorns and both of the stone pythons had been slain by the titanic
nagapede. As for Ning, thus far he had merely maintained his Sword
Dao Domain without actually exchanging blows against the creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
The nagapede focused her full attention upon the distant Ning and the
Paragon of Pills. They were the only living creatures left in the
region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mistress,
please enter my estate-world for a short while,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon knew that she couldn’t afford to be a distraction to Ning.
She immediately said, “Be careful.” This was definitely the most
terrifying creature she had ever seen. She had thought that the
Silver Goldhorns were tough, but this giant ‘nagapede’ had
crushed them like bugs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry.” Ning waved his hand, collecting the Paragon into his
estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!
KILL! KILL!!!” the titanic nagapede howled, charging towards Ning.
There was simply no way for the Sword Dao Domain to hold her back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Ning drew a Northbow sword, then murmured softly to himself, “I
hope I’m lucky enough to be able to get rid of her within three
strikes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant nagapede scuttled forwards towards Ning, emanating an aura of
earth-shaking power that was far more baleful than even the Blazesun
Ruler’s. In the Infinite Void outside the Chaosverses, she had
annihilated an entire celestial body in just this manner. She
definitely stood at the very apex of power amongst the creatures that
resided in the Infinite Void, but upon being captured she had been
converted into an insane beast that lived for slaughter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unfortunately
for Ning, being in this Chaosverse hadn’t lessened her power at
all! This was because her power came from her own body, rather than
the power of the Dao. As a result, there was virtually no difference
in power between when she was in the Infinite Void and when she was
in a Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
A streak of dazzling golden sword-light appeared, swiping forwards in
a completely unblockable manner. It pierced straight into the titanic
nagapede’s body, which was unable to impede it despite being
extremely tough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! Sword-light appeared a total of six times inside of her
body. Finally, she trembled and her eyes turned dim. Her gigantic
body quickly began to shrink as it came to a halt in midair. A streak
of light flew out from the injury to her chest. It was Ning, Northbow
sword in hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
had to attack a total of six times before I was able to land a fatal
blow.” Clink! Ning resheathed the Northbow sword back into the
scabbard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Every
part of this creature is an absolute treasure and has many uses.”
Ning waved his hand, pulling the giant body of the nagapede into his
estate-world. Next, he released Azurefiend and the Paragon of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
just now I believe I saw the nagapede’s corpse appear within your
estate-world.” The Paragon of Pills had a look of surprise and
delight on her face when she appeared. She immediately inspected Ning
carefully. “You disposed of it quite quickly. It seems you truly
have reached an unfathomable level of power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
ago, the Autarchs informed me of the weak spots these creatures
possess. That made it much easier for me to deal with this one,”
Ning said. Only a fool would’ve engaged the creature in a ‘proper’
battle. These creatures all had weak spots inside their bodies, but
their outer shells were so tough that only Ning and the Autarchs were
able to dispose of them with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
short creature who had been in control of the Daoguard Tower had
hoped that the powerful creature would be able to exhaust Ning and
cause his death in such a manner. In truth, he couldn’t be blamed
for this belief. Amongst the Sithe, he was a low status servant who
had never before encountered a Daolord who had failed the Daomerge
yet was in control of an Eternal Omega Dao. He was operating on
guesswork when he believed that the nagapede would be able to exhaust
Ning, and indeed if Ning knew nothing at all about the nagapede then
she really would’ve proven to be rather troublesome. The nagapede
had been the short creature’s only hope of dealing with Darknorth…
but it had fallen far short.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
is it time to rescue Annihilation?” the Paragon of Pills asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
just yet. Right now, it’ll be quite hard to break through those
dimensions to rescue them,” Ning said. The sealed dimensions had
been rearranged to form the Dimensional Hallway Chains, which were
extremely difficult to break through. “These dimensions were all
extremely stable because they drew power from the Daoguard Tower. Now
that the Daoguard Tower has been destroyed, they will be like rivers
which are running dry. They won’t be able to replenish any of the
energy which they have used up. Eventually, they’ll transform back
into ordinary space which can be torn through with ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now…
let’s go take a look at what’s inside the ruins of the Daoguard
Tower.” As Ning spoke, he began to fly towards the shattered
remnants of the toppled Daoguard Tower.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_009__The"></A>
Chapter 9: Sweeping the Loot</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning, the Paragon of Pills, and Azurefiend flew over together. All
eight floors of the tower had already crumbled apart, with the
shattered remnants of the tower forming a pile of rubble atop a
foundation of dirt that hovered there in space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
why is it that the Daoguard Tower crumbled without you even attacking
it?” The Paragon of Pills was puzzled. “I distinctly remember
that it collapsed on its own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Daoguard Tower wasn’t all that strong; I expect that its owner was
just a Hegemon,” Ning said. “It would be too difficult for him to
personally subdue a nagapede like that, and so he used the entire
Daoguard Tower to keep it sealed and suppressed! So long as the tower
was in good shape, the creature would be unable to break free… but
once the tower began to crumble, the nagapede would appear and
massacre everything around it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
if this was an Exalt’s Daoguard Tower, we really would’ve been in
much more trouble.” Ning let out a sigh. “Still, we’re merely
in the outer perimeter of the Sithelands. Almost all of the Daoguard
Towers owned by Sithe Exalts are located in the heartland.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe heartland?” The Paragon said, “I’ve visited the
Sithelands on many occasions. I could sense that spacetime was in a
state of complete disorder and that there were many places that were
unexplored.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
places were never meant for cultivators to challenge,” Ning said.
Very few knew the true details and secrets behind the Dawn War. The
Paragon of Pills naturally didn’t know the secrets either. Yes, she
had learned a few things thanks to her crazy, repeated adventures
within the Sithelands, but the heartland was a place which not even
the Autarchs would dare trespass lightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
as Ning flew towards the toppled tower, his Sword Dao Domain rippled
outwards, brushing away the pieces of rubble as he closely inspected
the remains of the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this is a fun little toy.” Ning removed a dark red globe which had
been affixed to one of the top floors. This globe was the object
which had unleashed that terrifying attack of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
it accumulates and stores enough energy, it can unleash an attack of
incredible power.” Ning chuckled. “This is a decent Sithe weapon,
Mistress. Azurefiend, help me search through the rubble. I want to
sweep this place clean.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh, my pleasure! Master, perhaps you would be willing to bestow some
of the treasures you are uninterested in upon me,” Azurefiend said,
a look of utter shamelessness on his wizened old features.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Depends
on my mood.” Ning chuckled. He wasn’t just going to give this
shameless old man what he wanted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
never encountered a Daoguard Tower before. In fact, I’ve never even
heard of it before you mentioned it.” The Paragon of Pills was
filled with curiosity as well. The dangers she had experienced here,
especially the terrifying nagapede, had all served to ensure that she
understood that this site was very different from the other Sithe
ruins she had visited in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
previous ruins she had scoured had been unoccupied. This time, she
ran into one with a controller. If it hadn’t been for Ning, she
truly would’ve been doomed this time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Bang! Rip! Ning, Azurefiend, and the Paragon of Pills happily
dismantled the remainders of the Daoguard Tower, taking out all
usable Sithe artifacts and even a few unusable ones.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoguard
Towers were exclusively employed by extremely powerful Sithe, who
placed many of their treasures inside the towers. Some of the weapons
could even come together in incredibly powerful combinations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the previous battle, Ning hadn’t even entered the Daoguard tower.
As a result, many of the powerful internal defenses hadn’t even
been used! None of the external weapons were capable of killing Ning
from a distance of a billion kilometers. At this distance, Ning was
able to dodge with ease even the quickest of attacks. Otherverse
Lords might not be able to dodge, but Ning was a different story.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
bad.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
one is decent.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this hammer is scary powerful.” Ning and the other two continued to
loot the tower, with Azurefiend and the Paragon of Pills occasionally
testing out the items they found.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills was fairly blasé, as she had adventured through the
Sithelands many times and already owned multiple Sithe weapons.
Azurefiend, however, didn’t own any Sithe weapons at all. Even the
suppressive black chains were merely on loan from Ning, who had yet
to actually ‘gift’ them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending a full hour combing through the ruins, the team completely
looted the area clean. They even took many fragments which were
completely unusable. They found a total of twenty-one usable Sithe
weapons, and they all had different effects. Some were actually used
to scry and scan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
is a lot of fine weapons,” Azurefiend said excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
found so much treasure from this one site.” The Paragon of Pills
was delighted as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, was rather disappointed. “Is this it? This is much less
than what I expected. We didn’t find a single major artifact at
all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace’s ‘Blacksun’, the castle that was used to defend the
Three Realms, the city of Houwu in the Blazesun Domain, the Blazesun
Ruler’s giant warship… all these counted as ‘major artifacts’.
In contrast, the treasures which Ning had acquired after combing
through the tower were all quite mediocre. There wasn’t even a
single major artifact. All of the treasures combined were probably
just barely on par with the Blacksun in value.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is already a good haul,” the Paragon of Pills said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
According to the Autarchs’ records, even the most ordinary of
Daoguard Towers would have more than this,” Ning said. “I
suspected early on that the original owner of the Daoguard Tower had
slipped away long ago. Now, I’m sure of it. The original owner must
have taken the most valuable treasures out of the Daoguard Tower,
leaving behind just the ones he was unable to physically remove from
the tower itself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills cast a puzzled glance at the armor and items left
behind by the deceased short creature. “Isn’t that dead Sithe the
owner?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Probably
not,” Ning said. “A mere roar from the nagapede was enough to
transform him into dust. He probably wasn’t at the Hegemon level of
power! Mistress, you might not know this, but amongst the Sithe only
Hegemons can build Daoguard Towers. And, to be more precise, only an
incredibly small fraction of Hegemons are qualified to do this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Sithe Chaosverse, weak Eternal Emperors were all permitted to
build their own Daoguard towers… but here, they were invaders! They
had invaded Ning’s Chaosverse, and their resources were extremely
limited. Building Daoguard Towers was extremely difficult, and
erecting a weak one was pointless. Thus, only the most supreme of
Sithe Hegemons as well as the Sithe Exalts were permitted to build
Daoguard Towers, which they used as focal points for massacring
unsuspecting cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
go and bind the estate-world that Sithe left behind. Let’s see if
there are any interesting treasures inside of it,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right
on.” Azurefiend excitedly flew over and began to bind the
estate-world. Right now, he was on his absolute best behavior in
front of Ning. This was partially due to Ning’s overwhelming power,
partially to convince Ning to give him more pointers, and partially
because he hoped that he might be lucky enough to receive a Sithe
treasure reward from Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whoah.”
Azurefiend’s wizened old face suddenly twisted in shock, his eyes
bulging out. “That is a LOT.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wipe
that freaky look off your face. What treasures does it hold?” Ning
laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
all the treasures were hidden here! Master, take a look at all these
treasures!” Azurefiend waved his hand, causing a series of
treasures to appear and levitate in the air before them. Light shone
from the Paragon of Pills’ eyes, and even the formerly-calm Ning
revealed a look of shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Twenty…
twenty-one… twenty-two… a total of twenty-nine treasures appeared
before them. There were even TWO realmships in this cache!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
all the good treasures were here.” The Paragon of Pills let out an
amazed sigh, then turned to stare with shock at a gray spear that was
covered with a fiery red floral pattern. “Isn’t that the
Exterminatus Spear of the Almighty Seeker of Defeat?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Exterminatus Spear?” Azurefiend was shocked as well. He stared
intently at the spear, then said, “Paragon, are you sure? Is it
possible that this is another, similar weapon?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way I’m wrong about this. When the Almighty Seeker of Defeat
first acquired this spear, it didn’t have that red floral pattern
on it. The Seeker added it later on. Supposedly, he put that fiery
red floral pattern on every single weapon he used. The floral pattern
probably had some sort of special meaning for him.” The Paragon of
Pills shook her head. “He died long ago, and I heard he died in the
Sithelands. I never would’ve thought that he actually died here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “That explains it all. Most of these treasures were
probably left behind by the cultivators who invaded this place over
the course of many aeons. That short Sithe collected all of their
treasures after killing them. I was wondering why there were TWO
realmships in that estate-world. It seems that they came from slain
cultivators.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills let out a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mistress,
take whatever you need,” Ning said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be honest, these are of no use to me.” The Paragon of Pills looked
at Ning. “Darknorth, I think you know what I want above all else.
As for these treasures? Even if I took all of them, they probably
still wouldn’t be enough to convince an Autarch to help me out.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_010__The"></A>
Chapter 10: Space Sword Dao</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have a request to make. I know it is a bit excessive, but I truly am
out of options.” The Paragon of Pills looked at Ji Ning. “I have
no choice but to shamelessly ask you to help me out, Darknorth.
Please ask an Autarch to revive those three brothers of mine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills rarely begged others. She was, by nature, an
extremely proud person. However, reviving her three brothers was
virtually her entire reason for existence, something which she wanted
above everything else. It was much like how Ning desperately wished
to be able to revive his wife Yu Wei!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills had repeatedly risked her life in diving into the
Sithe ruins, but she still wasn’t even close to having as much
treasure as the Autarch had demanded for his aid. The Autarch had
asked for a thousand realmships worth of treasure! This was an
incredible request, so high as to cause her to feel despair. This was
why she had become even more crazed in her pursuit of treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
she was able to sense hope when she looked at Ning. She viewed Ning
as she would a son, and in her heart she truly didn’t want to ask
this of him. However, she really was out of options. Thus, she had
‘shamelessly’ begged him for help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mistress.”
Ning knew how the Paragon of Pills felt. He smiled. “Mistress,
don’t worry. I’ll definitely go ask the Autarchs to help out. I
can’t speak on their behalf, but I can say that there is a 90%
chance they’ll agree.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“90%
chance?” The Paragon’s heart swelled with indescribable
excitement. Even her face turned ruddy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
had been waiting for far, far too long. For the sake of this goal,
she had nearly driven herself insane. In pursuit of this goal, she
had accomplished many things which were viewed as miracles. When she
had first gained eternity, she was an ordinary Eternal Emperor, not a
Hegemon… but she had managed to slowly train to the Hegemon level,
then reach incredibly high levels of skill in many different Daos.
All of this was for the sake of reviving her three brothers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled upon seeing this. The reason why he had said there was a 90%
chance was merely because he hadn’t actually asked any of the
Autarchs yet. In truth, Ning knew that the Autarchs were desperately
looking for ways to help him out in order to express their gratitude.
Bring something back to life? This was a fairly minor ask. So long as
it was possible, the Autarchs would definitely agree!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
we leave the Sithelands, I’ll immediately ask the Autarchs to help
out,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
The Paragon of Pills’ entire aura seemed to have transformed. In
the past, she was incomparably cold and remote… but now, a hint of
lively fire seemed to course through her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
Now, Mistress, can you go ahead and choose the treasures you want?”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
already have multiple Sithe weapons. A few more won’t make much of
a difference,” the Paragon refused. She felt that she had already
taken too much advantage of Ning. She couldn’t accept any further
gifts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seeing
this, Ning nodded. “Ah, but you don’t have a realmship yet,
right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon blinked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmships
make life much more convenient. Take this one.” Ning waved his
hand, sending a realmship to float in front of the Paragon of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills no longer held back. She immediately said, “Fine,
I’ll accept this.” She truly did feel as though destiny was a
marvelous thing. When she had led Ning to the Trileaf Realm, he was
just a child… and now, this child had completely changed her
destiny.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
suit of armor can be used to cover your entire body. It is highly
defensive, but it’ll also increase your attack power dramatically.
It’s quite multifunctional. With this by your side, you should be
able to survive even an enraged Otherverse Lord.” Ning waved his
hand, choosing a heavy suit of coppery red armor and sending it over
to Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was rather stunned. He truly did badly desire a Sithe treasure, but
he himself felt that he had done too little for Ning to warrant one
yet. He felt a bit embarrassed to be given one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I’ll accept it.” Azurefiend had a solemn look on his face. “I’ve
been alive for so many years, but I never had a Sithe weapon to call
my own. I, Azurefiend, shall never forget your benevolence, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
his heart, Azurefiend silently decided that although his master would
one day perish, he would continue to safeguard his master’s family
and friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is just a toy to me. No need to get too emotional.” Ning waved his
hand, collecting all of the other treasures. He didn’t really care
about them, because his original plan had been to wait until the
later stages of his truesoul’s disintegration before doing a bit of
adventuring in the Sithelands. Since he was already here, he was
going to continue wandering through the Sithelands after asking the
Autarchs to revive the Paragon of Pills’ three brothers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words, he would have plenty more treasures coming his way!
Hegemons might have to risk their lives to acquire Sithe treasures,
but Ning was able to acquire them with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
fully looting the Daoguard Tower, Ning turned to stare at the many
dimensional hallways barring their path. “These dimensional
hallways have been completely sealed off. For now, there’s no way
out. If I used all my power, it would take me ten or twenty
sword-strikes to carve a path open for us, but it really isn’t
worth it. Now that the Daoguard Tower has been destroyed, they no
longer have a power source and will quickly use up the little energy
they have.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
his awesome Sword Dao Domain descended and began to furiously smash
against the distant dimensional hallways. The criss-crossing hallways
were able to endure the assault, but flickers of light began to
appear on their surfaces. Clearly, they were using up a great deal of
power to resist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
how long will it take?” Azurefiend asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
should I know?” Ning laughed. “Less than a chaos cycle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was able to keep his Sword Dao Domain continuously activated. It drew
from the power of the Chaosverse itself; not one iota of Ning’s own
energies were consumed. It would last for as long as he wanted it to
last! While doing so, Ning began a period of silent meditation and
cultivation, as did the Paragon of Pills and Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one year after another. The dimensional hallways continued
to hold firm; clearly, they had been infused with quite a bit of
power. Over eight million years went by in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a ripple suddenly spread out with Ning at its center. The Paragon of
Pills and Azurefiend were seated in the lotus position atop boulders
within the tower ruins, and they both opened their eyes as the ripple
washed past them. They both felt a thrill of fear go down their
spine, and both sighed at how incredible Darknorth was! One was
Ning’s retainer, while the other was essentially one of Ning’s
teachers, but both marveled at how unfathomably powerful he had
become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
their level, they couldn’t even truly understand how terrifying
Ning’s Sword Dao was. Just the tiniest bit of leakage from its aura
was enough to cause them to feel fear. When that invisible ripple
washed past them, they felt as though invisible blades were slicing
at their bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Space Sword Dao.” Ning opened his eyes, then reached out with his
hand. Whoosh! An ethereal sword appeared above the palm of his hand,
emanating ripples of dimensional power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Prior
to coming here, Ning had spent three thousand chaos cycles wandering
the Chaosverse with his daughter and had nearly finished infusing his
Dao of Space into his Eternal Omega Sword Dao. After seeing the
dimensional hallways, he gained new insights into the Dao of Space.
This sped up the infusion process, allowing him to break through and
master his Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Space Sword Dao was highly suited for dimensional travel, allowing
him to tear through space like it was nothing more than tofu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
this day forth, the amount of distance he could travel when he used
his sword to tear through space would skyrocket. The Autarch of
Annihilation, ‘Autarch Ekong’, was not particularly skilled in
the Dao of Space, and so he wouldn’t be able to travel as far or as
fast as Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had reached the Hegemonic level in the Dao of Space long ago, after
all. Now, he had infused it all into his Sword Dao and formed the
Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mastering
the Space Sword Dao clearly took much more time than the Lightning
Sword Dao or the Five Elements Sword Dao.” Ning shook his head to
himself. “But the further down this road I go, the more time will
be needed. I just don’t have enough time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
each improvement, Ning could sense that his foundation was broadening
and that he was getting slightly closer to success. Ning felt certain
that if he had enough time, he had a very good chance of reaching the
ultimate pinnacle via this route.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
half-million years went by after Ning mastered the Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally…
Crack! Crack! Crack! The dimensional hallways that had been for many
years just barely able to endure Ning’s sword-light finally began
to twist, shudder, and crack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Looks
of delight appeared on the faces of Ning, Azurefiend, and the Paragon
of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we’ve finally broken through!” Azurefiend grinned. “I thought
that we’d actually spend an entire chaos cycle here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
impressed it managed to last as long as it did. I kept my Sword Dao
Domain active this entire time, assaulting them without pause, but
they still managed to last for many years. Honestly, if I used the
brute-force method, I don’t think twenty blows of the sword
would’ve been enough. I probably would’ve had to kill myself,”
Ning said with a laugh. As he spoke, some of the dimensional hallways
began to completely break apart and collapse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
dimensional hallways began to break apart and crumble. The
Dimensional Hallway Lock was an extremely complicated technique which
not even Ning could solve, despite his mastery of the Space Sword
Dao… but now that its energies had been exhausted, it was still
going to crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
all of the dimensional hallways vanished without a trace, leaving
behind just a few pocket dimensions which hovered in the skies like
lonely little islands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thanks
to the karmic lines tying them together, Ning knew exactly which
pocket dimension Lord Annihilation was in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
see what the other dimensions hold,” Ning said with a laugh. With
but a thought, he sent out countless streams of sword-light to
surround and assault the hundreds of pocket dimensions, piercing
through them to reveal what lay within.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_011__The"></A>
Chapter 11: Tamed</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning, the Paragon of Pills, and Azurefiend all stared at the pocket
dimensions as the streaks of sword-light pierced through them. They
instantly saw that two of them held the two companions of the
Paragon. One held Lord Annihilation, whose eyes were filled with
murderous bloodlust. The other was filled with a gray-robed woman who
had silvery hair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Annihilation raised his head to stare at the outside world, a
murderous look in his eyes. The gray-robed woman turned to stare at
Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Annihilation!”
the Paragon of Pills barked coldly. “Wake up!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Annihilation’s gaze slowly returned to his normal calm. Swoosh!
Swoosh! Both he and the gray-robed woman immediately flew out of
their pocket dimensions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Paragon of Pills. Thank you, Daolord Darknorth.” Lord
Annihilation had a delighted look on his face and behaved with
tremendous respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
was going on just now?” Ning was rather surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Annihilation
was being constantly assaulted by illusions. Every so often, he’d
be drawn into a berserk state,” the Paragon said. “However, each
time he would eventually regain his clarity of mind after giving vent
to his rage.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Annihilation said in a rather embarrassed manner, “But the amount
of time I was able to remain clear-minded was slowly shrinking. If I
was trapped for a few hundred more chaos cycles, I probably would’ve
completely lost myself to the madness. I only escaped that fate
because you saved me, Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to keep his Sword Dao Domain active, using it to scan
through the secrets of that dimensional pocket. He couldn’t help
but secretly sigh in amazement at what he found. The illusions had
been set up in a truly intricate and marvelous way which would allow
them to silently and soundlessly penetrate a prisoner’s defenses,
then affect his mind. However, Ning suspected that many of the
formations in this Daoguard Tower had not been personally set down by
the master of the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe had major powers who specialized in formations or artificing.
They would mass produce these things, then auction them off. The
‘Dimensional Hallway Lock’, for example, was something which only
a Sithe Exalt could create.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tia
greets you, Daolord Darknorth.” The silvery-haired gray-robed woman
flew over and bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that this woman was viewed by many as being just as ‘crazy’
as the Paragon of Pills. She often went adventuring in the
Sithelands. However, she was different from the Paragon, who was more
distant and cold. Hegemon Tia was calm and tranquil, as though
nothing could cause a stir in her soul. She was someone who would
react calmly to anything and everything. Even if she herself was
about to die, she would respond with this calm equanimity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
look over there.” Azurefiend pointed towards a distant pocket
dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
the Paragon, Tia, and Lord Annihilation all turned to look. This was
a dimension filled with black mist. Inside, there was a towering
mountain that had a beautiful palace located at the very peak. There
were even a few servants in front of the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems rather lavish. I imagine that’s where the Sithe normally
resided,” Ning said. “Come, let’s go take a look.” Ning’s
group quickly flew through the air towards that floating pocket
dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
palace was quite beautiful. Some servants were busy keeping it clean,
while others were standing watch. As soon as Ning’s group landed,
they all bowed respectfully and called out: “Masters.” All of
them, however, seemed rather puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are all Daolords.” The Paragon of Pills was rather startled. She
asked, “You’ve never met any of us. Why do you call us
‘Masters’?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
servants exchanged glances, rather nervous. The Paragon of Pills
frowned. “You were able to become Daolords. How is it that you are
this spineless?” She pointed at the old Daolord who seemed to be
the most powerful. “You. Answer my question.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
old man said respectfully, “Everyone who comes here is a ‘Master’.
We are eternal servants.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared intently at them, scrying the pasts of these servants. These
Daolords all felt rather terrified when they saw Ning staring at them
like this. They felt as though this white-robed Daolord was able to
completely see through them. This sensation caused their hearts to
quiver.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
all used to live within the estate-world.” Ning sighed.
“Afterwards, they were chosen by the Sithe to come here and serve.
All of them have been trained to be incredibly obedient.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
when were Daolords so easily tamed?” Azurefiend was rather
surprised. Most Samsara Daolords would rather die than submit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
just Daolords. Even Hegemons have been tamed.” Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. When he scried the pasts of these Daolords, he was also
able to see some other information regarding this palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you, come out!” Ning barked, sending out his Sword Dao Domain to
press down upon every inch of the palace. The formerly-quiet palace
suddenly changed, with five figures flying out of it like streaks of
light. All of them had awesome auras of power. They were all either
Hegemons or Otherverse Lords, and their eyes were completely dead and
devoid of all emotion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is Master’s estate. How dare you trespass here?” The five figures
were filled with malevolence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you… Lord Starbearer?” The Paragon of Pills was able to recognize
one of the Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Skypillar?” Hegemon Azurefiend called out in shock, “Y-you… do
you recognize me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend?”
A red-haired man replied coldly, “Of course I recognize you.
However, this is my master’s territory. Now that you have come
here, you must die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
All five figures quickly charged forwards, seeking to slay Ning and
the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Freeze!”
Ning commanded softly. Instantly, four of the five charging figures
were completely paralyzed by the suppressive might of Ning’s Sword
Dao Domain. Only the Otherverse Lord who the Paragon had called ‘Lord
Starbearer’ was able to continue his charge towards Ning, thanks to
his entire body being covered by the power of his otherverse.
However, Ning was able to send out incredibly powerful blows of
sword-light to keep him at bay with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
chain him down,” Ning commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master!” Azurefiend had been patiently waiting for a good
opportunity. When he saw Ning knock down Lord Starbearer with a
streak of sword-light, Azurefiend immediately attacked with all six
black chains. He quickly bound Lord Starbearer in layers of chains,
ensuring that he was no longer able to move at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Skypillar, what’s wrong with you? We journeyed together and
adventured together. Have you forgotten?” Hegemon Azurefiend
couldn’t believe that this good friend of his would attack him. He
had wandered through many places, and Hegemon Skypillar was someone
he counted amongst his life-and-death friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
who offend Master must die!” the bound Hegemon Skypillar said
through clenched teeth, a frenzied look on his face. As for the
others… their eyes remained completely dead, but they also had
berserk looks on their faces. They truly wanted to kill Ning and his
team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly understood what was going on. He let out a sigh. “Although
they kept their memories, they’ve already lost their sense of self.
They’ve been tamed and transformed into a type of special Sithe
golem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Golem?”
The Paragon of Pills and the others didn’t understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Their
bodies were unchanged and they kept all their powers and memories…
but they’ve completely lost their id, their ego, their sense of
self. They are like golems in that they will simply do whatever their
master commands. They will obey any order their master gives them,”
Ning explained. “They might be ‘alive’, but in reality they are
like golems. Those two stone pythons who attacked me earlier were
also living creatures who were transformed into golems.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Most
golems were created via magic treasures. The Sithe, however… they
were able to convert living beings into golems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
all intents and purposes, they died long ago.” Ning looked at the
five powerful cultivators, sighing at the savage, murderous look on
their faces. “Let us grant them rest at long last.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash.
Slash. Slash. Slash. Slash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
five were ground to dust by Ning’s sword-light. Even Lord
Starbearer was slain, due to the black chains suppressing his power
and preventing him from fighting back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
look of heart-ache and grief was on Azurefiend’s old face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemons
and Otherverse Lords can be transformed into golems?” The Paragon
of Pills shook her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is extremely difficult to convert powerful creatures into golems, and
the stronger their Dao-heart is the better. For these five to have
been converted is a sign that their Dao-hearts simply weren’t
strong enough. In addition, the conversion process requires an
extremely long period of time. The process has to be slow and
gradual, without the cultivators even noticing anything. If the
cultivators knew that their terrifying fate was to be transformed
into golems, they would probably commit suicide instead. That’s why
the process has to be gradual; not the slightest bit of haste is
acceptable! By the time the cultivator realizes what has happened, it
is already too late,” Ning said. This was part of the information
which the Autarchs had provided to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Annihilation was greatly shocked by this. “Then when I was being
repeatedly assaulted by those illusions… was that part of the
taming and transforming process?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Most
likely, yes.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
could sense some charming spells aimed at me in my pocket dimension
as well,” the Paragon of Pills said. “But I just stayed there
without daring to move anywhere. It didn’t seem to affect me much.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
how strong your Dao-heart is, Mistress, there is no way the Sithe
would’ve been able to convert you.” Ning glanced at the palace.
“I can sense that this palace holds quite a few prisoners inside.
Almost all of them are Daolords who refused to obey orders, which is
why they were imprisoned and tortured by that short Sithe. I can also
sense that a Hegemon has been imprisoned there as well. Most likely,
the taming process failed with him.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_012__The"></A>
Chapter 12: Grand Dimensional Formation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning waved a finger from afar. Rumble… Ning’s Sword Dao Domain
actually forcibly excavated the entire prison beneath the palace,
causing it fly outwards before settling upon the ground with a boom.
The prison cages all shattered apart, revealing the imprisoned
Daolords who were inside, all of whom looked to be in terrible shape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
largest cell had been used to imprison a black-haired man who had a
single horn on his head. His hair was tousled, and his entire body
was covered with a spiderweb of countless scars.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-haired man raised his head and stared towards Ning. His gaze
was cold and resolute, as though nothing could shake his will at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
A puzzled look appeared in his eyes. “The Paragon of Pills? Hegemon
Tia?” the black-haired man said in a low, hoarse voice. He
recognized these two ‘madwomen’ who often visited the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Flameleft?” Hegemon Tia was startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flameleft,
you are still alive?!” The Paragon of Pills was shocked as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced at the mechanisms and barriers used to chain the black-haired
man. He immediately sent out streaks of sword-light that quickly
shattered them to bits. With those barriers gone, Hegemon Flameleft
regained his power and the wounds on his body quickly vanished. Black
robes appeared over his body, and he turned to stare at Ning in a
rather puzzled manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
could sense that this white-robed Daolord in front of him was
incredibly terrifying; the sword-light the Daolord had created was
capable of slaying him with ease. And yet, the man was clearly just a
Daolord who had failed the Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Flameleft, this is Daolord Darknorth,” Lord Annihilation said
hurriedly. “We all owe our very lives to Daolord Darknorth. He is
so strong that he treats with Autarchs as equals; not even the Sithe
Exalts can compare to him in power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Flameleft instantly realized just how incredibly powerful Daolord
Darknorth was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flameleft
thanks you, Daolord, for saving my life.” Hegemon Flameleft
hurriedly bowed respectfully, a grateful look in his eyes. “Flameleft
shall never forget the grace you have shown me today.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
one would ever know how much torment and misery he had suffered. On
multiple occasions, he had very nearly broken down. All the others
who had been captured had committed suicide early on. Those who
didn’t commit suicide in time would see their divine power and
Immortal energy sealed away, making future suicide impossible! They
were imprisoned and suffered countless torments that were truly
indescribable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suicide
was no longer an option, and they had only two options before them.
The first was to submit and become a puppet. The second was to
continue resisting. In the end, the only one who managed to continue
resisting was Flameleft.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs who had seen this in the past actually drew from it, using
it as an inspiration for their idea of torturing Sithe Exalts in the
hopes that they would finally give up and allow their truesouls and
souls to be infiltrated. That way, once the Sithe Exalts died, their
truesoul fragments would be absorbed and swallowed by Ning’s
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts had nearly been driven mad from the torture, but they
clearly were still capable of enduring it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flameleft,
were any of your weapons stolen by the Sithe? I already killed the
Sithe who ran this place and have all of his treasures,” Ning said.
He felt a great deal of admiration for Hegemon Flameleft; the man had
been able to endure for so very long, even though there was no
visible hope whatsoever! This was no easy feat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t have many powerful weapons,” Hegemon Flameleft said. “The
only good weapon I had was that axe I always used.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately waved his hand, causing a series of axes to appear before
him. There were six in total, and one of them voluntarily flew over
to Hegemon Flameleft. Hegemon Flameleft excitedly grasped the axe.
The axe itself was shivering!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
wasn’t easy for you to stay alive,” Ning said with a laugh. “Stay
safe and avoid the Sithelands unless you have a compelling reason to
be here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Hegemon Flameleft was the type of person who always repaid his debts
to others. Ning had saved his life, and so he privately swore that he
would definitely do everything he could to repay Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
bracelet is an interesting Sithe trinket. It won’t make you much
stronger, but it’ll be useful to you whenever you need to flee.”
Ning waved his hand, tossing out a Sithe bracelet. “Don’t be shy
and just take it. I feel quite a bit of admiration for you, to tell
you the truth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Flameleft hesitated slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Flameleft, just accept it,” Hegemon Tia said, as did the Paragon of
Pills. Both of them knew that Daolord Darknorth had completely
surpassed all other cultivators and was virtually a peer of the
Autarchs. Most Sithe artifacts were truly useless to him, while the
Three Realms only needed some of the more important ones.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Besides…
if Ning really did need Sithe weapons, he could go to any of the
ruins and acquire a mountain of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Daolord.” Flameleft wasn’t the wishy-washy type, and so he
offered a simple thanks while firmly engraving Ning’s kindness into
his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
time for us to leave.” Ning glanced at the surrounding area.
Daoguard Towers were absolute nightmares for other cultivators, but
they wouldn’t be that bad for him if it wasn’t for the fact that
his truesoul was constantly crumbling. He had been forced to attack
several times here, resulting in his lifespan lessening by quite a
bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning and the others immediately soared into the skies, flying into
the endless black mist outside the lonely dimensional islands. After
flying for a short period of time, they flew out of it and reached
the empty void outside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ding!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
extremely pleasing sound suddenly spread out from very far away in
spacetime. Ning’s face hardened slightly as he swept the area with
his gaze. Ever since he had mastered the Space Sword Dao, his
attunement towards space had become extremely acute. He saw that far
off in the distant, there was a total of nine ‘corners’ which
held enormous hidden regions within them. Now, all nine corners had
suddenly begun to emanate dazzling light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong, Darknorth?” The Paragon of Pills, Azurefiend, and the others
were all puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
get out of here right away!” Just as the words were leaving Ning’s
lips, space began to twist around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The nine distant ‘specks’ of light resonated together to generate
a grand dimensional formation that instantly swept across the region
Ning was in, forming a black hole that sucked all of them inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
heartbeat leater, everything grew calm again. Aside from the fact
that Ning’s group had just vanished, everything seemed completely
ordinary and unpertubed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
group reappeared within a blurry region filled by clouds and mist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
are we?” the Paragon of Pills said as they all scanned the region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
godsense has been suppressed. I’m unable to see anything at all,”
Lord Annihilation said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
scanned the area silently. His face was even more solemn than it had
been during their battles at the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a terrifying formation, and what a terrifying level of mastery over
the Dao of Space!” Ning murmured softly. Just now, he had been able
to witness with great clarity how they had been forcibly teleported
into this place. Those nine incomparably distant and vast dimensions
had joined together into an enormous formation of dazzling
profundity. This was a level of mastery over space which left Ning
breathless. Nobody in their entire Chaosverse was capable of such a
thing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
where are we?” the Paragon of Pills asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Still
in Sithe territory,” Ning said heavily. “But this place is
probably a hundred times deadlier than the Daoguard Tower we were
in.” Although they had arrived just a short while ago, the hints
which Ning saw allowed him to quickly understand how dangerous a
situation they were in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos. Autarch Ekong…” Ning immediately began to reach out
through the message-talismans to all six Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong, Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs scattered throughout the Chaosverse all immediately
responded to Ning, including Autarch Mogg who was responsible for
standing watch over the Sithelands. This was the very first time Ning
had ever used the message-talisman to contact them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is something I need some assistance with,” Ning sent through the
talisman. “I am in the Sithelands and broke through a Daoguard
Tower to save some cultivators, but just as I was about to leave I
was forcibly teleported elsewhere by a formation of incredible power.
This formation was established by linking together nine enormous
dimensions and was incredibly complex; I believe it has surpassed the
limits of what cultivators in our Chaosverse can accomplish. My
companions and I are now trapped here, and we are afraid to
recklessly move around.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
stay right where you are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stay
there and don’t move.” The Autarchs quickly began to send their
replies. In dangerous places, the more you moved around the quicker
you would die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I’m not going anywhere. I could sense danger as soon as I
arrived. If I tried to escape on my own, I’d probably end up dying
here. I don’t really care about my own life, as my truesoul is
already breaking down, but someone extremely important to me is here
as well as a few other cultivators,” Ning sent. He truly didn’t
wish for the Paragon of Pills to die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
avatars are all standing watch over the Sithelands,” Autarch
Titanos said. “I’ll have my avatar meet up with Mogg’s and
we’ll work together on this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
had incredibly powerful avatars, as they were generally outfitted
with many mighty weapons. Most Autarch avatars had nearly 80% of the
true body’s power!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_013__The"></A>
Chapter 13: The Hidden Dimension</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Sithe heartlands had been completely sealed off, they continued
to represent a disaster waiting to happen to the cultivator
civilizations! Thus, Autarch Mogg eternally stood watch over this
place, as did his avatar and the avatars of all five other Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
Space twisted, resulting in a dazzling tunnel of light appearing. Two
figures emerged shoulder-to-shoulder from this tunnel of light, with
one being the bald red-robed avatar of Autarch Titanos, and the other
being a Tall, skinny, azure-robed man who had some scales on his
cheeks. The second man was Autarch Mogg, and his eyes were flecked
with azure light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two stepped out of the tunnel of light and entered normal space.
“Darknorth, we’ve already arrived. Let Mogg and I investigate
this place first.” Autarch Titanos glanced at the distant region,
filled with a billowing black fog which surrounded many pocket
dimensions that floated in the air. This was the place where the
Paragon of Pills had been trapped previously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ji Ning waited from the separate dimension he had been teleported to.
Now that the two Autarchs had arrived, he felt a sense of hope.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason these two had arrived was because of the specific Daos they
followed. Autarch Mogg walked the path of the Space Daobirth Essence
and was the Autarch with the greatest amount of control over space.
This was why he was responsible for standing guard over the
Sithelands; if anything happened, he would be able to sense it thanks
to his dimensional mastery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Autarch Titanos, his path was that of the Karma Daobirth Essence,
an even more incredible Dao! He had met Ning twice, and as a result
the two were connected by karma. It was possible that he would be
able to sense Ning’s location thanks to the karma which bound them
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
avatars of Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos scanned the area
vigilantly. “Mogg, what do you think?” Autarch Titanos asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait
a moment,” Autarch Mogg said, his azure eyes scanning the void
around them. Although the grand dimensional formation was now
dormant, there were still some traces of its previous activation
which allowed Autarch Mogg to calculate some of the secrets behind
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Space
trembled and rippled before his gaze. Suddenly, he stared off into
the distance, then turned to look at several other locations as well.
Frowning, he said, “Darknorth was right. This formation was
activated from nine separate locations, each of which is incredibly
far away. This formation is marvelously intricate, and its usage of
dimensional mastery far surpasses my own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
cannot find the dimension Darknorth and his team have been teleported
to.” Autarch Mogg shook his head. “What about you, Titanos?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth’s
too far away. I can’t find him via just karma alone.” Autarch
Titanos frowned as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clouds
lazily drifted nearby. Ning’s group remained atop the clouds, not
daring to move about rashly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
we’re unable to find the exact place you have been trapped,”
Autarch Titanos replied. “Our only option is to have your
Primaltwin come over here as well. Your Primaltwin should be able to
sense your true body, allowing it to find you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mogg
will head straight to the Flamedragon Realmverse and bring your
Primaltwin over here,” Autarch Titanos stated. “The place you
have been imprisoned in is most likely an extremely important Sithe
nexus point. Given that we didn’t even know it existed, it has to
be an incredibly dangerous place to be in. Don’t move about rashly;
just stay there and wait for us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, I’m not so rash as to run around wildly,” Ning sent back.
The two sides then broke off the connection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was starting to feel rather grim. Autarch Titanos was skilled in
karma, while Autarch Mogg was skilled in space, yet neither was able
to locate him. This meant the formation which teleported him here was
truly incredible!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
did it go, Darknorth?” The Paragon of Pills looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, everything will be fine. We’ll wait right here. The Autarchs
are already on their way, but the place we’re in is fairly stable.
It’ll probably take them a bit of time,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Tia, Hegemon Flameleft, and the others were all secretly astonished.
Daolord Darknorth truly was incredible; as soon as he was trapped
here, Autarchs hastened over to help him out. The words ‘the
Autarchs are already on their way’ clearly indicated that more than
one Autarch had come. Since when were Autarchs so amenable to helping
out ordinary cultivators?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
did the Sithe establish this secret location?” Ning glanced at the
surrounding area. Thanks to his incredible insight, he was able to
vaguely see a vast sea off in the distance. He was quite curious as
to what this realm contained, but he knew that if he indulged it too
much it would be the death of him. He couldn’t be rash; it was best
to wait for the Autarchs to come.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took Autarch Mogg a mere month to find Ning’s black-robed
Primaltwin, then bring it all the way over to the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Primaltwin Ning was currently standing next to Autarch
Mogg and Autarch Titanos in the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body and the other cultivators were teleported away from that
location right there.” The black-robed Ning pointed to an area of
space, then pointed towards nine different directions. “The nine
different sources of that dimensional formation came from those nine
directions. All of them were located extremely far away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
exactly what I sensed as well.” Autarch Mogg nodded. He had been in
a rather contemplative state ever since he had discovered the
dimensional formation. Clearly, he had been pondering over this
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
where is your true body?” Autarch Titanos asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can sense its location.” Ning noded. “I’d like to ask you to
help me lead the way, Autarch Mogg.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg led the way in carving through space, while Ning’s Primaltwin
guided him in his path. After spending the time needed to boil a
kettle of tea, they had traversed the equivalent of five or six
realmverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had reached a region of empty darkness which held nothing at all. The
black-robed Ning stood there in the void, slowly moving forwards and
warping through ten billion kilometers of space with each step he
took.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Forward.
Back. Up. Down. Ning seemed to be walking in circles, while the
avatars of Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos watched from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that’s odd.” The black-robed Ning scanned the area. “Autarch
Mogg, Autarch Titanos, I can clearly sense that my true body is
within a hundred billion kilometers of us! And yet, I’ve discovered
that no matter where I go, I cannot move any closer to it. Just now,
I even tried to enter other dimensional continuums but still remained
unable to move closer to my true body.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
hundred billion kilometers?” Autarch Titanos glanced at Autarch
Mogg. “Mogg, what do you think?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
hundred billion kilometers was a very short amount of distance to
figures like Autarchs and Ning; a single step through spacetime was
more than enough to traverse such a distance. And yet, Ning’s
Primaltwin was able to sense his true body’s location but was
completely unable to move any closer to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is an enormous hidden dimension here.” Autarch Mogg scanned the
area, his eyes shooting out rays of blurry azure light which caused
space to twist and distort. He said calmly, “This gigantic
dimension is extremely well-made and perfectly separated from the
outside world. No matter what you try, you won’t be able to move a
single step closer to this dimension.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was similar to mortals walking on Ning’s old world of ‘Earth’.
No matter how much time they spent walking on Earth’s surface, they
would never be able to move any closer to Earth’s core. By the same
principle, Ning was completely unable to move closer to this hidden
region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is absolutely perfect. Although I can vaguely sense that it is here,
I can’t find any flaws in its creation at all which would allow me
to lock onto it,” Autarch Mogg said. “If the teleportation
formation was to activate again and bring another outsider here, I
would be able to detect its location during the teleportation process
and then open a dimensional tunnel to it. Right now, though, it is
completely hidden and sealed away from us. There’s nothing I can
do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to somehow activate it a second time?” The black-robed Ning
felt a bit frustrated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
dimensional tunnel has completely blocked off karma itself. I can’t
locate Darknorth’s true body through karma either.” Autarch
Titanos looked at Ning. “Darknorth, I’m ashamed to say this, but
neither of us will be able to solve this problem in a short amount of
time. I’ll have Ekong and the others come test it out as well.
Perhaps one of them will succeed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’ll
be fine even if you cannot. I might be trapped inside, but not just
anyone can bring harm to me,” the black-robed Ning said. “I’ll
figure something out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful.” Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg felt rather guilty. They
knew that if even the two of them were helpless, it was unlikely the
other four would succeed; Autarch Skyfeeder was skilled in the Dao of
Time, Autarch Ekong was skilled in the Dao of Destruction, Autarch
Bolin was skilled in the Dao of the Claw, and Autarch Stonerule was
skilled in the Dao of Illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
reason my true body entered the Sithelands was to save someone; the
Paragon of Pills,” Ning said. “The Mistress wishes to revive her
three brothers, one of whom is a Hegemon of the Dao of the Sword.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
the Paragon of Pills? I know of her.” Autarch Titanos nodded. “She
sought me out, and I told her to come back after she had a thousand
realmships worth of treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “Autarch Titanos, I’d like to ask you to help the Mistress
complete this dream of hers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter,” Autarch Titanos said. “But the otherverse she
resides in was created by Autarch Skyfeeder. I’ll have her handle
this personally. It’ll be much easier for her to keep that
otherverse safe while reversing spacetime to revive those three.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
task was indescribably difficult for Hegemons, but to Autarchs it was
nothing more than a bit of extra effort.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you have to be careful inside there,” Autarch Mogg said solemnly.
“We originally thought that we had taken full control over the
Sithelands’s perimeter, sealing away the few places we didn’t
breach… but clearly, we were wrong. There are hidden areas we were
not aware of! I imagine that the Sithe have been watching us in
secret, biding their time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. Even if a Sithe Exalt comes, I’ll kill him with a blow from
my sword,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
that blurry, cloud-filled region. The white-robed Ning said to the
Paragon of Pills, “Mistress, I’ve already spoken to the Autarchs.
Autarch Skyfeeder will personally revive your three brothers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Tears
appeared in the Paragon’s eyes, and her entire body began to
tremble. Finally, two tears fell down… but a smile was on her face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
solitary, glacially cold woman was actually, finally smiling. Her
smile was radiant and beautiful, and even Ning was rather stunned by
it. This was beauty that stemmed from the depths of a soul, beauty
and joy which was truly infectious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Darknorth.” The Paragon of Pills looked at Ning.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_014__The"></A>
Chapter 14: The Island Battle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
people knew of the ‘Mad Paragon of Pills’, including Azurefiend,
Hegemon Tia, Hegemon Flameleft, and Lord Annihilation. They all knew
how frenzied she could be in the pursuit of her dream… and now, it
was finally going to be realized. They could imagine the emotional
upheaval she felt! This was a happier moment for her than succeeding
in the Daomerge had been. The joy she felt surpassed even life and
death!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Paragon of Pills!” Lord Annihilation said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
congratulations.” Azurefiend chortled as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Tia smiled as she looked at them, but a hint of sorrow flickered in
her eyes. The Paragon’s brothers were about to come back to life,
but her beloved, the one who she viewed as more important than life
itself? It was completely impossible for that person to be brought
back to life. Grief had killed her heart long ago, and the only
reason she hadn’t killed herself was because she had promised to
keep living. Ever since that day, however, she had no longer truly
cared about life, and thus she had dived into one dangerous location
after another, earning the nickname of ‘Mad Hegemon Tia’ in the
rest of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
feeling a bit excited.” The tears quickly dried on the Paragon of
Pills’ face, and she smiled brightly. “I was so worried. I feel
much better now that I know Autarch Skyfeeder has agreed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
Mistress, once we manage to leave this secret dimension, Autarch
Skyfeeder will go with you to the otherverse and reverse spacetime to
revive your three brothers,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
we leave?” The Paragon suddenly frowned. “Darknorth, didn’t you
say this place is incredibly dangerous? Not even the Autarchs will be
able to enter here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Don’t worry. I’ll do everything in my power to get you
out of here, Mistress.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No,
that’s not what I meant. I trust you. But, it’s not guaranteed
that we’ll be able to escape this place,” the Paragon said. “If
I die here, my avatar will die immediately as well. I’ll never be
able to see the three of them again. Even though I know Autarch
Skyfeeder will still reverse spacetime to revive the three of them,
if I’m not able to see it in person… I really can’t accept
this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded. “Then what are you suggesting,
Mistress?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
avatar is alongside Tia and Annihilation’s avatars. I can give you
the location. I’d like to ask Autarch Skyfeeder to go find my
avatar, then take it with her when she revives my three brothers. Is
that acceptable?” the Paragon asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Might
as well.” Ning didn’t refuse, because he himself wasn’t
completely confident that they’d be able to escape this place. He
had been forced to use his own sword-arts multiple times in the
Daoguard Tower area, and they were now in a place that was so
mysterious the Autarchs couldn’t even locate it. This was
definitely a far more dangerous place than the first Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately sent a message to Autarch Skyfeeder, asking for her help.
She agreed, her true body exiting the Quintessence. However, the
Chaosverse was so very large that it would take a bit of time for her
to go find the Paragon of Pills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
scout the surrounding area for now, but make sure to be careful.
Let’s not take any risks just yet. We’ll save that for after your
three brothers are revived,” Ning said with a laugh. The Paragon of
Pills, Hegemon Tia, and the others all acknowledged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning flew into the skies by himself, quickly reaching an altitude of
over a hundred million kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The skies above him were like an enormous azure bowl. Ning frowned
when he stared into them, and he released his Sword Dao Domain to
apply some pressure to the heavens. Alas, the heavens were
incomparably resilient, and they actually pushed back and down
against Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is quite stable. It seems there is no chance at all that I
might be able to tear through this place through raw force.” Ning
quickly came to this determination. As soon as he had arrived here,
he had suspected that this might be the case. This was because even
the ‘Dimensional Hallway Chains’ formed by a single Daoguard
Tower had been incredibly stable. This place was clearly much more
dangerous; there was no way he would be able to break through this
place with ease. Indeed, his test confirmed his suspicions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning flew back down, descending to rejoin Azurefiend, the Paragon of
Pills, Hegemon Tia, and the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do, Daolord?” Lord Annihilation asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way to break through via brute force,” Ning said with a chuckle.
“We’ll need to find some weaknesses in this dimension and then
break through via them. For such a large dimension to be so stable
means that it has to have an internal energy source of some kind or a
formation keeping it together. We’ll be able to escape by
destroying either of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can vaguely sense some living creatures off in the distance.” Ning
pointed towards the horizon ahead of them. “Very weak creatures.
Let’s go take a look.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
weak?” Azurefiend was startled. “How could a terrifying place
like this have weak creatures within it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
they really do seem to be extremely weak. I could probably wipe them
out by breathing on them,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
he had already promised that they wouldn’t do anything dangerous
before reviving the Paragon of Pills’ brothers, Ning was going to
play it safe for now. Given his current level of insight into the
Dao, he was able to sense and avoid danger while seeking out good
fortune! However, the central controls or other critical points in a
hidden realm like this would generally be extremely dangerous, and so
there was no way to ‘avoid danger’ here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sometimes,
you knew the road ahead of you was dangerous but you still had to
take it, because only then would you have a chance at survival!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The group quickly flew into the air. Below them was a vast sea of
water that seemed to be truly boundless and without end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right
here!” Ning quickly came to a halt and stared downwards. Beneath
him was an ‘island’ that was tens of millions of kilometer in
size. Actually, in most places it would have been described as a
‘continent’, but this dimension and the sea it held was so
incredibly vast that this island was nothing more than a tiny little
speck. It wouldn’t be wrong for major powers like Ning to refer to
it as an ‘island’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
island had countless living beings thriving within it. Ning stared
downwards, his gaze quickly locking onto the most powerful being in
this entire island.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a wilderness region, three humanoids were battling against a
vilefiend who was dressed in long black robes. He was fairly handsome
and exuded an aura of charisma, but in battle he was indescribably
ferocious and savage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
humans have killed me many times, but you’ll never be able to kill
me permanently. I’ll come back to life time and time again! Ahaha!
I can fail any number of times, but you cannot fail even once…
because if you do, I’ll butcher every living person on this entire
continent. Ahahaha! Want to know a little secret? I’ve actually
already done it on five different occasions in history!” The
vilefiend’s voice was sharp and shrill. “This will be my sixth
time. If you want to survive, you should bow down to me. I need a few
lackies, after all. I don’t like you, but you are fairly strong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Forget
about it! This continent belongs to us Sithe! We would never allow a
vilefiend like yourself to run rampant here!” The leader of the
three was a six-armed man who was furiously attacking with six giant
warhammers. Alas, the vilefiend was far too fast and nimble; if it
wasn’t for the other two party members, the leader would’ve been
defeated long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second member of the party was a red-haired man who wielded a
warblade and whose entire body was bathed in flames. He howled
furiously, “The valiant men of the Sithe shall never succumb to a
vilefiend like yourself!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
final member of the party was a gray-robed woman, and she had an icy
look on her face as she controlled her magic treasures to attack from
afar. She said in a frozen voice, “We Sithe would rather all die in
battle than submit to a vilefiend like yourself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
the Paragon of Pills, Azurefiend, and the rest all watched from high
up in the skies, rather shocked by all of this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
‘valiant men of the Sithe’?” Ning blinked. “Why does that
phrase feel so… odd?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
‘Sithe would rather all die in battle than submit to a vilefiend’?”
Azurefiend mumbled to himself, “That’s a pretty determined
statement! I had no idea the Sithe were so intrepid.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three humanoids below them were merely of the Elder God/Ancestral
Immortal level, while the vilefiend was an extremely weak member of
the vilefiend race. There was an enormous degree of difference
between it and the vilefiends Ning encountered near the Daoguard
Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was nothing more than a battle at the Elder God level. To the likes
of Ning, the Paragon of Pills, Azurefiend, Lord Annihilation, Hegemon
Flameleft, or Hegemon Tia, these four were all very puny! And yet,
they were the most powerful beings on this island. Ning was telling
the truth earlier when he said that they were ‘very weak’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha!”
Lord Annihilation laughed as well. “To us cultivators as a whole,
the Sithe are a calamity, a nightmare, a blight on existence! The
Sithe, however, also have weak members of the race who are akin to
our mortals. Perhaps they find pride in being Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
call themselves Sithe, but they aren’t actually true Sithe,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
aren’t true Sithe?” Everyone present stared at Ning, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
how is it that you know this?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t explain any further, because this involved many hidden
secrets that would only cause Azurefiend and the others to feel
unnecessary consternation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they were true Sithe, they would be rejected by all the prime
essences of the Chaosverse, making it impossible for them to use the
power of the Dao! However, all three of the humans below them were
infusing the Dao into each and every strike. They weren’t rejected
by the prime essences!</P>

Chapter 15: Filthy</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
you hear that? That little vilefiend just said he’s wiped out all
life on this island several times,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unsurprising,”
Ji Ning replied. “This hidden dimension is within the Sithelands,
which means that vilefiends can arise here! Although they are fairly
weak without the power of a Daoguard Tower behind them, they are
still enough to be absolute catastrophes for islands like this. In
addition, vilefiends have essence springs located in other places. I
can kill them with my sword and then locate and destroy their essence
springs via karma, but the living beings on this island can only use
all their strength to fight and kill the vilefiend time and time
again without being able to truly exterminate it. Given enough time,
the vilefiend will rise to power once more and then cause yet another
calamity to descend upon this island.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills sighed. “Vilefiends are nothing to us, but they
represent apocalypse to the countless beings on this island.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Tia said, “Perhaps this is a method the Sithe use to train and
temper the members of their race.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…Yes,
that’s extremely possible.” Ning’s eyes lit up. Applying
pressure via vilefiends could result in more powerful experts arising
more frequently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
they spoke, Ning and the others descended onto the island.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
launch an all-out assault!” The three humans were beginning to
unleash their desperation attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha…
desperation attacks? I’ll give you one final blow and annihilate
any hope that you might still harbor. I’m looking forward to those
looks of despair on your face, the despair that stems from the very
depths of your soul… I can’t help but feel excited when I see
those looks!” The vilefiend was actually shaking from anticipation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly…
slash! A streak of sword-light sliced through the vilefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vilefiend’s face still had that look of twisted joy on it, but a
heartbeat later it completely disintegrated into dust. Ning’s sword
followed the karma lines attaching it to its essence spring,
destroying that as well. From this day forth, the vilefiend which had
troubled this island and its many living beings for countless
generations was no more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Helping
you kill that vilefiend is a form of recompense for rifling through
your memories.” Ning began to search through the memories of those
three ‘Sithe’ humans. The fact that their attacks were infused
with the power of the Dao meant that they were also natives of this
Chaosverse, and so Ning treated them as humans rather than as Sithe.
This was why he wished to ‘repay’ them for what he was doing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
now that you’ve killed that vilefiend, this island won’t suffer
any more attacks. Doesn’t that mean that the tempering trial the
Sithe set up is over?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t give a shit,” Ning said casually.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
blinked. The Paragon of Pills, Hegemon Tia, Hegemon Flameleft, and
Lord Annihilation all stared at Ning in shock. ‘I don’t give a
shit’… how could words like this have come from the mouth of the
peerlessly dazzling ‘Daolord Darknorth’?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were many Emperors and Hegemons with foul dispositions and even
fouler language. However, to the people present, Darknorth was a
person of incomparably exalted stature, someone who was very nearly a
peer of the Autarchs. They couldn’t help but feel a bit
uncomfortable when they heard Ning say this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning had a completely perfect Dao-heart. He’d say whatever
he felt without needing to disguise it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Um.
So what have you discovered?” the Paragon of Pills asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are just Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. They know very little…
but their memories do contain information regarding a legendary and
‘invincible’ figure who controls all sixty-three islands in this
vast territory. That person is known to them as Archfiend Huabo, and
he is so ‘unfathomably powerful’ that he has never been defeated
and can wipe out an entire island with a wave of his hand.” Ning
snickered. “Their memories indicate that Archfiend Huabo should
know more about this place than them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others left, and as they did the three humans regained
consciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
just happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where’s
the vilefiend?” All three of them were completely puzzled. When
Ning had rifled through their memories, it hadn’t had a negative
impact on them at all. It was like a brief moment of unconsciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archfiend
Huabo was the ruler of sixty-three islands, and in truth he was a
Daolord of the Fourth Step. In this era and amongst these weak
cultivators, he truly was ‘invincible’! But to Ning and his team?
A Daolord of the Fourth Step was still extremely weak, so weak that
he could be exterminated with just a breath!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archfiend
Huabo was seated on his royal throne. Below him was a large number of
beautiful women who were dancing for him, while at each side of the
hall there were many chained beings who were being tortured and
tormented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had an extremely strange personality and temperament. He was the
undisputed hegemon of these sixty-three islands, and countless living
beings had been tortured to death by him. He delighted in torture, in
hearing their final screams and cries. This was what made him smile,
and was the reason why he was known as the ‘Archfiend’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
smile on his face, he watched the beautiful women dance while
listening to the viperous curses and blubbering wails of his
prisoners.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
fools. All of them ran off to the Sacred Realm, and for what? The
Sacred Realm has many powerful experts there; we’d be nothing more
than the crust on their boots,” Archfiend Huabo mused. “Staying
behind is a much better decision. I’m virtually invincible here and
can do whatever I want. Isn’t that wonderful? As for the Daomerge…
hmph! Did they really think they would succeed in the Daomerge just
because major powers in the Sacred Realm will provide them guidance?
I hear that their success rates remain pitifully low.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Staying
behind is definitely the better choice, ehehe… tomorrow, I’ll go
capture a few more people. The ones in the prison have almost all
died out by now.” Archfiend Huabo was in a superb mood. As for the
beautiful dancers, all of them were quivering in fear, even if none
of them dared to reveal it. They did their best to please the
almighty Archfiend, for fear of being tortured to death as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a total of six people walked into the hall. The dance came to a halt,
and the smile on Archfiend Huabo’s face suddenly froze. Even the
steam coming from the cup of mulled wine by his side froze in midair.
Time itself seemed to stop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
six figures walking in were Ji Ning, the Paragon of Pills,
Azurefiend, Hegemon Tia, Hegemon Flameleft, and Lord Annihilation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Dao Domain had sealed down spacetime itself, causing time to
freeze completely. The dancers and the Archfiend would have no
recollection at all of what happened in this moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
take a look at their memories.” Ning was able to easily rifle
through this Daolord’s memories. He finished after a few moments,
then fell completely silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
does it look?” The others all looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is going to be troublesome,” Ning said, then chuckled. “But we
knew that from the beginning. Simply put, this Daolord’s memories
indicate that this hidden dimension has a total of six ‘realms’
where mortals live, as well as an exalted ‘Sacred Realm’ and an
evil, desolate ‘Purgatory’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Together,
the six mortal worlds, the Sacred Realm, and Purgatory form this
entire hidden dimension,” Ning said. “At least, that’s what he
believes and his memories indicate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
six mortal realms are all extremely vast and are filled with
countless mortals and many cultivators. However, only cultivators who
become Samsara Daolords are qualified to enter the Sacred Realm! Of
course, there are many Samsara Daolords who choose to stay behind in
the six mortal realms instead, but if they DO succeed in the Daomerge
and become Eternal Emperors, they are required to enter the Sacred
Realm,” Ning said. “If they do not, then major powers shall
descend from the Sacred Realm to capture and then punish them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills frowned: “It seems as though the ‘Sacred Realm’
is where all the major powers of this hidden dimension are gathered.
What of this ‘Purgatory’, then?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Purgatory is the place where extremely evil people and people who are
being punished by the major powers shall be exiled to! That place is
both dangerous and desolate,” Ning said. “My guess is that the
most important parts of this dimension reside within the ‘Sacred
Realm’!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
most powerful people present in the six mortal realms were Daolords
of the Fourth Step. The Sacred Realm was where the true major powers
had gathered, which meant that there was a 99% chance that the core
control mechanisms of this hidden dimension were located there as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
the countless living beings of this dimension truly Sithe progeny?
And what is the history of this place?” Hegemon Flameleft asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
not information a Daolord of the Fourth Step like him would know,”
Ning said with a chuckle. “What we need to do is to head into the
Sacred Realm!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred Realm… it was undoubtedly filled with many major powers and
terrifying Sithe traps. Ning wouldn’t be surprised if it had ten
Daoguard Towers within it! Once they headed off to the Sacred Realm,
a war would probably break out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can we get there?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Through
the ‘Realmgate’,” Ning said. “However, now is not yet the
time. Let’s wait for the Mistress’ three brothers to be revived
before we head off to the Realmgate and enter the Sacred Realm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning glanced at Archfiend Huabo, who was still seated on his
throne with a frozen grin on his face, then waved a finger. A streak
of sword-light shot out, passing through the Archfiend’s skull and
destroying his soul and truesoul. From this day forth, Archfiend
Huabo, who had been the hegemon of these sixty-three islands for
countless years, died as a result of people who literally came out of
nowhere. Even as he died, he had no idea what was happening or who
was killing him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“M-master…
you already looked through his memories. Why’d you kill him?”
Azurefiend stared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was precisely because I looked through his memories that I killed
him.” Ning shook his head and muttered, “Absolutely filthy. I
really couldn’t help myself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
group quietly slipped away, leaving behind a palace in a state of
chaos.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_016__The"></A>
Chapter 16: Spacetime Reversal Resurrection</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Roughly
five months after Ji Ning’s group had first been sent into this
hidden dimension, Autarch Skyfeeder brought the avatars of the
Paragon of Pills and Lord Annihilation to the otherverse they resided
in. It was time to begin the process of reversing spacetime and
reviving those three Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Annihilation’s otherverse. The Archaeus Region. The Prime Reaches
of the Genesis Lands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a place filled with corpses, all of whom had failed in the
struggle over the control of this otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
gentle-eyed and slightly plump Autarch Skyfeeder glanced at the
various Emperor-class corpses within the Prime Reaches as the avatars
of the Paragon and Lord Annihilation stood respectfully to one side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Looks
like this was quite a bitter battle,” Autarch Skyfeeder said. “This
is an otherverse which I created extremely, extremely early on. I
didn’t put it within the Eight Domains, which is why only a few
Hegemons took part in this struggle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Domain and the rest of the Eight Domains had so many experts
present that the members of most squads were usually at the Hegemonic
level. Every so often, you would also see an Otherverse Lord or
someone in control of a powerful Sithe weapon. Thus, when two
competing teams found an otherverse to fight over, the battle would
involve ten or so Hegemons!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the Prime Reaches here only held three Hegemonic corpses, as well as
quite a few ordinary Eternal Emperors. It was indeed a bitter battle,
but the power of the combatants involved was somewhat lower than what
would be seen in the Eight Domains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Otherverses
are incredibly rare outside the Eight Domains,” the avatar of the
Paragon of Pills said softly. “The appearance of this otherverse
caused everyone to go wild. The four Hegemons who were the first to
arrived each brought subordinates and were willing to risk everything
for the sake of this otherverse. A great battle broke out, and in the
end Hegemon Dustfall was the one who won. My three brothers covered
me, letting me escape, but the ones who were left behind were all
suppressed and bound by the power of this otherverse, which now had a
master. Nothing awaited them save death, and they knew it. Hegemon
Dustfall was kind enough to allow each of the Emperors a chance to
leave behind a legacy, and he also let their corpses remain intact.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
Otherverse Lord who was inside of his otherverse would be
dramatically more powerful than when he was outside in the ‘normal’
world. The otherverse was his territory, and the overwhelming power
of the otherverse ensured that he himself would also be incredibly
strong! This was why the Lonely King instantly became famous after
chasing someone into an otherverse, then destroying it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Hegemons? When directly suppressed by the power of an otherverse,
they wouldn’t even be able to move a finger!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
shortly after Dustfall acquired this otherverse, he died while
adventuring in a dangerous place. You ended up lucking out,
Annihilation.” The Paragon of Pills glanced at Lord Annihilation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was just a matter of speed, but I admit that my luck wasn’t bad.”
Lord Annihilation smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to begin now,” Autarch Skyfeeder said. “Just stand there
and watch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The avatars of Lord Annihilation and the Paragon of Pills both nodded
respectfully, with a look of excitement appearing in the eyes of the
latter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder stared towards the Sword Hegemon, still leaning against his
enormous dark-blue greatsword. Behind him was the white-robed man who
had three swords on his back as well as the azure-armored man who had
planted nine blood-colored swords into the ground before him. Time
quickly began to slow, stop, and then reverse in the area around
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Countless images went past, including the images of
Ning’s arrival within this region. Just a short while later, it had
reversed all the way to the earliest and most ancient days of this
otherverse. This was when the three had fallen in battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
beloved friends all died in this battle. There is no way I will
pardon you or release you.” In the temporally inverted images
before them, they were able to see a valiant old man dressed in
silvery-white armor who stood high up on a mountain. “However… I
don’t blame you for doing what you did. All of us were trying to
take this otherverse. I simply was the one to win. I’ll give you
all some time to make your final preparations; make sure you don’t
waste this time. I’ll also set down barriers to ensure that your
corpses will not be disturbed in the many eons to come.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of the Hegemons or Emperors tried to argue with him. This truly had
been a bitter battle with many deaths; it was already quite
magnanimous that the victor was giving them time to pass down
legacies for themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother… second brother… we were so close! I still can’t
believe this,” said the azure-armored man who had planted those
nine blood-colored swords in the earth before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t matter how close we were. We lost. At least we three
brothers will be able to die together.” The white-robed man had a
smile on his face. Clearly, he had already accepted his fate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
was all my fault.” The muscular greatsword-bearing Hegemon let out
a sigh, but his eyes were quite peaceful as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the Paragon of Pills saw and heard this, her eyes turned moist. She
tightly clenched her hands together, continuing to watch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Freeze!”
Autarch Skyfeeder stared at the image before them, causing time to
freeze before her. In this frozen moment, the three of them were
still alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spacetime,
reverse. Truesouls, return!” Autarch Skyfeeder turned quite solemn
as well. The truesoul fragments of this Hegemon, along with the
truesoul fragments of the other two Emperors behind him, had all been
swallowed by the prime essences of this otherverse and hidden at its
very core. They had become one with the otherverse itself! What she
was doing right now was akin to tearing out part of a stone tower’s
foundation; if not done correctly, it was quite possible that the
tower itself would crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was easy to swallow something and digest it, but very hard to drag it
back out. Not even Lord Annihilation, the master of this otherverse,
would be able to accomplish it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thankfully,
Autarch Skyfeeder had been the person who created this otherverse.
Even if she did wreck it, she would be able to repair it. Right now,
all she needed to do was to keep it stable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gather!”
Autarch Skyfeeder barked out a second time. This time, countless
truesoul fragments began to fly out from the deepest part of the
Prime Reaches, then levitate into the air. The Prime Reaches was the
location where the prime essences of this Otherverse were located.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Visually,
the truesoul fragments looked like tiny little motes of light. These
countless little motes of light all flew towards the three standing
Emperors. As more light appeared and as spacetime continued to
advance, the bodies of the three formerly-illusory figures quickly
began to solidify.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the earth throughout the Prime Reaches began to shudder. In fact, the
entire massive otherverse began to tremble slightly. Lord
Annihilation turned pale as he continued to watch nervously. This was
his otherverse; if it collapsed, he would be doomed. But all he could
do was look at Autarch Skyfeeder, not daring to make a sound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder herself remained quite calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Big
brother! The Paragon of Pills watched this all excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three figures grew increasingly solid as more and more light poured
into them, and their auras became increasingly real as well. A hint
of light appeared within their eyes, a light which represented life
and sentience.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Finally, all three auras completely stabilized, and a
look of shock appeared in the eyes of the Hegemon and his two
brothers. Alive! They were alive again!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother. Second brother. Third brother.” Overwhelmed with
excitement, the Paragon of Pills charged straight towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder had made use of their three undamaged corpses to bring them
fully back to life. If their bodies were gone, she still would’ve
been able to revive them, but it would’ve taken more effort;
recreating a Hegemonic body was no easy feat, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Little
sister.” The greatsword-bearing man looked at the Paragon of Pills,
then at his two nearby brothers. “Second brother. Third brother.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills wrapped her arms tightly around the muscular man.
She had endured many, many things after her three brothers had died.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Little
sister.” The muscular man hugged the Paragon of Pills back, a
complex look on his face. They weren’t true siblings, they just
referred to each other that way as a term of endearment. In truth,
they were lovers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we’ve come back to life! Hahaha, we’ve all come back to life!”
The azure-armored man was the most excited of the three.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother. Third brother. Little sister,” the white-robed man sent
mentally to them, his gaze focused on the distant Autarch Skyfeeder,
“It was the Autarch who brought us back to life, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was the calmest of the three who had just been brought back to life.
The Paragon of Pills quickly came back to her senses. She hurriedly
turned and bowed gratefully towards Autarch Skyfeeder, “Thank you,
Autarch, for saving my three brothers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Autarch, for saving our lives,” the Hegemon and his two
Emperors said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive.
You were actually able to convince an Autarch to come rescue the
three of us… and it looks as though you yourself have become a
Hegemon, little sister,” the azure-armored man sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder said with a calm smile on her face, “I came at
Darknorth’s request. Of course I took it seriously! Alright, now
that this matter is finished, it is time for me to go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Safe
travels, Autarch.” Lord Annihilation let out a sigh of relief.
Autarchs truly were impressive; his otherverse had been barely
affected by this process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Safe
travels, Autarch.” The Paragon of Pills and the others all bowed
respectfully once more. Autarch Skyfeeder took a single step, then
disappeared into the void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
congratulations, my friends!” Lord Annihilation smiled as he bowed
towards the three brothers. “I imagine there are many things the
Paragon of Pills wishes to talk to you about. I won’t bother you
any further. When you are free, you must come and be my guests at the
Church of Annihilation.” Lord Annihilation’s avatar then took a
step away, disappearing into the void as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Little
sister, you truly are incredible.” The azure-armored man was still
extremely excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the muscular man, he continued to hold the Paragon of Pills’
hand in an affectionate display of love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Little
sister, the Autarch said that she came on the request of ‘Darknorth’?
Who is this ‘Darknorth’? He must be a major power. Is he an
Autarch as well?” the white-robed man asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
Based on what I know, it is almost impossible to convince an Autarch
to help revive a Hegemon.” The muscular man couldn’t help but ask
as well: “Who exactly is this ‘Darknorth’ fellow? He was able
to have an Autarch carry out tasks for him… and apparently, didn’t
even come in person?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_017__The"></A>
Chapter 17: Assaulting the Realmgate</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
you were going to ask someone to help you out with something, you
would at least show up yourself, right? This was doubly true when you
were asking an Autarch to help out. How much face were the Autarchs
giving this ‘Darknorth’ fellow, for them to show up even when he
himself did not?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.”
The Paragon of Pills laughed. “Darknorth is a Daolord, a Daolord
who has failed the Daomerge… but he is extremely close to the
Autarchs in actual power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
The three were astonished and unable to believe this. A Daolord who
had failed the Daomerge? They felt no regard at all for people like
that… but one who was close to the Autarchs in power? They couldn’t
even imagine how this was possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemons
are nothing more than ants to him. He doesn’t even need to strike
them in order to kill them! Only someone like the Lonely King of the
Icepeak Army is worthy of him attacking, but he only needed to strike
a single time to slay the Lonely King,” the Paragon of Pills said.
“He is on extremely good terms with the Autarchs, and he was the
one who convinced Autarch Skyfeeder to come here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Her
three ‘brothers’ were truly flabbergasted by this. This Darknorth
was truly an incredible figure!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
fact… big brother,” the Paragon of Pills said with a chortle,
“He’s actually one of your honorary disciples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
Mine?” The muscular man stared at her, his eyes popping wide. “My
honorary disciple?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
hidden dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since Ji Ning and the others had discovered that this dimension was
divided up into six mortal realms, a ‘Sacred Realm’, and a
‘Purgatory’, they had begun to relax and wander through the
mortal realms. The plan was to wait until the Paragon of Pills’
three brothers were revived before risking entry into the Realmgate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Paragon of Pills.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Mistress.” Ji Ning, Azurefiend, Tia, Flameleft, and Annihilation
all offered their congratulations. They even prepared congratulatory
gifts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them could clearly sense how the Paragon of Pills’ aura had
changed. In the past, she had seemed so solitary, cold, and remote.
Now, it was like winter had left and spring had come. She had an
uncontrollable smile on her face, and her joy was absolutely
infectious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I’ve met them again, I truly have no regrets left.” The
Paragon looked at Ning. “Darknorth, I have to thank you for
everything.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
it wasn’t for the insights I gained in the Archaeus Region and the
help you provided, Mistress, I might not necessarily have been able
to embark upon the path of the Omega Dao,” Ning said. “I wouldn’t
have reached my current level of power either.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he was allowed to choose again between success in the Daomerge and
becoming a Hegemon (via fused Supreme Daos) or failure in the
Daomerge but mastering the Eternal Omega Dao, he would probably still
choose the latter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why?
Because… if even the Autarchs were unable to revive Yu Wei, the
Omega Dao was the only chance he had! Even though he failed, he would
still be an incandescently dazzling figure for over ten thousand
chaos cycles. As far as Ning was concerned, this was superior to an
eternity of mediocrity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills had no further regrets in life. Now, she was able to
face all dangers with complete calmness and equanimity, meeting even
death with a smile on her face. Ning, however, was even more
determined to ensure the Paragon’s safety! She had just reunited
with her beloved brothers; if she was to die here, wouldn’t that be
a truly painful farewell?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
Hegemons died, it would be virtually impossible to bring them back to
life. Her big brother had only been revived because he had died
within an otherverse. If the Paragon of Pills died here, there would
be no way she could be brought back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
They soared through the air and quickly reached the location of the
Realmgate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
here is the Realmgate.” They had spent several months scanning
through the memories of many different Daolords. As a result, they
were able to recognize it right away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
we were teleported directly into this dimension. I imagine the true
ruler of this dimension was made aware of our appearance long ago,”
Azurefiend said. “Prior to this, we were in the mortal realm.
There’s nothing in the mortal realm which can pose a threat to us,
and so the controller of this dimension was unable to touch us from
afar, nor would he dare to actually attack you directly. But once we
go through the Realmgate and reach the Sacred Realm, things will be
different. We’ll be surrounded by danger.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Ning nodded. He had long ago prepared for the likelihood that the
master of this place was aware of his presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Travelling
to the Sacred Realm is our only hope,” the Paragon of Pills said.
“Darknorth, you are so very strong that the Sithe experts hiding in
this place would never dare to challenge you to a fair fight. That’s
why they haven’t attacked yet! Our records indicate that when
Daolords dare to disobey orders from the Sacred Realm, powerful
experts will descend to seize and punish them. This means it is
possible for Sithe experts to descend upon this place… but they
have not! Why? Because they fear you, Darknorth. But you failed your
Daomerge, which means that you will eventually die from your truesoul
crumbling away. Once that happens, the Sithe will probably attack and
kill the rest of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not willing to spend the rest of my life in these mortal realms
either,” Ning said with a chuckle. In a fair fight, not even Sithe
Exalts were a match for him. Even if four or five Exalts attacked
him, given his speed and agility, if he focused on dodging then they
wouldn’t even be able to touch his clothes. The difference in
ability between them was enormous!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
if their opponents were aided by Daoguard Towers? That would make
this extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
advance via realmship,” Ning said as he produced his realmship. All
six of them entered the realmship. They did this not because they
needed it to travel, but because they wanted to benefit from the
extra layer of protection it provided. Realmships were extremely
sturdy, after all; breaching them was no easy task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Realmgate was a hundred thousand kilometers high and utterly massive.
It emanated dazzling light and was shaped like a giant door, and
around it space was twisted and distorted into multiple folds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning and the others flew forwards via realmship, protected and
surrounded by Ning’s Sword Dao Domain. As they moved closer to the
gate, they could sense that the twisted dimensional folds were
impeding their advance. To Ning, however, they were like nothing more
than a spring breeze, incapable of barring his path in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
heading in. Be careful, everyone.” Ning could sense his
subconscious warning him of danger, but there was nothing he could
do. This was their only chance to escape and survive this place.
Delay and buy time? There was no way he could out-delay the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship finally flew into the iridescent Realmgate. It quickly made
its way completely inside the gate, only to see an extremely stable
tunnel which was formed through many layers of folded dimensional
space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship flew through this stable dimensional tunnel at high
speeds. Given Ning’s current level of power, he was able to see
past all obstacles and make out the awesome aura of the world off in
the distance… the ‘Sacred Realm’. The aura of the Sacred Realm
was noticeably vaster and more powerful, and it held far more experts
as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
Crack! Crack! Suddenly, the formerly-stable tunnel began to shatter
apart as two strange triangular weapons appeared in the sides of the
dimensional folds off in the distance. Two more appeared within the
sides of the dimensional tunnel behind Ning as well. It was their
appearance which caused the dimensional tunnel to begin to crack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Ning’s face tightened. He didn’t hesitate at all,
immediately expanding his Sword Dao Domain dramatically in size,
causing a large amount of sword-light to appear and furiously assault
the four triangular weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
four triangular weapons all had sharp edges which shot out rays of
light. These rays of light were extremely thin and allowed them to
easily tear through space. There was no way Ning’s Sword Dao Domain
could resist the four streaks of light; each streak of light
represented an enormous amount of energy and power, and all four of
them shot out to Ning’s realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a terrifying weapon.” Ning immediately willed the realmship to move
in an erratic pattern as it flowed through the crumbling and chaotic
tunnel, moving from one position to another. The realmship itself was
like a sword which was being used to display a truly marvelous
sword-art.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! All four rays of light shot past the
realmship, not able to touch it at all. “Thank goodness I mastered
the Space Sword Dao.” Ning let out a sigh of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were within a dimensional tunnel; as the tunnel crumbled, space here
became increasingly chaotic. Those four triangular weapons had just
launched attacks with extremely thin dimensional blades, and by all
rights it should’ve been nearly impossible for someone to dodge
them unharmed in such a chaotic environment. Ning, however, had
achieved just that thanks to his Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Those four triangular weapons suddenly expanded
dramatically in size as they charged towards Ning’s realmship. Ning
could sense the enormous threat they posed. As for Azurefiend, the
Paragon of Pills, and the others within the realmship, they could do
nothing save watch. They wouldn’t even able to react in time
against attacks of this level!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here.” Ning instantly emerged from the realmship, then drew it
back into his estate-world. There was no way he could simply rely on
the realmship to deal with those triangular weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Snick.
Ning drew a Northbow sword from the sheath on his back. “Hm. I
can’t let them get close to me. They seem to possess the ability to
self-detonate.” At Ning’s current level, he was able to vaguely
see what some future possibilities would be. Thus, Ning suddenly
tossed his sword out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooosh!
Ning tossed the sword out like a whip, sending a gentle stream of
sword-light sweeping out like a beautiful creek. The water glowed in
a dazzling manner as it lashed through the air, gently rapping
against the surface of one of the triangular weapons. That triangular
weapon couldn’t help but be nudged off-course to one side, clashing
against one of the other triangular weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
more playing around.” Ning glanced at the nearly-collapsed
dimensional tunnel around him. Ahead of them was the end of the
tunnel and the Sacred Realm. He immediately used his sword-arts to
forcibly charge through all opposition and make it outside.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_018__The"></A>
Chapter 18: Dimensional Seams</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seal!”
A cold voice suddenly rang out from the Sacred Realm in front of
them. A streak of light shot out from the Sacred Realm, forming a
membrane in front of it that denied entry. A moment later, the four
triangular weapons surrounding Ji Ning suddenly unleashed a blast of
utterly terrifying power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
four triangular weapons released all of the power held within them in
a final explosion, blasting apart and sending shrapnel in every
direction and creating a zone of death around them! There was no way
one could avoid this zone attack, as the entire area was filled with
explosive waves of power. Even the Blazesun Ruler would’ve been
reduced to dust if enveloped by such powerful explosions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
actually detonated such incredibly valuable treasures?” Ning held a
single Northbow sword at the ready. Swoosh! He suddenly sent out a
swirl of sword-light that chopped through the space surrounding him
like tofu, causing it to ripple and form into a dimensional barrier
which surrounded and protected him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to go.” Ning wasn’t going to just stand there like a fool. Swish!
Using his Dao of Space, Ning transformed himself into a dimensional
shard that fled off into the distance! When any of the explosive
power struck him, the dimensional barrier surrounding Ning would
simply deflect it with a slight ripple. This level of power might be
able to easily breach the defenses of a Sithe Exalt or the Blazesun
Ruler, but the defensive power of Ning’s Space Sword Dao was far
too great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
given enough time, the power would still be depleted and exhausted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the dimensional tunnel had been completely disintegrated, while the
four terrifying triangular weapons had exploded apart into countless
little shards. Ning rapidly flew away from this region, ensuring that
the detonations were unable to harm him in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Ning came to a halt. Northbow sword in hand and
Sword Dao Domain surrounding him, Ning scanned the nearby area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the seam between the eight realms, eh?” Ning mused to
himself. Now that the dimensional tunnel had been destroyed, Ning was
trapped within the seam between the realms. Space was incredibly
chaotic and twisted here, but given Ning’s level of mastery he
wasn’t impeded by it at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning used his Sword Dao Domain to separate the surrounding dangers
from himself, then quickly advanced towards the front. A short while
later, he saw an enormous membrane. Behind it, he could vaguely make
out a vast world filled with incredible amounts of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sacred Realm.” Ning immediately knew that the world beyond the
membrane had to be the ‘Sacred Realm’, but the dimensional
membrane was incredibly tough; Ning didn’t even need to test it
with his Sword Dao Domain to know that there was no chance of using
it to punch through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
the membranes surrounding the six mortal realms of this hidden
dimension were incredibly tough and durable. If I couldn’t break
through them, I have no chance at all at this one around the Sacred
Realm,” Ning mused. “The six mortal realms, the Sacred Realm, and
Purgatory have all been completely sealed off. Does that mean I’ve
been trapped here permanently?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No,
that can’t be right. The Sithe wouldn’t do such a thing.” Ning
quickly came to this realization. If the Sithe had merely wanted to
trap him, they could’ve simply sealed off the Realmgate and kept
Ning permanently trapped within the ordinary realm he was in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go check out the other places.” Ning flew through the vast
realm-seam, moving towards some of the other realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the supreme world which was used to control this hidden
dimension. Many powerful Sithe were located here, and at the center
of this world was a trio of towering mountains. Each mountain had a
pagoda at the peak, and each pagoda was exactly twelve stories tall!
They all emanated auras of dazzling light that caused spacetime to
ripple and twist within the area of their illumination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
were the three Elder Palaces which the most mysterious and most
exalted denizens of the Sacred Realm dwelt. However, the auras of two
Elder Palaces were rather dim and weak; only one of them continued to
radiate an aura of incandescent splendor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the brightest Elder Palace. A large group of experts were standing
within it, staring through the palace gates to the world outside. At
their head stood a youth dressed in deep blue robes. His hair was
deep blue while his was face grim and cold. He held his hands behind
his back, standing ramrod-straight and emanating an awesome aura.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
failed.” The blue-haired youth frowned. “It really is hard to get
rid of someone in control of an Eternal Omega Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt.”
Some of the Hegemons and Emperors standing behind him had undergone
the Ritual Sacrificium, and one of the Hegemons spoke out: “Exalt,
where did this white-robed Daolord come from? We detonated four
Calamity-class weapons but still were unable to do anything to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough.”
The blue-haired youth waved his hand, then turned to stare at the
Hegemons and Emperors behind him. He said in a calm voice, “We
failed our first attempt, which means it is now up to Purgatory to
act! If Purgatory succeeds, this matter shall be at an end. If
Purgatory fails, we’ll have no choice but to draw him into the
Sacred Realm and resolve this through battle!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
why? He’s a Daolord who failed the Daomerge. His truesoul is
crumbling away! So long as we keep him completely sealed within these
eight realms and ensure that he is trapped within the realm-seam,
he’ll die of natural causes,” a red-robed youth said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he really did die of natural causes, that would be an absolute
waste.” The blue-haired youth shook his head. “I’m not going to
explain any further. We have to do everything in our power to kill
him, even if it costs us our very lives! No price is too great to pay
if it means killing him. This is our responsibility as Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the red-robed youth said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Send
word to Purgatory,” the blue-haired youth said. “Once the
white-robed Daolord reaches Purgatory, Purgatory is to send all of
the exiles against him. If they can kill the white-robed Daolord,
they’ll not only be allowed to come back to the Sacred Realm,
they’ll also be heavily rewarded. As for the person who actually
managed to kill the Daolord… I’ll give him control over one of
the two Elder Halls.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Control
over an Elder Hall?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“T-that’s
not appropriate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can an exile be worthy of controlling an Elder Hall?” Everyone in
the hall began to speak out in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blue-haired youth swept them with his icy gaze, quickly silencing
them all. He explained calmly, “Tell them that the white-robed
Daolord is incredibly powerful; their only option is to kill him
through exhaustion and attrition. They also need to remember to keep
the Soul-Eating Mantra active at all times! They need to make sure
that they swallow all of the truesoul fragments that are breaking off
of him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalts
were not to be questioned or challenged. Long ago, this hidden
dimension actually had a total of three Exalts. Later on, this
dimension had sent out a grand army to take part in the war, with two
of the Exalts personally leading that army. This Exalt had been left
behind to guard the hidden dimension… but alas, those two departed
Exalts had never returned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blue-haired youth turned and departed. With his departure, the
Hegemons and Emperors left in the hall quickly scattered as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
leaving the hall, two Sithe Hegemons began to quietly whisper amongst
themselves while they walked out side-by-side. “This is a Daolord
in control of an Eternal Omega Dao. If we can somehow kill him, we’ll
be given unimaginable rewards.” These two Hegemons were extremely
excited. “This is doubly true for the Exalt. Even if he dies, once
his truesoul returns home, he’ll be rewarded by being brought back
to life via spacetime reversal. No wonder the Exalt is so excited
over this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Reviving
an Exalt was incredibly difficult, but the Sithe Lord of Chaos was
capable of it. However, this would cause a degree of injury to the
prime essences of that Chaosverse; generally speaking, a Lord of
Chaos would be unwilling to make that sort of sacrifice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
if one accomplished great deeds, one had to be rewarded for it!
Killing someone who was in control of an Eternal Omega Dao was viewed
as a slightly greater deed than even killing an Autarch would be! If
they were successful, then the Exalt would not only be brought back
to life, he would be given many gifts as well. It truly would be a
case of him rising to preeminence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
that Daolord is terrifyingly strong. Otherwise, we’d charge out and
kill him ourselves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
he’s absolutely terrifying. Not even the Exalt dares to challenge
him. He’s in control of an Eternal Omega Dao, and this is his
Chaosverse. With the support of the Dao, he’s virtually
invincible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
his truesoul is crumbling away! The more he fights, the faster the
truesoul will break apart. That’s why the exiles in Purgatory have
a chance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
the Exalt was quite odd about this. Why did he say that the person
who killed the white-robed Daolord would be allowed to take control
over an Elder Hall? Many of the exiles were local natives. Is he
really going to let a local take control over an Elder Hall? They
might be our progeny, but they were born in this Chaosverse, not our
own; that makes them native to this Chaosverse, and they are born
with power over the Dao. If we let one of them take control over an
Elder Hall, that person might become a source of trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, our progeny swore long ago not to betray us. And… in the
end, they are our children. They share our blood. Why would they view
us as enemies?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are still natives; they aren’t true Sithe like us. They belong to
this Chaosverse, while we belong to a different one. In the end, this
is an insurmountable difference.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we Sithe gave birth to them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough,
enough. Let’s not argue about this.” These two Hegemons were not
native to this hidden dimension. Rather, they had invaded this
Chaosverse alongside the grand Sithe army.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
the true Sithe viewed the ‘Sithe progeny’ in this hidden
dimension as being different from them.</P>

Chapter 19: Inside Purgatory</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Purgatory.
Many exiled major powers were here, many of whom were Hegemons or
Emperors. Although there were many Daolords who would be exiled here,
the vast majority of them would fail the Daomerge and die! They might
be Sithe progeny, but they were born within this Chaosverse and thus
incapable training in true Sithe techniques. The Sithe, in turn, were
unable to create a set of perfect training techniques that was suited
to this Chaosverse. They were diametrically incompatible with it,
after all. They would constantly be suppressed and weakened by the
local prime essences, making it hard for them to comprehend the Dao
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
the Sithe could do was bestow some local cultivator techniques to
their Sithe progeny while giving them some advice and guidance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skies were dark and gloomy, with some fiery red light off in the
horizons. A total of three figures were standing within a wilderness
area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
our chance has come!” The leader of the three was a black-robed man
who had a large amount of grass covering his head, and his ‘beard’
was formed from grass as well. His eyes were dark, green, and grim.
“The Exalt has bestowed powerful treasures upon us. If we can kill
that white-robed Doalord, we’ll skyrocket in status and even be
able to control one of the Elder Halls.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother… it is clear from the many gifts the Exalt has offered that
he truly wishes to kill that white-robed Daolord. But why, then,
would he rather give us so many treasures and so many benefits rather
than do it himself? None of those fools in the Sacred Realm wish to
take part either! There’s only one possible answer to this – the
white-robed Daolord is so terrifyingly strong that even Exalts fear
him and are unable to beat him.” An ugly old lady said in a hoarse
voice, “We need to treat this white-robed Daolord as we would an
Exalt, or perhaps someone even more terrifying than an Exalt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Second
sister, you speak sense,” the chubby man by her side said
immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course I know how terrifying he has to be… but in the end, he’s
still failed the Daomerge. We have a chance! Come, let us first go
find that white-robed Daolord,” the black-robed man said with a
growl. “I’ve had enough of life in Purgatory anyhow. I’d rather
die fighting for this opportunity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Both his companions turned solemn as well. Life in Purgatory truly
was a living hell. There was little life here, and it was a dry,
desolate place. The environment was extremely inhospitable, forcing
even Hegemons to tread carefully. Worse, even if you stayed in one
place and didn’t move, some danger would usually descend out of
nowhere. Every day spent here was a day spent in fear. This was a
miserable life indeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued to fly through the realm-seam, inspecting everything
in his path as he flew past the eight realms. Six mortal realms, the
Sacred Realm, and Purgatory – by now, Ning had located all of them.
However, all seven of the other realms were completely locked; only
the gates to Purgatory remained open to him. There was no way to
enter the others at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
they left just one door open to me?” Ning chuckled after a moment.
“It seems the controllers of this hidden dimension have set up a
few traps for me. Fine, fine. I’ll go play with you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning flew over to the Purgatory Realmgate, then gave it a glance.
Ning was rather surprised: “No living beings are around it?”
There was no way his senses could be off; clearly, there really were
no living beings next to the Realmgate at all. What he didn’t
realize was that everyone who had been driven into Purgatory was an
exile; they were all extremely crafty and selfish. No one wished to
be the first to attack, and so they all hid far away, using various
scrying methods to watch the action at the Realmgate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Completely
unmolested, Ning slipped through the Realmgate and arrived at the
vast world of Purgatory behind it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an impressive ‘Purgatory’ this world truly is!” The white-robed
Ning descended upon the dark, foul-looking earth. The world around
him was covered in darkness, with some flames flickering far off in
the distance that were blindingly bright. Around him were many
howling tornados that quickly appeared and then dissipated, while
space and time were rippling behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is quite chaotic here. This ‘Purgatory’ is filled with
countless natural calamities. Even Hegemons would have to tread
carefully here, while Daolords are constantly at risk of imminent
death.” Ning chuckled. “But it’s better than the realm-seam, at
least.” The realm-seam was even more chaotic, to the point where
there was nothing stable there at all. At least this place had an
environment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flames
illuminating the distant horizons… this did make for an eerily
beautiful sight. The destructive tornados that constantly swept
through this place did as well. As for the evil miasmatic aura of
this place that give birth to vilefiends? It was nothing but a bit of
amusement to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this place is rather intriguing. I’m almost finished merging the
Dao of Wind into my Eternal Omega Sword Dao. I might as well train
here for a time.” Although Ning was surrounded by danger, he
remained completely relaxed. He immediately sat down in the lotus
position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning sat down there on the foul ground, his Sword Dao
Domain covering the entire area around him, preventing the various
types of natural dangers from moving close to him. The place where
Ning sat had become sacred grounds, untouched by the filth of
Purgatory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The wind blew past Ning jubilantly, occasionally revealing a few
sparks of sword-light which gathered together, eventually
transforming back into wind once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had reached the Hegemonic level in the Dao of Wind long ago. Now,
what he needed to do was to infuse it into his Sword Dao and create
his Wind Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one day after another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
has that Daolord sat down without even moving an inch?” The exiles
who were scrying this place from afar were all puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to say, that Daolord is pretty powerful. He didn’t have to do
anything; his domain alone was able to block out all the local
dangers. The chaotic environment of Purgatory is absolutely nothing
to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
probably trying to buy time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he wants to drag this out, I’m more than happy to oblige. I’ve
already been trapped here for over eight million chaos cycles. Let’s
see who can last longer! I have plenty of patience.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
let’s wait.” The exiled powers were all waiting for the right
moment to attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
years continued to flow on. In the blink of an eye, over half a
million years had gone by. All of the exiled powers continued to wait
patiently for a good opportunity. Although they all had powerful
Sithe weapons and were confident in their abilities, life in
Purgatory had long ago ensured that they had become slippery and
crafty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
local environment here was bizarre but beautiful in a twisted way,
and the flames flickering off in the distance caused Ning’s face to
flicker with reflected light. Suddenly, Ning’s lips curved upwards
slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes. A smiling look was in his
gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
took a sudden, deep breath, causing the wind streams around him to
begin to howl.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GRAAAAAH!”
Suddenly, Ning seemed to let out an enormous roar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, this was nothing more than a single deep breath, but the
breath was so ferocious that it generated a terrifying howling sound
which shook the earth. It sounded like the bellowing of a thousand
terrifying beasts, and it unleashed countless twisting tornados that
were formed from countless streaks of sword-light. The howling wind
was like the waves of the ocean, crashing out every which way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
howling wind shattered everything in its path like a giant shockwave,
crushing mountains to dust and shattering even the distant flames.
The wind wave spread out with terrifying speed, moving so fast that
even Sith Exalts would be caught offguard by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was Ning’s Wind Sword Dao! The terrifying gust of wind caused even
spacetime to shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Run
away!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
breath was actually aimed at the five Emperors who were located
closest to him. They were hundreds of billions of kilometers away
from him, but it wasn’t enough. The Dao of Wind was a fast Dao to
begin with, and the Wind Sword Dao in the form of a howling tempest
moved with indescribable speed. Hundreds of billions of kilometers
was nothing to it! Although those five Emperors frantically sought to
flee, spacetime was suppressed here. There was no way to warp through
spacetime, and so they could do nothing save just watch as the
terrifying wind howled through the heavens and moved towards them
with incomprehensible speed. There was nowhere for them to hide at
all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhhh!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
all-out against him!” The five Emperors felt a sense of despair.
Some attempted to use Sithe weapons to fight back, but wind by its
very nature is a formless thing. The attacks of the Sithe weapons
flew straight through the wind, completely incapable of affecting the
wind at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
wind swept through the lands like a giant broom, wiping out
everything in its path. Those five Emperors were instantly ground to
dust, with just a few of their top treasures and Sithe weapons
managing to survive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
area of over three trillion kilometers to Ning’s left had been
completely swept clean in a fan-shaped manner. The entire world
seemed to have become incredibly, perfectly flat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other exiles who were watching this from afar were all scared out of
their minds. “He did that with just a shout? H-how powerful is
he?!” The exiles were starting to tremble with fear.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_020__The"></A>
Chapter 20: Broken One By One</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
they didn’t know was that Ji Ning didn’t actually ‘shout’. He
had just mastered his Wind Sword Dao, and had given it a little test
by blowing some air out of his lungs, but the air had quickly moved
at such incredible speeds that all of the exiles were absolutely
stunned and terrified by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
terrifying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was able to slay Hegemons with ease from a distance of hundreds of
billions of kilometers. He truly is unfathomably powerful. All the
Hegemons and Emperors in Purgatory combined might stand a chance, but
if we were to fight separately we would be defeated one-by-one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Join
forces. Our only chance is to join forces.” The exiles were all
extraordinarily talented figures; they instantly knew what they had
to do. But… it was already too late!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I have mastered the Wind Sword Dao, it is time to make my move.
I certainly can’t win a war of attrition against them.” Ning rose
to his feet, taking a single step forwards and warping torwards to
the location where the five slain Hegemons had been at. He waved his
hand, collecting all of the fallen treasures and Sithe weapons. These
were all fine treasures that he could either leave to the Three
Realms or gift to his disciples and friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
Ning took another step forwards and reappeared next to a lake which
was hundreds of billions of kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
Emperors were by the lakeside, carefully scrying the area where Ning
had been just a moment ago. Suddenly, a dimensional ripple appeared
next to them, followed by a white-robed Daolord appearing from it.
His appearance terrified the two Emperors so much that their legs
went soft. “How is this possible? How did he find us? We set up
formations early on to track from very far away if anyone moves close
to us. It didn’t look like the Daolord made any preparations
either. How did he do this?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
couldn’t understand it at all. In truth, this enormous hidden
dimension did put Ning under quite a bit of pressure. Godsense was
blocked out; his only choice was to use his eyes. However, his vision
was also impaired by many types of invisible energy, limiting the
distance at which he could see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
spent half a million years training next to the Realmgate mastering
the Wind Sword Dao, just for this moment,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he remained far away from his enemies and was unable to locate them,
he would end up in a passive situation where he could only endure
attacks from them. This was why he chose to sit down and master his
Wind Sword Dao. Ning had previously spent three thousand chaos cycles
training in various Daos; if he had chosen to focus on the Wind Sword
Dao, he would’ve completed it long ago. However, he had not; he had
let things happen normally, preferring to spend more of his time on
the more-difficult Space Sword Dao. There was no need to focus that
much on a fairly simple Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
Purgatory, he was completely unable to locate any of his foes, and so
he chose to focus on the Wind Sword Dao. The wind was something
without form or shape, but it blew across the entire world. Thanks to
the Wind Sword Dao, Ning was able to ride the wind with his senses
and accurately locate every single one of the Hegemons and Emperors!
He might not be able to see them with the naked eye, but he could
sense them with the wind!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”
The terrified Emperors hurriedly sought to flee, but Ning glared at
them. His gaze seemed to solidify and transform into two streams of
wind. At first, the wind seemed quite gentle, but when it blew past
the two Emperors it transformed into a raging gale. The two Emperors
tried to flee, but the gale was composed of countless tiny streaks of
sword-light that effortlessly ground them into dust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Next.”
Ning didn’t even waste time on picking up their treasures. Instead,
he immediately warped through space towards the next squad of
enemies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning wanted to actually use some of his energy, he could actually use
a Northbow sword to pierce through spacetime and slay them from afar.
However, that took up too much of his power. He wasn’t willing to
resort to this. If he wanted to kill them while conserving his
energy, he had to kill them at close range.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because this hidden dimension had a suppressive effect on his
Sword Dao Domain, preventing it from expanding to its usual size.
When Ning had used his Wind Sword Dao to form a Sword Dao Domain that
used a howling wind to assault his foes, he had only been able to
strike from a distance of a few hundreds of billions of kilometers.
At this distance, Ning was able to use his Wind Sword Dao to suppress
spacetime and prevent his foes from fleeing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
problem was, there were other foes who were trillions of kilometers
away. Some were even more distant! Ning was unable to suppress
spacetime at such a great distance! When his enemies saw him
attacking, they would be able to escape via blinking away. That’s
why he had to get close to them, then attack!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
white-robed Daolord is attacking us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
warping through space to attack us. Hurry up and join forces! If we
stay separated like this, we’re all going to die.” The exiles
were absolutely terrified by now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning appeared before yet another squad. This squad had a total of
three Emperors. When they saw the white-robed Daolord appear, their
hearts were filled with terror. They didn’t hesitate at all,
immediately unleashing their most powerful Sithe weapons to battle
against Ning. They knew that escape was completely impossible; they
had no chance of successfully fleeing at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
of the Emperors each wielded a strange scepter which glowed with a
blurry light that swept out to cover Ning. Not even Ning’s Sword
Dao Domain was able to block this blurry light, as it was formless
and incorporeal. It completely covered Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
third Emperor wielded a longspear. He suddenly threw it forwards,
sending it howling through the air like a stream of light that shot
through the Sword Dao Domain and stabbed at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a powerful illusion! My Dao-heart is perfect and I have reached a
high level of mastery over illusions, but I was still slightly
affected by it. It seems I need to upgrade my Dao of Illusions to
Hegemony as soon as possible. When I ran into that Sithe Exalt
Dauber, I was slightly affected by him as well.” Ning couldn’t
help but sigh. The Sithe truly had reached incomprehensible heights
in every single Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning was slightly affected by the illusions, he remained extremely
clear-minded and his will was resolute. As for the powerful longspear
shooting towards him? Ning simply stood there, not even moving. He
took control over his Sword Dao Domain, transforming countless
streams of sword-light into streams of water and gusts of wind that
blasted at the longspear. Although the spear was able to tear through
the obstruction of the sword-light, its trajectory was slightly
changed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
the distances at which they were fighting, even the tiniest of
adjustments would result in a wide miss. By the time the longspear
flew past Ning, it missed by over thirty meters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
many of them attacked me at the same time with a variety of attacks,
I might be in a bit of trouble. Just three of them? Nothing to fear
at all.” As Ning dealt with the enemy attacks, he launched attacks
of his own as well. He sent a howling wind towards his foes, and by
the time he dodged the longspear his wind had already ground those
three Emperors into dust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
then did Ning reach out to grab the now-ownerless longspear. “Next.”
Ning immediately warped through space, moving towards the next squad.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred Realm. The iridescent Elder Hall. The blue-haired youth and
his two disciples were standing before a giant illusory image which
was currently displaying the scene of Ning slaying the exiles. As the
controller of this entire hidden dimension who was also responsible
for keeping an eye on the outside world, he had the complete ability
to watch over everything which happened within this dimension. Every
action Ning took was witnessed by him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
fools.” The blue-haired youth’s face tightened, and he focused
his gaze on the image as he sent his godsense out of the Elder Hall
and into Purgatory. “Spacetime, freeze!” The blue-haired youth
immediately suppressed spacetime, seeking to block Ning’s advance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Ning warped forwards to kill two different squads in Purgatory, the
Exalt in the Sacred Realm was finally incited to action, suppressing
spacetime in the region around Ning. The exiles, however, did not
suffer from spacetime suppression. Thus, they were able to quickly
warp through space to join together, while Ning was noticeably slowed
down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
haven’t even picked up any treasures yet. The major power behind
this hidden dimension has already chosen to suppress spacetime around
me, eh?” Ning chuckled. “But do you think suppressing spacetime
will be enough to bar my path?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning once more tore a forcible hole through the void before him,
creating a rippling spatial tunnel which sent him hurtling more than
six hundred billion kilometers away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the power of his Space Sword Dao! Compared to the might of his
Space Sword Dao, even the Autarchs who didn’t specialize in the Dao
of Space such as Autarch Titanos or Autarch Ekong were slightly
inferior when it came to tearing through space. The Sithe Exalt was
using the power of the Elder Hall to suppress spacetime around him,
but Ning conserved his energy and used just the power of the Dao
itself to tear through the frozen spacetime and teleport a fairly
short distance!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
teleporting more than six hundred billion kilometers, he was already
outside the region of suppressed spacetime. As a result, he was able
to quickly teleport towards yet another squad, which he dispatched
with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sight truly shocked the Exalt in control of the Sacred Realm. “I
knew that I wouldn’t be able stop him if he went all-out… but he
was actually able to warp through spacetime just by using the power
of his Sword Dao Domain?” The Sithe Exalt was scarcely able to
believe it. “He’s already completely surpassed me in terms of
mastery over the Dao of Space? But his Dao is that of the sword…
how could he have reached such heights in the Dao of Space as well?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t want to believe it, but the display before him was showing
him images of Ning dealing with one squad after another. The various
squads of Emperors began to flee frantically, and slowly some were
beginning to finally join forces together.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_021__The"></A>
Chapter 21: Thirty-Six Stone Pillars</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
what should we do?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we let things continue like this, the Hegemons and Emperors in
Purgatory will be so terrified and ineffective that half of them will
be massacred before they manage to join forces!” The two disciples
next to the Exalt were all rather anxious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blue-haired youth calmed down again. He stared at the images within
the illusory ‘painting’ and said in a cold voice, “You
underestimate the exiles. They might be useless in all other
respects, but one thing they are good at is staying alive. That
white-robed Daolord will at most be able to wipe out 30% of the
Hegemons and Emperors. By then, the rest will have banded together.
I’ve bestowed two precious Apocalypse-class treasures to Purgatory.
I wouldn’t be surprised if the Daolord died there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The two disciples next to him nodded in agreement. Apocalypse-class
treasures were the most powerful treasures the hidden dimension had
at its disposal, aside from Daoguard Towers. Previously, they had
used four triangular Calamity-class treasures against Ning; those
were a bit weaker, but they were also easier to control.
Apocalypse-class treasures were much more complicated to control.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skies were dark. Flames continued to blaze at the ends of Purgatory,
and spacetime remained completely suppressed. Ning tore through
spacetime, repeatedly blinking forwards and slaying the Hegemons and
Emperors at high speed. However, this process took time. The Hegemons
and Emperors who were not destroyed during Ning’s first wave of
assaults were quickly fleeing towards each other and banding
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
fled quite fast.” The white-robed Ning stood at the peak of a tall
mountain. He swept the land with his gaze. Although he wasn’t able
to see the anything, he was able to rely on the wind to determine
that the remaining Hegemons and Emperors had already banded together
into two large squads. They had begun to activate the power of their
Sithe weapons and had set up many traps as they awaited Ning’s
arrival.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
two groups will be a bit hard to deal with.” Ning could sense how
dangerous these two groups would be, and so he chuckled: “Time to
go pick up those treasures first.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning leisurely warped through space, going to the places where he had
previously slain Hegemons and Emperors, then picking up their fallen
Sithe treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that terrifying Daolord up to?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Has
he come yet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
found him!” The exiles all had their own special techniques, and
some were actually able to monitor all of Ning’s actions thanks to
aid from the Sacred Realm. “He’s… actually looting our
treasures?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
exiles were all rather speechless as they watched Ning leisurely
saunter from place to place, picking up all of the treasures. He
hadn’t done so earlier, as the battles had been very fast and he
didn’t want to waste the time. The surviving exiles had all been
focused on running for their lives, and they similarly didn’t stop
to pick up treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nineteen
Sithe treasures, each with their own marvelous properties. All of
them are quite strong, and some are really powerful.” Ning couldn’t
help but grin. The Sithe had naturally prepared many powerful weapons
to use against him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
picking up all the weapons, Ning gracefully warped through space to
arrive before the first squad of Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
two squads are left in all of Purgatory, but each squad has a large
number of Hegemons and Emperors as well as special weapons. They are
actually quite dangerous.” Ning stared towards the desolate
wilderness before him, which held an enormous dark-red castle that
looked almost like some sort of monstrosity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
castle had a total of nine towers, and a total of thirty-six strange
stone pillars were scattered around it within an area of roughly 1.8
billion kilometers. These stone pillars all had different weapons
hovering above them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
over!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
and die!” There were twenty-plus Hegemons and Emperors within the
castle, and they all stared murder towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
castle was an enormous fort that was meant for war. Thirty-six
Emperors were needed to unleash its full power. Although there
weren’t enough Emperors present, many had avatars who could help
out, and so they were still able to make full use of this castle’s
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.
Now how should I deal with this castle…” Ning stared at the
castle from afar, not daring to move too close to it. He could sense
that if he moved within ten billion kilometers of the castle, he
would suffer a terrifying attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wonder what type of attack this castle can unleash. Those thirty-six
stone pillars seem to be quite dangerous as well,” Ning mused. He
currently had no information at all regarding what type of attacks
those castles could unleash; if he wanted to know, he’d have to go
test it out. Once he did, however, he might fall to their fury.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha…
you there! White-robed Daolord! Aren’t you supposed to be a real
badass? Why aren’t you moving?” A loud, mocking, angry shout rang
out from within the castle, spreading out tens of billions of
kilometers and shaking the world beyond it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
thinking, I’m thinking! I’m trying to decide how I should deal
with this castle of yours,” Ning replied with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to scrutinize the castle as he spoke. He could sense that
an invisible field of energy was surrounding the castle up to a
distance of ten billion kilometers. Spacetime was completely
suppressed within this region, and those thirty-six stone pillars
were rippling with power as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can stare at this castle for ten or a hundred chaos cycles, but you
still won’t be able to see the mysteries which my castle contains,”
the angry voice replied. “Just keep watching!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was neither irritated nor impatient by this response. As for the
other squad of Hegemons and Emperors, they watched from afar without
moving towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
Apocalypse-class treasures needed a large number of Hegemons and
Emperors working together to control them. There was no real way for
them to work together; it was better for them to fight against Ning
individually.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
spent over half a month analyzing the castle and ruminating over the
mysterious runes covering the stone pillars. He also carefully
attuned himself to the various auras and ripples emanating from the
castle. Finally, he was able to come to a simple, preliminary
conclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
castle’s attacks should be of the area-attack variety, while the
thirty-six stone pillars will all focus their attacks on me, trying
to make it impossible for me to dodge.” Ning nodded to himself.
“The Sithe have probably come to a rough estimation of my power and
abilities. This castle might actually be a perfect counter for me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was extremely fast, but the Sithe Exalt had specifically chosen this
castle to counter Ning’s speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
so, I really don’t have any other choices. I have to advance and
break through all obstacles.” For Ning to die was one thing, as his
truesoul was already disintegrating. Dying here, however, meant that
the Paragon of Pills wouldn’t be able to escape either. Ning was
unwilling to see this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
to go all out and destroy everything in his path!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning suddenly moved, transforming into a streak of light that shot
towards the distant castle. He soon entered the range of ten billion
kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The Hegemon inside the ugly castle immediately issued the attack
order, and the nine castle towers lit up simultaneously, shooting out
nine semi-translucent beams of light that cut through space. The nine
beams of light shot out at nine of the stone pillars, then turned and
also shot through other stone pillars. The beams of light continued
to pass through the various pillars, quickly forming an enormous
spiderweb of light. As this happened, the weapons above the
thirty-six stone pillars slowly began to build up power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
watched silently as he approached the castle. Six billion kilometers.
Five billion kilometers. Four billion kilometers. Three billion
kilometers…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
as Ning moved within three billion kilometers of the castle, some
sort of mechanism seemed to be activated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hiss!
The top of a stone pillar shot out a ray of deep azure light that
transformed into an enormous azure serpent which was three hundred
thousand meters long. The serpent immediately flew towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crackle!
The top of a second stone pillar manifested a giant eyeball with a
strange vertical pupil. The vertical pupil shot out a streak of
blood-colored light towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
sorts of attacks filled the air, including attacks of bone-chilling
cold, a miasmatic black mist, a vast and evil palm, and layers of
folded spacetime waves. These attacks shot out at Ning from every
direction, clearly seeking to surround and submerge Ning, giving him
no chance to escape as they sought to annihilate him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately understood what a deadly situation he had just stepped
into.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Powerful
Sithe weapons were able to attack at incredible speeds. When he was
attacked by the Daoguard Tower which had trapped the Paragon of
Pills, he had actually been forced to use his own energy to utilize
evasion-arts to dodge! In terms of raw speed, these attacks were
actually even faster than Ning’s own speed. Dodging just one of
them would require energy. Dodging thirty-six attacks of incredible
accuracy and which were all coordinated with each other? How hard
would that be?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for destroying the attacks with raw force? If he tried to do so, his
own speed would be affected and he would suffer one attack after
another. Ning wouldn’t dare to use his own body to resist all these
attacks. He would have to rely on his sword-arts, which meant he
would have to strike out dozens of times. If even the outer perimeter
forced him to strike this many times… this single castle alone
would be enough to exhaust him to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wind!
Lightning!” Ning raised his two arms, pulling out a pair of
Northbow swords from the sheath on his back. He now had a Northbow
sword in each hand, and he sent out two streaks of sword-light at the
same time, employing his Wind Sword Dao and his Lightning Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Ning’s speed suddenly skyrocketed while two streaks of light
appeared behind him. The first streak of light crackled like
lightning, while the second was as ghostly as the wind. They seemed
to form a pair of wings, with one being of lightning and the second
being of wind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had gained certain insights when he had mastered the Wind Sword Dao.
The Five Elements were all able to work together as they were part of
a set, and the Wind Sword Dao and the Lightning Sword Dao were also
able to work together. The wind and the lightning worked in concert,
propelling Ning to the maximum level of speed he was currently
capable of.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_022__The"></A>
Chapter 22: The Storm</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ji Ning moved forwards at a terrifying speed, instantly avoiding two
attacks that swished right past him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
really was like dancing on the edge of a knife. Ning himself had
never been in such an incredibly dangerous situation, and he wasn’t
certain that he would survive it. All he could do was to do his best.
His wings of electric sword-light and wind sword-light had granted
him incredible speed, allowing him to dodge repeatedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! Slash! Suddenly, the semi-translucent rays of light
began to swing over and shoot towards Ning. This caused Ning to
immediately grow a bit nervous. Aside from the attacks from the
thirty-six stone pillars, he also had to deal with the
semi-translucent rays of light. Dodging became even more difficult
for Ning now, and the light in this area had long ago transformed
into an enormous web.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dodge.
Dodge. Dodge.” Under tremendous pressure, Ning continuously dodged
at incredible speeds and moved in extremely unpredictable, bizarre
ways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually dodging?” The Emperors and Hegemons in the castle were all
stupefied by this. As they saw it, these attacks were so ridiculously
fast that none of them would even be able to react in time. Ning,
however, was somehow able to continuously find an empty spot and
avoid the furious attacks, evading and dodging past the attacks. Not
a single one of them managed to hit him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mixing
the Wind Sword Dao and the Lightning Sword Dao together feels
absolutely wonderful.” This was Ning’s first time using two
different Sword Daos together, and as he continued to dodge the
thunder wings and wind wings on his back became increasingly agile
and nimble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was both fast and unpredictable. The two pairs of wings worked
together in an increasingly marvelous way, allowing Ning to become
increasingly faster and nimbler as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wind
can support the lightning’s momentum, while lightning can reinforce
the wind’s strength.” Ning suddenly transformed into two howling
streaks of lightning and wind as his two sets of wings merged
together. Now, there was lightning in the wind and a gale in the
lightning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fast,
savage, dominating, unscrutable, mysterious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! The blurry light of wind and lightning flashed past
the semi-translucent rays of light. It avoided the attacks from the
thirty-six stone pillars with ease as it repeatedly found the
openings in the attacks, and it continued to advance towards the
castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible? How is he able to completely dodge all of our
attacks? This is impossible!” The Hegemons and Emperors in the
castle were growing increasingly nervous. If they were fighting
ordinary cultivators, this castle alone would be more than enough to
stop their opponents in their tracks. However, Ning was comparable to
an Autarch in power! If he managed to get close to their castle, they
would lose! This was because Ning was more than strong enough to use
his sword-arts to pierce through the castle, and he could also blink
straight inside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War, this was exactly what Autarch Bolin and the others had
done; they had blinked straight inside the various warships, with the
external defenses of no use against them whatsoever. Thus, the only
way the castle could be a threat to Ning was by using external
attacks against him. The problem was, they could clearly see that
those attacks were completely incapable of stopping Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
out, go out! All of you, go out! Use every Sithe weapon you have to
assault this Daolord!” the Hegemon in charge commanded. “We have
to stop him and prevent him from getting close to the castle. If he
gets close to us, we’re finished!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone,
head out!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
Hegemons and Emperors on standby must head out immediately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you can disrupt his tempo even slightly, we’ll be able to land an
attack on him. One attack will lead to another, and he might even die
by our hands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
do this!” In truth, the Hegemons and Emperors inside were beginning
to panic as well. Alas, most of them were needed to control the
castle. Even though they had avatars, in the end the castle was only
able to send out a total of three Emperors. These Emperors each had
two or three powerful Sithe weapons. They stood on the surface of the
castle, staring at the distant storm-shaped Ning. Gritting their
teeth, they began to attack and attempt to knock Ning off his rhythm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
A chain flew out towards Ning, seeking to wrap itself around him.
Alas, before it even reached Ning it was struck by a semi-translucent
ray of light and sent tumbling to the ground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
the rays of light could not differentiate between friend and foe. The
castle was using many different types of attacks to assault Ning, and
these attacks were harmonized with each other to a tremendous agree,
ensuring that they wouldn’t cancel each other out. Unfortunately,
it was hard for these three Emperors to fully avoid the
semi-translucent attacks from the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit!”
The three Emperors were being driven mad with rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
their rage was of no use. Ning continued to advance at high speed as
he gained more and more familiarity with mixing his Wind Sword Dao
and Lightning Sword Dao together. None of the attacks were able to
land on him at all. The three Emperors did their absolute utmost to
disturb Ning’s movements, but although an occasional attack managed
to get close to Ning, none of them were able to actually threaten
Ning at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
billion kilometers… nine hundred million kilometers… eight
hundred million kilometers… Ning moved closer and closer to the
castle, and as he did so a full-blown panic began to erupt amongst
the Hegemons and Emperors inside. They all knew that once Ning
reached the tower, they would die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
run!” When Ning reached a distance of two hundred million
kilometers from the tower, the Emperors inside began to break down.
None of them harbored any further hopes of being able to stop Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The entire castle transformed into a streak of light that hurriedly
began to fly away. At the same time, the castle deactivated its
spacetime suppression field as it begin to teleport away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you really think you’ll be able to escape?” As soon as the castle
began to flee, the semi-translucent rays of light all completely
vanished. Now completely unimpeded, Ning instantly appeared in front
of the castle. He reached out with one hand, touching the castle’s
exterior.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Blink.”
Ning used just a tiny amount of Immortal energy to command the Dao to
envelop him, instantly blinking him inside. The tough external shell
of the castle seemed to have transformed into a gentle curtain of
water which Ning easily passed through, arriving inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors inside all revealed looks of despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
A streak of sword-light howled outwards, slaying two of the Emperors
on the spot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Put
down all of your treasures and accept capture. I’m willing to spare
your lives for now,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?
Spare our lives?” The Hegemons and Emperors were all rather
shocked. Ning had pursued them with such ferocity and had instantly
slain two Emperors upon entering the castle. This had truly scared
them out of their minds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. “It seems you would rather die than live, then?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No,
we want to live! Live!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of us want to live!” The Hegemons and Emperors immediately divested
themselves of all their treasures and Sithe weapons, then obediently
lined up in front of Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, pulling them all into his estate-world. He then waved
his hand a second time, pulling the treasures into a different
estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
so-called ‘Sithe progeny’ are still members of our own
Chaosverse. I hope that they aren’t absolutely loyal to the Sithe,”
Ning mused. When Ning had first arrived at Purgatory, his goal was to
weaken the enemy as much as possible; there was naturally no way he
would show mercy. But now that he already gained victory and entered
the castle? Ning wasn’t going to just murder these people unless
necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had been able to immediately recognize two of the Emperors as true
Sithe. They were being ignored and suppressed by the prime essences
of the Chaosverse, which was proof of their identity! The others,
however, were actually ‘Sithe descendants’! They were creatures
of this Chaosverse who had been born and bred here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
put away the entire castle, then collected the thirty-six stone
pillars as well. He was in a superb mood. “I defeated those
Hegemons and Emperors, broke into the castle, and managed to avoid
using too much power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was feeling absolutely wonderful. During this battle, the only thing
he had done was use his wind sword-light and lightning sword-light to
dodge and evade. Evasion-arts consumed much less of his energy than
full-force blows; all that flying which Ning had engaged in was
perhaps at most on par with what would be consumed by a single
sword-blow. Blinking into the castle used up very little energy as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been able to achieve his goals with a minimum amount of effort.
How could he NOT be happy? He began to warp through space, arriving
at somewhere else where the other Hegemons and Emperors were
gathered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning stared forwards, rather puzzled. There were a series of palaces
off in the distance, with the central palace being the largest one.
It was surrounded by a scattering of smaller palaces, and they were
all connected into an enormous palace complex. Ning could vaguely
sense the auras of many Hegemons and Emperors within the palace
complex; there had to be more than twenty of them scattered
throughout that place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have the feeling that this palace complex is even more dangerous than
the castle.” For some inexplicable reason, Ning shivered. He knew
that this was his subconscious warning him of the danger. “Judging
from how the palaces have been laid out, this should be some sort of
enormous formation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but feel a bit of wariness when faced with such a
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no rush.” Ning sat down in the lotus position. “Let me first
spend some time meditating on my Wind Sword Dao and Lightning Sword
Dao.” When he had been flying forwards at high speed earlier, he
suddenly had the feeling that he could merge his Wind Sword Dao and
Lightning Sword Dao on a deeper level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was similar to how Ning was planning to perfectly join his Space
Sword Dao and Time Sword Dao into a Spacetime Sword Dao. Ning now
felt certain that he could also perfectly join his Lightning Sword
Dao and his Wind Sword Dao together into a ‘Storm’ Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
I might find an unexpected surprise from this.” Ning immediately
closed his eyes, allowing his awesome Sword Dao Domain to spread out
around him as he began to meditate.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning remained seated in the lotus position. Gusts of wind howled past
him, occasionally coming together into a mighty storm which was
filled with flickers of lightning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one year after the other. The Emperors and Hegemons in the
palace complex were all beginning to grow rather anxious and
impatient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
hasn’t the Daolord attacked yet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe he’s actually in the mood to train.” The Hegemons
and Emperors were all panicking. The calmer Ning was, the more
panicked they felt. It wasn’t that their Dao-hearts were weak, it
was that Ning’s performance in battle had been absolutely
terrifying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
will our formations be capable of stopping this Daolord? The castle
was also Apocalypse-class, but the Daolord managed to defeat it with
ease. Although these formations seem quite profound and powerful to
us, this Daolord might be able to solve them with ease. If that
happens, we’ll be in serious trouble.” Many Emperors were
worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Relax.
The Exalt himself bestowed it upon us. I imagine he did so for a very
good reason.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
the Exalt bestowed the Apocalypse-class castle as well, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough,
enough. It’s far too late for worrying about things like this.
Either we’ll win or we’ll die in battle. There are no other
options! Besides, as all of you are aware, the castle was something
meant for head-on battles, while we are relying on profound
formations. If he can’t solve the formations, he’ll be trapped
and perish.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t him. Who knows what tricks he might have up his sleeve?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if he DOES manage to solve the formations, it isn’t as though you
have better ones that can be used! Remember, we’re exiles! This
might be extremely dangerous, but it is also our only hope of
survival.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was absolute torture for the Hegemons and Emperors, and the Sithe
Exalt in the Sacred Realm wasn’t feeling much better. Ning,
however, focused all of his efforts on his training. This time, he
meditated for an extremely long period of time. Over half a chaos
cycle went past before he finished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
day, the anxiously waiting Hegemons and Emperors suddenly heard a
loud, rumbling sound appear in the area around the seated white-robed
youth. Lightning howled like wind through the skies, while the wind
itself flickered with crackling electricity. This awesome storm of
lightning and wind possessed incredible momentum and ferocity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Under
the watchful gazes of the nervous Hegemons and Emperors, the
white-robed youth finally opened his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Storm Sword Dao.” Ning nodded in understanding. It had been easier
than he had expected to master his Storm Sword Dao, even easier than
it had been to simply master the individual Wind Sword Dao and
Lightning Sword Dao. “Perhaps they are innately meant to be used
together,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Space and the Dao of Time were naturally meant to be together.
When used simultaneously, they would easily and naturally come
together to form the Dao of Spacetime. This was because time and
space were indelibly linked together like two spokes on a wheel that
fit together perfectly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Lightning, the Dao of Metal, the Dao of Water, the Dao of
Space, and Ning’s Eternal Omega Sword Dao were all completely
irrelevant to each other. There wasn’t really a good way to link
them together, making it extremely difficult to join them together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the Five Elements, the Storm, and Spacetime were all ‘sets’ that
contained highly compatible Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is time.” Ning rose to his feet and stared at the distant palace
complex. The entire palace complex was absolutely teeming with
formations that were both complex and abstruse, but Ning held no fear
of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clink!
He reached out to draw a Northbow sword from the sheath on his back,
then began to walk towards the distant palace complex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
coming!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
headed straight for us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
white-robed Daolord is coming. Quick! Everyone, make your
preparations! When he’s trapped in our formations, we need to
immediately launch all of our attacks against him and hold nothing
back. If we give him enough time to breach our formations, we’ll be
finished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’ll
definitely take him some time to defeat this formation. We need to do
our best to kill him.” The Hegemons and Emperors all stared at the
white-robed Daolord walking towards them, sword in hand. It was as
though they were looking at an absolutely terrifying monster. The
only thing giving them some confidence was the fact that they were
protected by an ancient and powerful Apocalypse-class formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
slowly sauntered forwards, the power of his Sword Dao Domain on full
display as he used it to cover the region before him. It quickly
spread out to cover the entire palace complex, which was hardened
into a single entity. Ning’s Sword Dao Domain alone wouldn’t be
enough to shake it in the slightest. The smaller palaces remained
quietly rooted in place, not releasing any of their power at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
want to see just how powerful they are.” Ning suddenly moved,
transforming into an illusory shadow that shot towards a pathway
which he felt was critical.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
As soon as Ning stepped into the palace complex, the earth began to
shake beneath his feet while the skies began to change. The awesome
might of the complex was fully unleashed, and the scenery in front of
him completely transformed into a field of blurry light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was the only person flying through the region of blurry light.
Whoosh! He instantly accelerated to fly ten billion kilometers
through the light, but found himself still trapped within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.
I feel as though I’m flying in place, as though I haven’t
actually moved at all.” Ning unleashed his Sword Dao Domain,
sending out countless streaks of sword-light but was only able to
extend them to a distance of a million kilometers. Beyond this
distance, there was no way for them to advance any further!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an incredible formation. It actually created its own spacetime
continuum.” Ning began to ponder on his next step. Given his
mastery over the Space Sword Dao, he was able to see some traces of
how spacetime worked here but wasn’t even close to actually being
able to solve it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
place was already a spacetime continuum unto itself, and he was
trapped inside it, unable to leave. “So they plan to simply trap me
here?” Ning shook his head and chuckled. “If the Sithe truly
wished to just trap me, they would’ve kept me locked within the
dimensional realm-seam. There would’ve been no way for me to escape
on my own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
there was no way the Sithe would simply leave him trapped here. If
they wanted to do that, they had plenty of other tools at their
disposal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning turned his gaze to one side. He could sense that spacetime was
changing a bit there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A streak of dense and dark astral light shot out, filled with malice
and wickedness. It was as though endless amounts of sin had been
concentrated in this attack, and it was flying towards Ning at
terrifying speeds. Ning could sense that this dark astral light posed
a threat to him. If he wanted to actually block it, he would have to
use his sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black astral light was simply too fast. Ning’s form suddenly
flickered, emitting a thunderous boom as a wild storm behind him
which almost instantly pushed him out of the trajectory of the dark
astral light aside. The astral light flew past Ning, burying itself
deep into the edge of this spacetime continuum and then completely
disappearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning immediately charged towards the place where the black astral
light had come from, which was also the place he had sensed spacetime
changing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spacetime
was temporarily parted there.” Ning charged towards that area with
his Northbow sword at the ready, but halfway there he came to a halt
because spacetime had gone back to normal. No further fluctuations
could be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
one heartbeat later… riiiiip! Another spacetime ripple appeared
somewhere else, followed by yet another attack. This time, the attack
was an extremely gentle-looking alabaster finger that shot straight
towards Ning, almost instantly appearing right in front of him. Ning
once more used his Storm Sword Dao to evade the attack, moving with
almost ghostly speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn!”
Ning’s face paled slightly. He knew what his opponents were
intending. He was trapped within this tiny spacetime continuum and
unable to escape, while his Sithe opponents were able to use their
many powerful weapons to assault him time and time again at extremely
close range. His only choice was to use his divine power to execute
evasion-arts to dodge these attacks! Thankfully, he had just mastered
the Storm Sword Dao, which specialized in speed and agility. As a
result, he was able to dodge while using just a tiny amount of
energy… but it would still add up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
this continued, his energy supply would continuously deplete while
his truesoul began to crumble apart at an increasingly fast rate.
Each time he used any of his power, the cracks across his truesoul
would widen and his lifespan would grow shorter!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
should I handle this? What’s the best way to break through this
continuum?” Ning was beginning to grow anxious. He scanned the area
around him, but it remained a blur of light. There were no flaws or
openings at all for this spacetime continuum. An opening might appear
when an attack was launched from the outside world, but that opening
would quickly close up and be sealed away. Each time, just a single
attack was launched, and so the opening was extremely small in size.
The Hegemons and Emperors in the outside world could simply wait for
the right moment to attack, giving Ning no chance to flee through the
openings at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
sorts of attacks began to fly at Ning from within this spacetime
continuum, and each time they launched from far away. Ning was forced
to repeatedly use his evasion-arts to dodge. This was the most
conservative use of his energy possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
power continued to deplete. Ning couldn’t help but feel a sense of
urgency as he pondered over the solution for breaking apart this
formation. He never would’ve imagined that Purgatory would be
enough to force him into such dire straits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
like that, Ning was actually in mortal danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!
He has no answer for our formation! He can’t solve it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he can’t solve it, he’s doomed.” The exiles were overjoyed, all
their earlier concerns having vanished like the wind.
Apocalypse-class formations truly were incredible. The white-robed
Daolord was completely unable to overcome this formation, which meant
that killing him would be simplicity itself.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_024__The"></A>
Chapter 24: Struggle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
the very first master of an Eternal Omega Dao their Chaosverse has
given birth to going to die by my hands today?” The blue-haired
Exalt watching the battle from the Sacred Realm felt excited as well.
“Both of the Apocalypse-class treasures I gave those exiles in
Purgatory are aimed squarely at that Daolord’s weaknesses. The
castle had area attacks which that Daolord should’ve been unable to
dodge; by all rights, it should’ve exhausted him to death! Who
would’ve thought that he would possess such incredible speed. Now
that we’ve trapped him within our spacetime formation, I refuse to
believe he’ll be able to break free.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Last
time, Ji Ning had indeed very nearly died within that castle.
Thankfully, the combination of the Wind Sword Dao and the Lightning
Sword Dao had granted Ning a level of speed which surpassed what the
Sithe Exalt had expected, rendering all of those attacks useless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
time, however, Ning wouldn’t be so lucky. He had been trapped
within a separate spacetime continuum, and breaking free would be
extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalt in the Sacred Realm and the Hegemons in Purgatory were
unable to contain their delight at Ning’s impending death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the formation itself, the field of blurry spacetime remained
completely separated from the outside world. Ning was still trapped
within, and his Sword Dao Domain strained against the continuum to no
avail at all. There was nothing he could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Far
away from him, a spacetime ripple suddenly appeared, followed by a
fiery red bird screeching as it shot towards Ning. Even as it
attacked, the distant spacetime hole quickly healed and vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning used his Storm Sword Dao to dodge once more. “I’m going to
die if this continues.” Ning couldn’t find any flaws to exploit
at all, and so all he could do was wave his hand and produce a
precious pagoda in front of himself. This was one of the many Sithe
treasures Ning had acquired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning instantly entered the tower. “I hope it can last for a fairly
long period of time.” For now, Ning’s only option was to rely on
the tower’s defenses to buy him some time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, causing Azurefiend’s avatar to appear next to him.
“Master?” Azurefiend’s avatar looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and take control over this tower, then put your Immortal energy
into it. Focus all your efforts on defending,” Ning barked
mentally. It wasn’t worth it for him to waste his own Immortal
energy on activating Sithe weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Azurefiend’s avatar didn’t hesitate at all. He could sense from
Ning’s grim expression how much danger they were in, and he
immediately poured his Immortal energy into the tower, causing the
many runes and barriers on its surface to light up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
hid inside a tower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
tower won’t be able to dodge effectively. Just destroy it.” The
Hegemons and Emperors were out for blood. They weren’t going to
give Ning any chance to rest at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
A dazzling streak of golden light flew out and appeared in front of
the tower, delivering a vicious blow to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning was able to control the tower and use it to fly around, the
attacks were simply too fast. Ning himself had to rely on using
evasion-arts to dodge. There was no way this type of tower-type
treasure would be able to do the same. Even if it could… he would
still be using up his energy, right? The entire point of Ning hiding
inside the tower was to save as much power as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The surface of the tower erupted after being struck by golden light,
causing a series of ripples to appear. The barrier remained unbroken,
even though it looked a bit damaged. These were attacks that could
threaten even Ning, after all; they were more than powerful enough to
wreck ordinary Sithe artifacts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and bind this treasure as well!” Ning tossed Azurefiend’s
avatar another treasure, one that looked like a star. It seemed
somewhat similar to the Blacksun, but it was a bit weaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
isn’t breaking apart? Hit it simultaneously at two different
places!” The Hegemons and Emperors quickly decided to launch two
simultaneous attacks against it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
these two apocalyptic attacks landed, the barrier covering the tower
was finally unable to endure any longer. The runes of the barrier
collapsed, followed by the surface of the tower exploding into
countless shards that blasted everywhere. Even the insides of the
tower began to collapse and fall towards Ning, but before actually
managing to hit him they would all be pushed to one side by his Sword
Dao Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lifted his head, staring at the many cracks that had appeared to his
left. “Release that star,” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master!” Azurefiend knew that this tower wouldn’t be able to hold
on for much longer, and so he immediately waved his hand, producing a
jade-green star that the two of them instantly entered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Soon, the Sithe attacks completely destroyed the tower, causing it to
explode and revealing the undamaged jade-green star inside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has more treasures? Keep attacking!” The Hegemons and Emperors
continued to fight fiercely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
three attacks, the star was destroyed… revealing a realmship! The
realmship was even weaker; it was completely destroyed after just two
two attacks. Azurefiend couldn’t help but feel aggrieved at how
fast these priceless treasures were being used up, but Ning simply
frowned. There wasn’t enough time; treasures on this level simply
couldn’t hold on for long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
other options.” Ning had Azurefiend’s avatar activate and take
control over that Apocalypse-class castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the most powerful Sithe treasure Ning had acquired to date! It
was more powerful than the Blacksun, the Tigerhill, and even the
castle which was protecting the Three Realms! Ning had been planning
to give it to the Three Realms once he left this place, but he was
out of options. His other treasures were too weak; they weren’t
able to withstand more than just a few attacks. This meant he
wouldn’t have any time to analyze the flaws of this place… and
once he died, all his treasures would be lost. Even the Paragon of
Pills would die here. Now wasn’t the time to hold back!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A strange, monstrous-looking dark-red castle appeared. Ning and
Azurefiend’s avatars were located securely within the castle, while
Azurefiend was burning up his Immortal energy at a rapid pace to
maintain the castle’s most basic defenses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
an Apocalypse-class castle!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait,
that’s the castle from earlier.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!
Attack! Break through it!” The Hegemons and Emperors continued to
attack furiously, raining down blows upon the castle. However, the
barriers and runes flowing over the surface of the castle were
completely undamaged! An Autarch-level attack would have a chance at
breaking through the castle’s defenses, but these Sithe weapons
weren’t quite at this level; at most, these attacks were comparable
to the Blazesun Ruler’s attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only reason these attacks were dangerous to Ning was because of how
brittle his body was. He was extremely powerful, but attacks from the
likes of the Blazesun Ruler would still consume some of his energy.
Apocalypse-class castles, however, were extremely stable; they could
easily endure the blows head-on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”
Ning let out a sigh of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
if you had such a powerful treasure, why didn’t you take it out
right away? We lost so many valuable treasures, including a
realmship!” Azurefiend couldn’t help but feel some pain at the
thought of all that lost wealth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
don’t matter.” Ning didn’t explain, as he was still under
tremendous pressure. He knew that hiding inside the Apocalypse-class
castle would merely buy them a bit of extra time. There was no way
the Sithe would just give up like that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, causing the Paragon of Pills, Lord Annihilation,
Hegemon Tia, and Hegemon Flameleft to appear. The four of them
instantly sensed how grim the atmosphere seemed to be, and the
Paragon of Pills looked towards Ning in a rather puzzled way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately explained, “Please take turns in launching area attacks
with the castle.” The castle technically had thirty-six stone
pillars as well, but Ning didn’t have the time to slowly lay down
all of the stone pillars into formation. Moreover, this
Apocalypse-class castle’s most powerful attacks were actually those
rays of semi-translucent light! However, those incredibly powerful
attacks consumed a similarly incredible amount of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend’s
avatar was enough to maintain their defenses, but what about their
attacks? Ning was forced to ask the Paragon of Pills and the others
to help out. This castle needed a total of thirty-six Emperors to
fully activate it, but it could also be used with a lower number.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
you need to do is make sure you focus your attacks in the same
direction,” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go first.” Lord Annihilation instantly began to pour an enormous
amount of Immortal energy into the castle. On top of his natural
energy regeneration, he also began to make use of the many Immortal
pills he carried with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine towers of the ugly, dark-red castle all lit up. Nine
semi-translucent rays of light began to shoot out, tearing through
the surrounding space even though they were unable to tear through
local spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
The nine towers shot out rays of light everywhere, causing the
spacetime membrane of this dimension to ripple slightly. Alas, the
membrane remained stable and unharmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
rays of light are more powerful than the attacks most Sithe weapons
can unleash,” Ning mused. “The problem is that as a type of area
attack, the power is diffracted. There’s no way to use them to
breach this dimensional space.” This spacetime continuum was
extremely stable. Ning had an Autarch’s power, but he had the
feeling that there was no chance he could break through via raw
power! If all nine rays of light managed to concentrate their power
on a single location, they might just barely come close to the
necessary power level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Continue,”
Ning instructed. The ugly, dark-red castle once more began to launch
those repeated attacks. As for Ning, he carefully watched as those
distant holes appeared in spacetime with each enemy attack. He was
trying to understand the mysteries inherent to this place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t break through! The castle is too powerful. We aren’t able
to breach it at all.” The exiles were starting to grow anxious.</P>

Chapter 25: Remaining Lifespan</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
attacks were completely ineffective against this castle, and each
time they attacked they had to temporarily create an opening in the
membrane surrounding this field of spacetime. The fluctuations
generated by these brief openings was enough to let Ji Ning analyze
the composition of the formations. Alas, the fluctuations disappeared
so very quickly that he couldn’t actually go close and take a look
in person. His only option was to scry them and their secrets from
afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
The Sithe Exalt was watching everything from the Sacred Realm, and he
was so angry that his teeth hurt. He never would’ve imagined that
the castle he bestowed upon the first group would prove to be so
troublesome now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has to die!” The Sithe Exalt knew that they wouldn’t necessarily
have another chance like this. He instantly sent down eight more
attack-oriented treasures which were strong counters for this castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
is a diagram of the barriers surrounding the surface of the castle.
There are a total of twenty-one critical points in total. If you
attack eight of them at the same time, you’ll have a chance to
destroy it,” the Sithe Exalt ordered. The reason why he handed out
eight was because he only HAD eight of these dark corrosive
treasures. These were the only treasures which were strong counters
against this particular castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
exiles began to launch another wave of attacks, while Azurefiend, the
Paragon of Pills, Lord Annihilation, Hegemon Tia, and Hegemon
Flameleft used all of their power to fight back!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Suddenly, a series of illusory black longspears shot
into the area, slamming against the castle. This time, the barriers
of the castle began to tremble and break apart, but thankfully the
castle itself was so incredibly thick and sturdy that the attack only
blasted out a small crater on its surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s face tightened slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
the barriers were breached!” Azurefiend’s avatar said rather
nervously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is fine,” Ning said calmly. “The Sithe created this castle. They
know the weaknesses of the barriers, which is why they were able to
breach them with ease. However, the castle’s outer layer remains
incredibly thick. It won’t be easy for them to pierce through it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
strongest defensive strength of this castle lay in the materials it
was made from. The Tigerhill, for example, was sheathed in a thick
layer of deepfire blackstone! Breaking through via raw power would
naturally be extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for this castle? It was even more powerful than the Tigerhill. Its
surface was created from a strange, dark-red metal that seemed to be
alive. Ning didn’t really know how to describe it, but what he did
know was that it was harder to damage than even deepfire blackstone!
Those longspears had been filled with a strange type of corrosive
energy, which was why they had managed to erode a small crater onto
the surface of the castle. If it wasn’t for that, the castle
probably wouldn’t have even been marked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
One longspear after another flew towards the castle, breaking through
its barriers repeatedly and gouging out more and more craters on its
surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
cast a sidelong glance at the black mist which clung to those
craters. The corrosive black energy was continuing to slowly melt
through the surface of the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
offensive weapons are applying the Dao of Darkness to a truly
incredible degree.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh at this. The
Sithe truly had reached the apex in virtually every single Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning didn’t really care. His attention was primarily focused on
analyzing the ripples in spacetime which appeared with each attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. The Hegemons and Emperors attacked nonstop,
using up a large amount of Immortal energy. Thankfully, they had
prepared a large amount of spirit-pills to replenish their power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
attacked nonstop for nearly an entire hour. By now, the entire castle
was covered with a layer of incredibly dense and corrosive black
mist. Everyone inside the castle looked quite nervous, because they
all knew that this powerful castle was at the verge of collapse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
we can’t hold on much longer. What should we do?” The Paragon of
Pills felt both anxious and guilty. She blamed herself for this,
because Ning had only fallen into this Sithe trap due to having come
here to rescue her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
do you have any ideas?” Azurefiend’s avatar was worried about
Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“At
least it bought me an hour,” Ning said. “Don’t worry about the
rest.” As he spoke, he waved his hand and drew away the Paragon of
Pills and the others. As they disappeared, a look of worry was
visible in their eyes. Some were worried about Ning, while others
were only worried about themselves! Once Ning died, all of them would
die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
be precise… the Paragon, Azurefiend, Flameleft, and Tia were not
afraid of death. They were worried for Ning. Lord Annihilation,
however, very much wanted to stay alive!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing
for it. Life and death shall be determined by this!” Ning suddenly
cracked a smile. Both his true body and his Primaltwin had spent this
period of time analyzing the mysteries of this dimension, seeking a
way to destroy it. His Primaltwin had even made use of 100x temporal
acceleration! Alas, this sort of spacetime formation would not be
easy to deconstruct; even if Ning had 10,000x more time, it still
probably wouldn’t be enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
broke through!” The Hegemons and Emperors outside were excited at
their successes. BOOM! The dark-red castle’s outer shell was
finally corroded through by that dark mist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
A dazzling streak of sword-light suddenly lit up. In the middle of
that sword-light was a white-robed figure whose eyes radiated a
towering desire to do battle. Ning had discarded all other thoughts
save for one – stay alive! He had to make it out of this place
alive! Only if he made it out would the Paragon of Pills and the
others survive as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break! BREAK!” Ning manifested three heads and six arms,
simultaneously wielding all six Northbow swords for the first time
since his Daomerge. He seemed to have gone completely berserk, and
every single attack he used was that of the Space Sword Dao. The
destructive yet ephemeral sword-light began to skyrocket in power as
all six swords stabbed out at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
attacked using maximum power with each sword, and his swords were the
Northbow Swords, the preeminent offensive swords in all the
Chaosverse. Every single strike he unleashed had power comparable to
those of the most powerful of Autarchs! It must be remembered that
although Ning had fought for quite some time, he generally didn’t
strike with full-force on his attacks, while very little energy was
used up when he merely used evasion-arts. The amount of energy
consumed when he went all-out was quite shocking!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sword-light
flashed again and again and again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Finally, a hole appeared in one corner of this dimension, revealing
the dark world outside. Swoosh! Ning immediately charged outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning charged outside the formation, he instantly appeared in
front of a palace within the palace complex. He blinked inside the
palace, slaughtering all of the true Sithe within it! As for the
Sithe progeny, he confiscated all of their treasures and then locked
them up for later testing. If they were truly loyal to the Sithe,
they would be put to death in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”
Ning’s face was rather ashen after he finished mopping up everyone
in the palace complex. “Now that sucked. I only have six hundred
chaos cycles left,” Ning said with a self-mocking chuckle. He had
been forced to use too much power, using maximum-force blows each
time as he rained a total of eighteen consecutive blows upon the
formation in order to escape it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
this was after Ning had spent a full hour analyzing the dimension,
discovering some of its critical points. Although he wasn’t even
close to being able to solve it, by focusing his attacks on those
critical points he was able to make his attacks ten times more
effective than they otherwise would be. This was why he had chosen to
take the risk of launching eighteen full-strength attacks with his
Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
Autarch who was trapped in a similar situation would’ve been able
to escape much more easily. He could’ve simply launched nonstop
attacks! An Autarch would not run out of energy, and so after ten
thousand attacks the formation would be unable to withstand it any
longer and collapse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Six
hundred chaos cycles,” Ning mused to himself. Based on his original
estimates, he would probably die after another hundred full-force
strikes… and based on his actual energy usage, the ten-plus
full-strength blows he had launched had resulted in his lifespan
being reduced from ten thousand chaos cycles down to six hundred!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because a Daolord’s crumbling truesoul was like a cracking dam!
The more he attacked, the greater the cracks would become. When he
first started to fight, the crack would double in size and the
truesoul crumbling speed would double. As a result, his lifespan
would shorten by half, from around 12,000 chaos cycles to just 6000
chaos cycles!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
he continued to attack, his lifespan would drop by yet another half.
The second time, it would ‘merely’ drop from 6000 chaos cycles to
3000 chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
that, 1500 chaos cycles. After that, 750…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
only took four or five ‘rounds’ of attacks for his lifespan to
drop from 12,000 chaos cycles to 600 chaos cycles, and it would
continue to drop from there on. After another ten or so rounds, his
lifespan would be reduced to just half a chaos cycle. Technically,
however, those ten rounds would ‘only’ have consumed around 599
chaos cycles, whereas the first few rounds consumed over 10,000 chaos
cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
the more he fought the smaller the absolute value of the effect on
his lifespan would be. Alas, once his truesoul crumbled to a certain
degree it would completely fall apart! Much like a dam which was
riddled with cracks would eventually collapse, Ning would die after
roughly a hundred full-force strikes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Six
hundred chaos cycles… it’ll be enough!” Ning revealed a smile.
“At least I’m still alive. It was all thanks to that extra hour
that I managed to survive and escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
truesoul was now crumbling at a far, far faster rate than it had been
in the past. Ning raised his head to stare towards the skies. “Next
will be the Sacred Realm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aside
from Ning, Purgatory no longer held any other living beings at all.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_41_Chapter_026__The"></A>
Chapter 26: No Choice</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ji Ning very much wanted to bring the Paragon of Pills out alive, he
knew that there was a high chance that he would die on this trip to
the Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Before
going there, I need to first take a look at the cultivation methods
these Sithe descendants used.” Ning had always been curious as to
how the Sithe had trained their progeny! Their descendants were born
and bred within Ning’s Chaosverse, making it impossible for them to
train in true Sithe techniques. How, then, did the Sithe teach them?
Did they just hand over normal cultivator techniques, or did they use
other retrofitted techniques?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning willed his Sword Dao Domain to expand outwards, preventing
anyone from scrying him. At the same time, he caused a dazed-looking
blood-robed Emperor to appear next to him. This was one of the
several Emperors and Hegemons Ning had captured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
Daolord,” the blood-robed Emperor said hurriedly with respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
I’m going to ask you a few questions. Be a good boy and answer them
for me,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead, Daolord. I’ll tell you everything I can,” the blood-robed
Emperor replied obediently. Moments later, his gaze turned rather
muddled as an illusion took hold of him. He didn’t even try to
resist it, and even if he did Ning had reached a far higher level in
the Dao of Illusions. The tiny strand of sword-intent which Ning had
sent into his consciousness was enough to completely suppress his
mind, ensuring that the following illusions worked without fail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how ordinary mortals might find themselves going
totally blank when they saw something that left them absolutely
awestruck. They would briefly lose all capability of rational
thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
who didn’t specialize in the Dao of Illusions were still able to
take advantage of their overall overwhelming superiority to ensure
that Hegemons would be unable to resist them. Trapping Hegemons
within illusions was extremely simple… but of course, the stronger
one’s Dao-heart was, the less effective this mind-suppressive
technique would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe truly are vicious.” Ning continued to flip through this
Emperor’s memories. “They actually have forced all of their
descendants to swear lifeblood oaths to obey all orders the Exalt
gives them. That way, it’ll be extremely difficult for the
descendants to break free from the Sithe, even if they wanted to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh.
They actually train in the exact same types of techniques that we
cultivators use.” Ning shook his head. “Even the teaching methods
are the same.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
flipped through some of the memories he cared about the most, but
didn’t find any pleasant surprises. Ning then began to review the
many memories of the life which this Emperor had lived. This Emperor
had been alive for so long and had so many memories that even Ning
would need quite a bit of time to process them all. Ning primarily
kept his focus on finding hints which would give him a better chance
to develop a perfect cultivation path like the one the Sithe used. He
wanted to find something that could let him continue to live.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he could live, why should he seek death? Hope was reserved for the
living alone, and so Ning had never given up hope.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
spent a total of three days flipping through this Emperor’s
memories at high speed. Suddenly, a look of delighted shock appeared
on Ning’s face. “So this is…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Long,
long ago, the Sithe had transmitted certain special cultivation
techniques for their progeny to try out! However, many Sithe
descendants encountered problems during the testing process. Some
self-detonated and died, while others saw their truesouls destroyed.
The Sithe tested out a total of nine different types of techniques,
but all of them ended up in failure. Even though the ninth and final
technique allowed one to become a Daolord of the First Step, upon
actually becoming a Samsara Daolord the cultivator’s body would
crumble and their truesoul would shatter apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
that day forth, the Sithe gave up their research into those nine
unique techniques and started to pass down cultivator techniques to
their children instead. Much like Ning, they trained in divine power
and Immortal energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nine
unique techniques?” A look of delight was on Ning’s face. “The
ninth one in particular… it actually allows divine power, Immortal
energy, and all other types of energy to join together, strengthening
both body and soul. Only, it would fail once the practitioner
actually became a Samsara Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
the most supreme of Sithe could’ve created something like this. I
wager it came from their Lord of Chaos, who repeatedly attempted to
create a perfect cultivation technique suited for our Chaosverse.”
Ning felt rather excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nine
techniques in total, with each cultivator swearing an oath not to
pass it down to anyone else? I have to find them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a sense of excitement and desire for these techniques. The Sithe
had failed in their nine special techniques, because they couldn’t
truly and directly connect to the Dao of this Chaosverse. Ning,
however, could! He might not be at the same level as the Lord of
Chaos, but if he acquired those nine Sithe techniques… maybe, just
maybe, there would be a chance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
knew that the chance was extremely low, but he still wanted to give
it a shot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors who Ning had captured had all been alive for an
extremely long period of time. They all knew of the nine secret
techniques, but they had all painstakingly followed the normal route
to becoming Emperors. Most of them hadn’t even been taught those
special techniques! Three of them did know the techniques, but they
had sworn oaths not to transmit them; if they attempted to do so,
their truesouls would shatter and they would die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
the hidden dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ning was alongside the avatars of Autarch Titanos and
Autarch Mogg. They had been searching for many years for a way to
break into the hidden dimension. During this period of time, all the
other Autarchs had also come over to give it a try, but none of them
were able to lock onto the exact location of that hidden dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos. Autarch Mogg.” Ning asked hurriedly, “Autarchs, have you
heard of nine special techniques which the Sithe once bestowed upon
their progeny?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
know of this, yes.” Autarch Titanos nodded slowly. “During the
Dawn War, we actually fought against a number of Sithe descendants
during our war against the Sithe. All of them were completely loyal
to the Sithe and they fought like rabid dogs. Most of us were filled
with bloodlust at the time and showed them no mercy at all. The only
one who actually held back and captured a few of them was Autarch
Skyfeeder. When she reviewed their memories, she came to learn that
the Sithe had once transmitted nine special techniques to them, but
all of those techniques were failures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Autarch Mogg nodded. “Most likely, the Sithe wanted to
mass-produce a large number of Hegemons or perhaps even Autarchs!
They could have their descendants swear lifeblood oaths to never
rebel against them, after all. If they succeeded, they would be able
to draw power from our Chaosverse… at which point, they could
murder those descendants and steal their power, weakening our
Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
they failed. As for those nine techniques, we wanted to find them to
see if there was anything which might inspire us,” Autarch Titanos
said, “But after the Dawn War concluded, we were unable to find any
traces of Sithe descendants, and so we had nowhere to start.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
about the ones Autarch Skyfeeder captured?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of them swore lifeblood oaths to never transmit those techniques.
When we tried to forcibly rip the techniques out of their memories,
their truesouls crumbled apart.” Autarch Titanos shook his head.
“Given that we were unable to find any more Sithe progeny after
this, we let the matter rest.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quickly understood. Sithe progeny were quite rare, and it was also
fairly hard to recognize them at a glance. They looked just like
ordinary cultivators, after all! The Autarchs couldn’t just spend
their time wandering the cosmos and flipping through the memories of
cultivators at random, right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe descendants.” Ning knew that many of the weaker Sithe
descendants in the hidden dimension had never even heard of those
nine techniques, much less studied them! The only ones who might
truly know those techniques were the high-status Sithe who had been
along for a long period of time. Those were generally at the Emperor
level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to spend some time searching this hidden dimension and do my
best to find those nine techniques,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred Realm. The Elder Hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blue-haired Exalt remained seated upon his throne, with a large
number of Emperors and Hegemons gathered before him. Some of them
were true Sithe, while some had been raised and trained over the
course of countless years within this enormous hidden region. The
Sithe had put quite a bit of effort into rearing these descendants,
and their success rates were significantly higher than what the
native cultivators were used to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ever
since the Dawn War ended… I, Exalt Bowenya, have been stationed in
this dimension. I have been here for a very, very long time.” The
blue-haired Exalt stared downwards, then continued slowly, “I feel
a sense of deep attachment to this dimension, and I truly do not wish
for trouble to occur here. In fact, I don’t even wish for a second
war to begin against the cultivators.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
that isn’t a choice I can make! Nor is that a choice any of you can
make!” The blue-haired youth stared downwards at them. “A
terrifying Daolord has arisen amongst the cultivators, and we have
only one choice available to us… kill him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can kill him, even sacrificing this entire dimension would be
worth it.” The blue-haired youth let out a sigh. “I know that
this place is home for many of you Hegemons… and I view it as home
as well. I’ve spent the majority of my long life here. Life here
has been peaceful and gentle. I don’t want to give it up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
once this Daolord came here, our peaceful life came to an end.” The
