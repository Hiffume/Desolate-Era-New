Chapter 1 - Jadesea
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The temperament of the
black-robed maiden, Yu Wei, was something Ji Ning couldn’t quite
get a grasp on. However, when he thought about how many times the
white-haired elder had accepted the black-white pellets and liquefied
elemental essence on his behalf, Ning felt absolutely delighted. In
addition, this series of Dao Debates had also served as a form of
baptism. He could sense that he had evolved, somehow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning!” A voice rang out in celebration. Ning
turned to look, only to see the skinny, small, white-robed Mu
Northson charging over with incomparable excitement. He hurriedly
howled, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you are way too
powerful. You consecutively defeated so many Wanxiang Adepts, and
even that seemingly powerful Northmont Blackcurrent was defeated by
you. Just now, I asked senior apprentice-sister Winterain; that
senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei who defeated you is a reincarnated
Immortal, and one who has trained for ten years more than we have,
and entered the school long before us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, I’m
not upset,” Ning laughed. Northson was still incomparably excited.
“In short, you are way too powerful. I heard senior
apprentice-sister Winterain say that it is extremely rare to see
someone like you, and that even in the Black-White College, you can
be considered a supreme genius. Perhaps, in a few thousand years or a
few tens of thousands of years, the entire Black-White College will
have firmly memorized your name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“You praise me over-much.” Suddenly…he heard voices ring out
from the side. “Uncle-Master Headmaster.” “Uncle-Master
Headmaster.” A chorus of voices called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of Primal
Daoists, who had arrived soundlessly and without announcement and who
had been hiding themselves, all walked over at this point in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you can go
back now.” Daoist Jadesea, who was walking at the head of the
group, said calmly, “Ji Ning, stay behind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Quite a few
members of the third generation still wanted to converse with Ning,
and at least ensure that Ning knew their names. This was because
everyone understood something: Given how powerful he had shown
himself to be, so shortly after entering the school…so long as he
didn’t die, he would definitely be a truly influential figure of
Stillwater Commandery. However, since the headmaster had given the
order, they all naturally departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire gave Ning a deep look, memorizing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Intriguing,
intriguing. More and more intriguing.” The fat, sloppy-looking
youth had a look of delight on his face. He lazily ambled away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said to the nearby
Northson, “Junior apprentice-brother Northson, you go back as
well.” Northson nodded. “Alright.” He immediately departed
alongside Winterain. Soon, no one was left in the entire Dao Debate
Palace aside from the Primal Daoists and Ji Ning, as well as the
Immortals who had hidden themselves in the corner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Daoist
Jadesea looked at Ning, and the Primal Daoists next to him looked at
Ning as well, their eyes filled with curiosity. “Uncle-Master
Headmaster,” Ning acknowledged respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know what a
Sword Immortal is?” Daoist Jadesea asked. Ning replied, startled,
“Sword Immortals? Some Immortals who use flying swords in extremely
powerful ways are addressed respectfully by others in this manner, I
believe. Can it be that this term has a special meaning?” Even up
till now, Ning still wasn’t quite sure as to what the term ‘Sword
Immortal’ truly meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-Master Diancai
didn’t tell you?” Daoist Jadesea seemed to have thought of
something as he spoke. Ning replied, “Master didn’t discuss Sword
Immortals with me in detail. He only provided me with guidance
regarding sword arts. He told me to finish mastering the
[Neo-Tripartite Lotus Sword] and the first stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword], then to seek him out again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jadesea nodded.
“That explains it, then. If one is capable of executing the first
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], then one has already become a Sword
Immortal. You should know that this world is filled with many Daos,
yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I do.” Ning
nodded. In his heart, he added…that he also knew that the most
supreme figure of the Three Realms, Maiden Nuwa, had comprehended
eighty four thousand different Daos! But of course, this was
according to what he had heard in the past from the Lord of Cui
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daos are
numerous beyond counting.” Daoist Jadesea looked at Ning. “In
addition, there are different levels of Dao as well.” Ning’s ears
twitched. “Different levels of Dao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daoist
Jadesea nodded. “The Dao is divided into the supreme ‘Heavenly
Daos’, the extremely exalted ‘Grand Daos’, and the ordinary
‘Daos’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly Daos,
the Grand Daos, and Dao?” Ning held his breath. Not even his master
had discussed these things with him in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly Daos
are the most fundamental of Daos, and they are the underpinning of
the functioning of the cosmos. They are incomparably supreme. For
example, the Five Elements! After Pangu established the universe, the
universe was formed from the most basic of particles, the Five
Elements. Normally, when we talk about ‘swearing an oath by the Dao
of the Heavens’, or making a ‘Oath of Blood to the Dao of the
Heavens’, we are swearing an oath to the Heavenly Daos. The
Heavenly Daos uphold the functioning of the universe, and once we
violate an oath sworn to them, they will naturally punish us. No one
can escape the punishment of the Daos of the Heavens. This is the
most supreme of Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked and
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends, so long as one can comprehend a Heavenly Dao, then one will
become one of the most incomparably exalted figures of the Three
Realms.” Daoist Jadesea’s eyes were filled with a boundless
eagerness as well, and the gazes of the Primal Daoists next to him
became lost and dreamy as well. To them, the Heavenly Daos were
legends and myths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, I’ve
never even heard of anyone who comprehended a Heavenly Dao.” Daoist
Jadesea laughed as he looked at Ning. “Never, not even in any of
the legends or stories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed to himself.
Right. Heavenly Daos. When Immortal practitioners swore an oath, they
would do so towards the Dao of the Heavens. It was the Daos of the
Heavens which upheld the functioning of the entire Three Realms. It
was naturally incomparably exalted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One level lower than
the Heavenly Daos are the Grand Daos!” Daoist Jadesea looked
towards Ji Ning. “Every single Grand Dao is also extremely exalted,
and it is extremely difficult to even gain an initial insight into
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On a level lower
than the Grand Daos are the most numerous, ordinary Daos.” Daoist
Jadesea looked at Ji Ning. “Your Dao of Rainwater, and the Daos of
Freezing Ice, Mystic Ice, and the like…these are all ordinary
Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He now
understood that Daos were divided into levels as well! Heavenly Daos
were the most supreme, the fundamental Daos which underpinned the
cosmos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Sword, however, is one of the Grand Daos!” Daoist Jadesea looked
towards Ning. “Everyone who has embarked upon the Dao of the Sword
is known as a Sword Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning stared.
The Dao of the Sword was one of the Grand Daos? He had actually
embarked onto the path of a Grand Dao?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To gain an initial
insight into the Dao of the Sword, one must clearly develop and
comprehend one’s sword-heart and make it lustrous.” Daoist
Jadesea looked towards Ji Ning. “This is also the first stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword]. You need to have a heart which is supremely,
sincerely devoted to the sword, and you need to make that sword-heart
of yours lustrous…the difficulty of doing this is even greater than
reaching the Dao Domain level of your Dao of Rainwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
acknowledgement. It was, indeed, a bit harder to reach the ‘Lustrous
Sword-Heart’ level than to develop his Rainwater Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
difference in Daos. It is even harder to gain an initial insight into
a Grand Dao than it is to reach the Dao Domain level in an ordinary
Dao.” Daoist Jadesea stared at Ning, his gaze blazing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is also why you
were able to defeat even Northmont Blackcurrent, who has reached the
level of possessing five Dao Domains. It is because the Dao you
comprehended is a Grand Dao! Although he has comprehended many, they
are all lesser Daos! In addition…the Dao of the Sword, even amongst
the Grand Daos, is known as the Grand Dao with the greatest offensive
combat potential. Sword Immortals are legendary for their combat
power as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In our Black-White
College…including you, we only have a total of two Sword
Immortals,” Daoist Jadesea said. “One is you, with the other
being your master, Uncle-Master Diancai.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because you have
gained an insight into the Grand Dao of the Sword, our Black-White
College shall bestow upon you two thousand black-white pellets.”
Daoist Jadesea took out a jade bottle, handing it over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
overjoyed. Two thousand black-white pellets? When his master had
bestowed him with black-white pellets, he had informed Ning that he
would receive a thousand black-white pellets for reaching the Dao
Domain level, and just two thousand black-white pellets for his soul
reaching the ‘divine sense’ level. Generally speaking, only
Primal Daoists would have a soul at the ‘divine sense’ level. And
yet, just gaining an initial insight into a Grand Dao merited a
similar award of two thousand black-white pellets!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there no
records of this within the black-and-white book?” Ning hurriedly
asked. “The black-and-white book has quite a few records regarding
various rewards of black-white pellets, such as for joining the
Raindragon Guard, becoming a two-clawed Raindragon Guard, a
three-clawed Raindragon Guard…why aren’t there any records
regarding becoming a Sword Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenly Daos. Grand
Daos. Ordinary Daos. The fact that there are these differences is not
something which is to be carelessly exposed.” Daoist Jadesea looked
towards Ning. “If you hadn’t comprehended them for yourself and
we told you of them, it would actually harm you by affecting your
Dao-heart. You would be unwilling to go comprehend an ordinary Dao,
and would focus on trying to master a Grand Dao. But do you think a
Grand Dao is so easily comprehended? If you aren’t already at that
level, letting you know about the levels will harm you for no
benefit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even us.” Daoist
Jadesea looked at the crowd of Primal Daoists. “Even we only
learned about this matter after we finished comprehending a complete
Dao Path. Now that we have mastered a complete Dao Path, the next
step for us is to comprehend a Grand Dao!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Daos are
extremely hard to understand. Even in our Black-White College, and
even for the likes of senior Northwalker, there has never been anyone
who has completely and thoroughly mastered a Grand Dao.” Daoist
Jadesea looked towards Ning. “The path of mastering a Grand Dao is
incomparably more difficult than the path of mastering an ordinary
Dao; thousands of times more difficult. However, the power of a Grand
Dao is also countless times greater. You must diligently train and
not slacken off in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
with solemnity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. With
regards to Sword Immortals…if you have any questions, go ask your
master. In the entire Black-White College, only your master is
capable of truly teaching you.” Daoist Jadesea laughed, then turned
and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, it is quite
rare for me to officiate over a recruitment ceremony, and yet when I
did, I ended up taking you in, hahaha.” Daoist Wu Xiu and the
others all chatted for a bit with Ning as well. Every single one of
them spoke with Ning for a bit. Clearly, as they saw it…in a few
decades, or perhaps in a century, Ning would be on a completely equal
level to them. Shortly afterwards, the Primal Daoists all departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning let
out a sigh of relief. “Heavenly Daos? Grand Daos? Daos?” Ning
suddenly thought of something. “The creator of the underwater
estate even had many Immortal-ranked magic treasures and Pure Yang
magic treasures. I also heard that he was a Fiendgod who was born
during the era of primal chaos, before the creation of the universe,
and that he was one of the major powers of the Three Realms. Even the
[Starseizing Hand] he developed was so powerful…he most assuredly
must have comprehended a Grand Dao. Only, I wonder if Daoist
Threelives was able to comprehend a Heavenly Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, enough of
that. Two thousand black-white pellets!” Ning looked at the jade
bottle in his hands. “And I earned quite a few black-white pellets
during the Dao Debates as well. Should I go to the Dao Repository
Vault to exchange them for techniques?” Ning began to ponder. “For
divine abilities? Or for the [Soulshaker Art]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment, a
voice was transmitted towards him. “Ji Ning.” This voice echoed
in his mind. “Master.” Ning hurriedly looked around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go back and calm
your mind and focus on your training. You must solidify your
foundation to fully reap the gains from these Dao Debates. I trust
you will make even more advancements if you do. Three days later,
come and see me.” Immortal Diancai’s voice rang out in Ning’s
mind. As for the four Immortals in the corner of the room, Immortal
Diancai, the short elder, the juvenile child, and the crowned,
bearded elder all gave Ning a final look before disappearing into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared around
within the Dao Debate Palace, but saw no one else present. Still, he
acknowledged respectfully, “Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
boarded his flying boat. Transforming into a streak of light, he flew
out of the Dao Debate Palace and returned to his Darknorth Peak. He
was going to calm his heart and solidify the gains he had recently
reaped.

Chapter 2 - Northmont Blacktiger’s Style
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat soared
through the skies, entering the Darknorth Peak’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Forgard, Cloudship, and Cloudjade, the
three Zifu Disciples, all called out with respect. The Whitewater
Hound next to them looked towards Ning as well, and Ning grinned
towards him. “Uncle White, I’m going to go into my private
training room to engage in some closed-door training. Only call me if
there is something extremely important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
nodded. Ning then went directly into his private training room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade nibbled on
her lips as she stared at Ning. “He just glanced at me. He didn’t
even give me a good look. Hmph. Back in the tribe, there were so many
people who wanted to become Dao-Companions with me. But this senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning hasn’t even engaged in a proper
conversation with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade’s alluring
charm was indeed tremendous. The fox spirits and other beautiful
maidservants which Ning had seen in the Carefree Caverns were all
inferior to her. Even Ninelotus was slightly inferior to her. The
only one comparable to her was that reincarnated Immortal, the
Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei. No wonder Cloudjade had always been
self-confident!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She naturally wanted to
reel in this disciples of the Black-White College. This Ji Ning, in
her mind, truly was the best selection for her to become
Dao-Companions with. But unfortunately…up till now, Ji Ning had
never said a word to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
it!” Cloudjade mused to herself silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how the
battles at the Dao Debate Palace went.” Cloudship, by her side, had
a look of anticipation in his shining eyes. “None of us know,”
Forgard said gravely. Cloudship glanced at Forgard, then pursed his
lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
training room. Ning sat there in the lotus position, streaks of sword
energy flying around him, occasionally chopping, occasionally
stabbing, occasionally blocking. One stance after another came
out…they appeared ordinary, but they contained a truly
heart-shaking fierceness to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, all of the
sword energies around him vanished. “Whew.” A hint of a smile
appeared on Ning’s face. “I’ve spent an entire night training,
and I have indeed made further gains, as well as solidified my
previous insights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Dao of the
Sword? Sword Immortal?” A look of anticipation was in Ning’s
eyes. Whoosh. Ning rose to his feet, and the stone door opened with a
rumble. Soon, he arrived outside the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a hint of
light in the skies. Ning stood there in the courtyard, and as he took
in a deep breath of air, filled with dense amounts of natural,
elemental energy, he felt all the happier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” A soft voice suddenly rang out nearby.
Ning turned to look. It was Cloudjade, dressed in a light pink Daoist
robe. Although the robe was rather loose and large, on her
incomparably ravishing body, it gave an alluring feeling that was
both faint and bone-deep. Her long black hair was simply combed, but
it also gave off a natural, magnetic aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She truly is a
lovely person. Why in the world did Baiwei have her come and be my
retainer?” Ning mused to himself. Although Cloudjade was indeed
exquisite in her appearance, what Ning wanted was to be truly
carefree and unbound. How could he so casually select a
Dao-Companion? Even if he were to choose one, it would be an
incomparably major affair. For now, at least, this Cloudjade hadn’t
moved Ning’s heart in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t had a
chance to thank you yet, senior apprentice-brother, for giving me the
chance to enter your service and join the Black-White College.”
Cloudjade’s willowy, graceful body curtsied in a show of respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
Suddenly, a figure ran over from outside. It was a young servant. The
young servant couldn’t help but glance towards that exalted,
insurpassably seductive Immortal practitioner, Cloudjade, but then he
hurriedly said in a nervous manner, “Master, someone is outside,
and he claims to be your senior apprentice-brother. He’s right at
the door. He’s already been waiting for the amount of time needed
to boil a kettle of tea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded,
then laughed and said in clear voice, “Which senior
apprentice-brother is it, might I ask? I’ve neglected you by making
you wait here for so long, senior apprentice-brother. Please, come
in, quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and go prepare
refreshments,” Ning said, looking at the nearby Cloudjade.
“Alright.” Cloudjade hurriedly bowed, then quickly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ordinary, mortal
youth had cold sweat rolling down his back. He hurriedly left as
well. Just now, when he had taken a secret glance at that
unsurpassingly alluring beauty, Cloudjade, he felt as though he had
seen one of the legendary fairies. At the same time, he sighed to
himself, “If I could have a fairy like her as my woman, even if I
could only live for an hour, I would be satisfied. And yet, Master
doesn’t even care about a maiden like her at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” A youth dressed in a black Daoist robe
came walking in. His eyes seemed to contain the stars in them, and a
smile was on his face. “I previously met you both during the grand
entrance ceremony as well as the Dao Debate Palace, but I hadn’t
had the chance to say anything to you. My name is Hu Yongchun, and my
Daoist title is the same as my name; Yongchun, meaning ‘Everspring’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Everspring, please come in.” Ning, as an
Immortal practitioner, had an incomparably perfect memory. He
remembered that during the Dao Debates, this Everspring had been by
the side of the fat, sloppy-looking youth. Someone who was able to
stand directly next to that youth was most likely one of the fairly
talented Wanxiang Adepts of the College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two fellow
disciples sat there facing each other, while Cloudjade delivered fine
wine and fruits to them. “Junior apprentice-brother, you have quite
a lovely lady here.” Everspring laughed as he delivered a few words
of praise, and Cloudjade’s face turned slightly red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “She’s
just taking the chance to train under my service.” “Oh.”
Everspring nodded. He immediately noted that this junior
apprentice-brother of his seemed to hold no interest at all in this
devilishly attractive maiden, and so he didn’t mention her any
further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade served the
two, watching as Ji Ning and Everspring, two formal disciples of the
Black-White College, chatted and laughed amongst themselves. At
first, she had been filled with eagerness, but towards the end, she
felt vaguely heartsick. At first, Everspring had praised her beauty,
but afterwards, both he and her own master, Ji Ning, had completely
focused on their conversation, not sparing so much as a glance for
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
blessed by the heavens with talent; clearly, they didn’t care about
her appearance. This truly hurt her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning!” Suddenly, a voice rang out from
outside. “Another one,” Ning mused to himself. The reason why he
had left the private training room so early today was precisely
because he realized that his performance during the Dao Debates had
probably attracted the attention of quite a few fellow disciples, who
would come in order to make friends with him. In turn, the more
friends he had amongst his fellow disciples, the better it would be
for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formal disciples of
the Black-White College, after all, were people who outsiders would
view as extremely hard to befriend, even if they wanted to. One
formal disciple after another arrived, either alone or in pairs or
triplets, causing the courtyard to become quite rowdy. Every so
often, one of them would leave, but there would always be from three
to five people within the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade, as his
female servant, naturally served them personally. What hurt her the
most was…aside from those senior apprentices who offered her a kind
word of praise, there was only a single senior apprentice-brother out
of the twenty-plus formal disciples who gave her so much as a close
look. That senior apprentice-brother’s Daoist title was ‘Joybliss’.
According to what he said, he delighted in tandem-training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These disciples of
the Black-White College, aside from that one that likes to engage in
tandem-training, truly all have extraordinary Dao-hearts.” In the
end, Cloudjade could only sigh to herself in amazement. Indeed,
everyone capable of joining the Black-White College was a peerless
talent. And, from the sounds of it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her own master, Ji
Ning, was one of the most outstanding members of this group of
peerless talents, someone who could be described as a monster! This
was why so many fellow apprentice-brothers and apprentice-sisters had
come to befriend him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, I brought two of my junior
apprentice-sisters over as well Would you be willing to meet them?”
A soft voice rang out, and instantly, Ji Ning and the two people he
was chatting with turned their heads. They soon saw three streaks of
light moving towards them through the air from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, since you wish to meet with me, how
would I dare refuse?” Ning raised his head to stare at Ninelotus,
high in the sky. Ninelotus was accompanied by a lovely woman dressed
in red robes as well as a silver-robed maiden with a fierce aura. The
three women landed from the skies at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They…” Upon
seeing these three senior apprentice-sisters descend, Cloudjade
suddenly had a sense of self-contempt in her heart. The bearing and
aura of these three…only they were truly worthy of being referred
to as fairies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is junior
apprentice-sister Qingqing, while this is junior apprentice-sister
Whitewater.” Ninelotus laughed as she looked towards Ning.
“Greetings to you, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Both the
willowy, red-robed woman and the silver-robed maiden looked towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only with the arrival
of nightfall did Ning’s Darknorth Peak return to its usual calm.
His fellow disciples had all left. Only…one more person had
arrived. It was Northmont Baiwei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei, sit.” Ning
and Baiwei sat down. Baiwei smiled and said, “I knew that you would
definitely be very busy today, and that quite a few of your
colleagues would definitely come visit you. So, I intentionally
waited until it was almost dark before coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei, you truly
are formidable,” Ning said in praise. Baiwei laughed loudly. “How
could I not guess that this would happen? Right; today, I’ve come
at the orders of my father.” Ning was startled. “Your father?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont
Blacktiger…the intimidating aura of that man filled Ning with fear.
He definitely wasn’t inferior to the headmaster of the Black-White
College, and he was a man with an exceptionally dominating,
overbearing aura! One of the candidates to be the next Marquis of
Stillwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve come here
because…?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clap, clap. Baiwei
clapped his hands twice. Instantly, the two Zifu Disciple servants
standing behind him immediately moved forward. They each took out
multiple black jade platters from their storage-type magic treasures.
These black jade platters were all engraved with the exquisite
carving of a black tiger, and the platters themselves were crystal
clear, incomparably beautiful works of art. Atop each platter, there
were multiple items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were, in total,
six black jade platters. They had on them a pair of jade bottles, a
small boat, a set of black wings, and two sets of flying swords that
were the size of sewing needles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are two sets
of flying swords. One has 72 flying swords, while the other has 18.
They are all excellent Mortal-ranked flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This set of black
wings…is a high-grade Mortal-ranked wing-type magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This boat is a
top-grade flying magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This jade bottle
holds a miasma gas treasure, which is a type of fleeing treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This other jade
bottle holds five hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.”
Baiwei said, with composure and assurance, “Accept all of these
things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was poleaxed. He
could clearly tell that these were all extraordinary gifts. Aside
from the set of black wings, which was slightly poorer, the others
were extremely valuable. “This…how can I accept this?” Ning
hurriedly refused. “It’s too expensive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father ordered me
to come here, and I’ve already delivered the items. Everything else
has nothing to do with me.” Baiwei waved his hands and said, “You
don’t have to be modest. You and my father have had the chance to
meet each other, and my father has given these congratulatory gifts
with good intentions. Just accept them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated
momentarily. Since Baiwei and himself were good friends, there now
existed an irreversible relationship between himself and Northmont
Blacktiger’s Estate. Since that was the case, he might as well
accept them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more like
it! No point in not accepting my father’s things, and these aren’t
that important for someone like him,” Baiwei said. “Oh, right.
You asked me to search for that Meng Roch. I’ve already found him.
It’s true; he hasn’t been able to join any sect at all. Do you
want for me to send someone to deliver him directly to the
Black-White College?”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meng Roch?” Ning’s
eyes lit up. Although he had only known Roch for a few days when they
met on the way to Stillwater City, he felt extremely well-disposed
towards Roch. In addition, the fact that he was willing to sacrifice
his own life for others meant that he was someone worthy of Ning’s
assistance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudship!” Ning
called out in a high voice. Cloudship soon hurried over, bowing and
saying with respect, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you wanted
me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
pointed to the nearby Northmont Baiwei. “Baiwei, in a short while,
lead this Cloudship and arrange for someone to send Cloudship to Meng
Roch’s place. Let Cloudship bring Roch back to the Black-White
College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Baiwei
nodded. Ning looked towards Cloudship. “Cloudship, do you hear and
understand?” The reason why he wanted Cloudship to go was because
he could tell that Cloudship was a lively fellow who was able to make
snap decisions based on the actual situation. Whatever Ning asked him
to do, he would definitely do perfectly well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudship immediately
nodded. “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, don’t worry. I will
definitely invite Meng Roch over.” “Good.” Only now did Ning
nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei laughed. “I’ve
carried out my father’s tasks as well. Next are the gifts that I
personally prepared for you.” “Baiwei, what are you…” Ning
hurriedly moved to refuse, but Baiwei immediately interjected, “Don’t
decline. You and I are brothers. You have entered the Black-White
College, and had a glorious performance at the Dao Debate. As your
brother, how can I not prepare a congratulatory gift? Don’t worry;
because of the restrictions which Father placed on me, I’m not as
wealthy or as generous as Father, and my gift isn’t that valuable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a laugh.
If Baiwei had already put things this way, what else could he, Ning,
do? Baiwei waved his hand, and a thick, seemingly ordinary-looking
book appeared. Although this book seemed to be made from excellent
materials, Ning couldn’t notice anything special about it at first
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that quite
soon, you’ll be going out to do some adventuring. Immortal
practitioners all must be tempered by countless life-and-death
experiences. Only then will we be able to walk farther on our
Immortal paths.” Baiwei laughed and continued, “Thus, I prepared
a map for you! This is a map of the entire Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning called out in
shock, “The entire Xia Dynasty?” The Xia Dynasty was unimaginably
vast! “Don’t get too excited. The Xia Dynasty is enormous, and
this map only goes into detail regarding our Stillwater Commandery.
It only has some rough information regarding the distant places of
the vast Xia Dynasty, which is thousands of times larger than our
commandery. At least, however, you won’t get lost.” Baiwei was a
bit resigned. “A detailed map of the entire Xia Dynasty is
something which even I don’t have access to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed inwardly.
To Immortal practitioners who went out adventuring, the importance of
a good map was unquestionable. This was because there were simply far
too many mysteries, dangers, and terrifying locations in this vast
world. If one moved about blindly and ignorantly, one might
accidentally charge into a fatal area. If that happened, one really
would die a miserable death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I’ve done
what I need to, it’s time for me to leave.” Baiwei rose and
laughed, “I know that for a genius like you, your training time is
quite precious.” Ning rose to his feet as well and asked, “Leaving
so soon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Black-White
College is within Stillwater City. I can come any time.” Baiwei led
his servants and Cloudship, then quickly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as Baiwei
and the others transformed into streaks of light and departed. Only
now did he lower his head to stare at the six jade platters of
treasures that were before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] just so happened to be lacking in swords, and now
I’ve received two sets of them.” Ning stared at the two sets of
flying swords; one a set of 72, the other a set of 18. The set of 18
swords in particular appeared to be all exceptionally fine flying
swords. “Although I haven’t used the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] many times, Northmont Blacktiger clearly knew long ago
that I need a large number of flying swords. He really lives up to
his reputation as being a potential candidate for the next Marquis of
Stillwater. His information really is reliable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a Zifu Disciple,
it should’t be too hard for me to cobble together seven hundred or
so Mortal-ranked flying swords. But once I reach the Wanxiang Adept
level, I’ll need seven hundred or so Earth-ranked flying swords. As
a Primal Daoist, I’ll need Heaven-ranked flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed to himself.
The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was something which caused
even Immortal Juhua concern. Ning also possessed the [Nuwa Painting],
and walked the path of the Sword Immortal. Indeed, the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] was extremely well suited for him. Most
likely, the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], in his hands, would
be even more effective than it had been for the Thousand Swords
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to view
the treasures. “Wings?” Ning looked at the black wings atop the
jade platter. “They are much better than the wings I acquired after
killing the disciples of Snowdragon Mountain.” The wings weren’t
that useful for Ning, as he primarily used them to cover-up the fact
that he used the [Windwing Evasion].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a divine
ability which the ancestor of the Yuchi clan had only acquired after
rescuing a Celestial Immortal, who in his gratitude had bestowed it
upon the clan. It was abundantly clear from the fact that even the
entire Black-White College only had five divine abilities that divine
abilities were incomparably precious. No wonder the Yuchi clan
insisted on using wing-type magic treasures to disguise themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The flying boat!”
Ning stared at the fourth present, then laughed. “A top-grade
Mortal-ranked magic treasure. In the future, I’ll be able to travel
much more quickly.” Ning stretched his hands out, effortlessly
binding both the wings and the boat-type magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The miasma gas magic
treasure.” Ning stared at the fifth treasure. He picked up that
white jade bottle. After easily binding it, he discovered that
within, there was a white pearl, surrounded by an extremely dense
foggy white miasma gas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Step back. Go far
away.” Ning swept the surrounding area with his gaze, and the
nearby Cloudjade hurriedly retreated all the way out of the
courtyard. “Activate.” Ning willed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a large
amount of white miasma gas filled the courtyard. The white miasma gas
covered an area of many tens of meters, and the density of it was
such that even Ning’s Fiendgod-enhanced eyes were only just barely
able to view his own fingers. In fact, it even influenced the
surrounding elemental ki flow, causing Ning to be unable to sense
what was around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what I
hear, miasma gas magic treasures are extremely suited for fleeing,
precisely because they prevent both vision with the naked eye as well
as sensing one’s surroundings.” Ning nodded lightly. “So it
really is the case. Even I, the person who released the miasma gas,
am unable to see the surrounding area. Once I release this miasma
gas…for a short period of time, my foe will be unable to find me. I
can choose a direction and immediately flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miasma gases were
unable to distinguish from friend or foe. What Ning bound was the
jade bottle and the pearl within it; that miasma gas simply existed
within the pearl itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if my
divine sense can see through it.” Ning willed it, and
suddenly…whoosh! His divine sense spread out, instantly
encompassing the entire courtyard. “Eh?” Ning revealed a hint of
delight. Although the miasma gas was so powerful as to be able to
disturb the flow of natural elemental energy, under Ning’s divine
sense…everything still appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning
was overjoyed. “To others, miasma gas magic-treasures are only for
fleeing, but for me…I can release the miasma gas to befuddle my
foes, then engage them and kill them in close quarters.” This
combat tactic instantly flashed through Ning’s mind. Given that his
own divine sense was not affected by the gas, in the future, it would
be much easier for him to deal with Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another killer
move,” Ning laughed. Ning then looked towards the sixth jade
platter. Five hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental essence! This
was an astonishing fortune; ordinary Earth-ranked magic treasures
were worth merely five kilograms, which was to say that this gift was
the equivalent of a hundred Earth-ranked magic treasures! Even if he
wanted powerful Earth-ranked magic treasures, he would still be able
to trade for eight or ten of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even when Baiwei and
Fox had been betting frantically against each other, the stakes had
only gone up to forty or fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Blacktiger
really is quite generous.” Ning no longer hesitated; he collected
the treasures, picked up the jade bottles, and headed for his private
training room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. The jade flask was placed in front of him, and the stopper had
been pulled open. Ning sat in the lotus position atop the jade bed,
calming himself down. He opened his mouth, and the liquefied
elemental essence within the jade bottle instantly began to fly out
and be absorbed by Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous Zifu Lake
within the illusory space of the Zifu Violet Palace. The watersource
suddenly began to surge with large amounts of pure elemental energy.
The entire Zifu Lake began to swirl about expand in an incomparably
rapid pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outer regions of
the Zifu Lake were constantly expanding towards every direction. The
lake was growing to take up a larger and larger amount of the
illusory space, and began to surge towards the deepest recesses of
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Expanding! It was still
expanding! Fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. A hundred.
A hundred fifty…Ning didn’t hesitate at all, constantly refining
and absorbing it all. His base was solid, and his comprehension of
the Dao was quite high. His divine soul was very strong, and his
sword-heart was lustrous…he absolutely could surge all the way to
the early Wanxiang Adept stage if he so chose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Lake continued
to expand. It now covered a truly shocking amount of space, and could
even be said to have expanded from a ‘lake’ to a ‘sea’. A
Zifu Sea!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred
kilograms. Three hundred fifty kilograms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, I used
forty or so kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. This time, if I
use another 360 kilograms, it’ll be about enough,” Ning mused to
himself. According to the [Flowing Watersource], if one refined four
hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental essence as a Zifu Disciple,
then the foundation that one would establish would be the so-called
‘foundation for a Celestial Immortal’. The Manifestation one
would later have would also be the best of Manifestations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” 355
kilograms. 360 kilograms. 365 kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why doesn’t my
Zifu Lake feel as though it has reached its maximum capacity yet?”
Ning was feeling rather puzzled, and he slowed down the rate at which
he was refining liquefied elemental essence as well. Some of the
weaker Ki Refining techniques made it so that the practitioner’s
Zifu Lake would at best be able to withstand fifty kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence. But Ning had already been able to
withstand more than four hundred kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">370 kilograms…390
kilograms…400 kilograms! Ning opened his eyes, halting his
training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, I used
forty kilograms, and this time, I used four hundred. And yet, my
Violet Palace is able to continue to accumulate more?” Ning
frowned. Although the [Waterstream Source] hadn’t described an
upper limit in detail, and there were small differences in each
person’s capacity, generally speaking, four hundred kilograms
should be quite close to the limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll halt for now.
In two days, when I meet Master, I’ll ask him.” Ning halted his
training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was training.
In a quite, secluded courtyard within East Stillwater City. Roch was
seated in the lotus position on his bed, quietly nourishing his own
Zifu Violet Palace. His Violet Palace had been damaged; naturally, he
had to carefully cultivate it and heal it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky, Rocky, come
out, quick!” A frantic voice rang out. “Uncle Ming?” Roch came
to an immediate halt, leaving the bed and walking out. “Uncle Ming,
what is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch pushed the door
opened, then saw the bald, middle-aged man, his entire face covered
with urgency. Roch felt extremely grateful towards Uncle Ming; at
least Uncle Ming had let him stay here this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you cause
trouble or offend someone? A guard of Stillwater Commandery has come
in search of you.” The bald-headed, middle-aged Uncle Ming was
utterly frantic right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Roch shook
his head. “I haven’t.” Uncle Ming hurriedly said, “Enough
talk. Hurry, go see him.” Although he had safely secured this
quiet, secluded little residence for himself in Stillwater City,
compared to the exalted Marquisate of Stillwater…he was like an ant
in front of a divine dragon. No - he wasn’t even an ant. He was
nothing more than a speck of sand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch, his face covered
with puzzlement and unease, quickly appeared before the gates of the
estate. In front of the gates, there were two armored Zifu Disciple
guards, and next to them was a white-robed youth. The two guards were
standing behind this white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this,
although he felt terror in his heart, Roch also felt a hint of
bitterness. “To be able to have guards of the Marquis of Stillwater
stand behind me…how long will it be before I can be at this level?”
Roch felt sourness in his heart. “I’m not even able to join a
school right now. Not a single school wants me. How long will it be
before I am able to continue walking down my Immortal path!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, skinny,
white-robed man, upon seeing Roch, immediately revealed a smile. “Are
you Brother Meng Roch?” “Brother…Meng Roch?” Roch stared. The
bald Uncle Ming, by his side, was astonished as well. He hurriedly
said, “Yes, he’s Meng Roch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, skinny,
white-robed man laughed. “My name is Cloudship. I have come on the
orders of my master, Ji Ning, to invite you, Brother Meng Roch, to
the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___A_Sturdy_Base"></A>
Chapter 4 - A Sturdy Base
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Roch was
completely stunned. Ji Ning? Of course he knew Ji Ning. This was the
man who had saved his life. In the Carefree Caverns, he had watched
as Ji Ning and another youth were welcomed with great splendor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask who your
master, Ji Ning, is?” Roch was somewhat hesitant. Was this the same
Ji Ning he knew?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is a
formal disciple of the Black-White College.” The tall, skinny,
white-robed Cloudship laughed. “When he entered the Black-White
College, he consecutively defeated multiple senior fellow disciples,
and even several Wanxiang Adepts were defeated by him. Brother Meng
Roch, my master has invited you to go; will you go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go? Of course he’ll
go.” The bald Uncle Ming, standing nearby, immediately urged Roch
to go. At the same time, he sent Roch mentally, “Rocky, your stroke
of good fortune has arrived! That Ji Ning is a monstrous talent and
has successfully entered the Black-White College as a formal
disciple. The formal disciples of the Black-White College are
permitted ten retainer positions, and by the look of things, this
youth is one of them. If Ji Ning is inviting you to go…it’s very
possible that you’ve received one of those ten positions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch, hearing this
mental transmission, was shocked. One of the ten formal retainerships
for a formal disciple? The Black-White College was an incomparably
exalted place; it was the most powerful school of the entire
Stillwater Commandery, and a place where peerless geniuses gathered!
Even the retainers of the peerless geniuses, as long as they worked
hard and rendered merits unto the school, would have the chance to
learn some truly top-tier Ki Refining techniques. This was far better
than being a formal disciple of the Thousand Rivers School.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that those extremely large schools were divided into outer court
disciples, inner court disciples, main disciples, and the most
supreme, core disciples. There were multiple layers of status. In the
Black-White College, however, there were only formal disciples and
retainers; two layers. Thus, even retainerships were positions that
were deeply coveted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have a chance
to enter the Black-White College?” Roch’s heart was filled with
all sorts of ideas. “Uh, Brother Meng Roch?” Cloudship said with
a touch of urgency. “Ah?!” Roch frantically nodded. “Go, go, of
course I’ll go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White
College. Cloudship and Roch had both transformed into streaks of
light and were flying in the air. “Look. That is Darknorth Peak,
the place where my master, Ji Ning, resides.” Cloudship pointed
towards a distant, elegant mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he passed
through the formal gates of the Black-White College, Roch’s mind
was filled with all sorts of wild thoughts. He…he had actually
entered the Black-White College? The nearby Cloudship really was one
of the ten retainers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The two charged
down into the courtyard, quickly landing outside of its gates. The
two young gate guards outside the gate all saluted respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is such a
thick elemental aura here.” After stepping into the courtyard, Roch
could sense an incomparably dense elemental aura presence. “The
elemental aura in Stillwater City is already dense enough as it is,
but this estate actually has a ki-gathering formation that is
operating at all times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch was now growing
rather nervous. Cloudship was leading him through a hallway, and they
soon passed through a door, at which point they arrived at a wide,
spacious estate. In the center of this estate, there was a fur-clad
youth, who had a peerlessly bewitching beauty by his side, waiting on
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already very
late at night. The figure of the fur-clad youth seemed quite blurry
and unclear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning!”
Roch, upon seeing the fur-clad youth, couldn’t help but blurt these
words out. “Rocky!” Ning rose to his feet and walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch was rather
reserved and nervous right now. This was no longer the same Ji Ning
who had come to this city alongside him in search of a school. This
was a formal disciple of the Black-White College, the number one
school of the entire Stillwater Commandery. And, from what Cloudship
said…it seemed as though even in the Black-White College, Ji Ning
was quite the standout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be nervous,”
Ning laughed, then asked, “Meng Xin and Meng Jun?” “The two of
them both entered schools.” Roch said hurriedly, “Both of them
are at the early Zifu Stage, and so it was easy for them to join a
school. They both entered the Thousand Rivers School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When saying this, Roch
felt a bit of pain in his heart. He had originally wanted to join the
same school as Meng Xin, but unfortunately, his foundation had been
damaged and not a single school wanted him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousand Rivers
School?” Ning nodded slowly. “After becoming a formal disciple of
the Black-White College, I have ten retainer positions. I don’t
know if you’d be willing to become a retainer under my control?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch’s eyes instantly
lit up, and his body began to tremble slightly. “I’m willing!”
Roch said hurriedly. Ning laughed. “You’ll only be a retainer in
name. The two of us will still treat each other as brothers. Oh,
right. There’s something you must understand…the Black-White
College has quite a few internal rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Roch
nodded vigorously. What he was afraid of was that he would have no
hope for the future. Since he had already joined the Black-White
College, a wide route for his Immortal path had just appeared before
him. Naturally, he would exert all possible effort to grow
increasingly powerful. He walk would ever-farther along the Immortal
path, and in his heart, he murmured to himself: “Little Xin. Wait
for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…” Roch looked
at Ning. His eyes were somewhat red. With a thud, he suddenly fell
down to his knees, then kowtowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky!” Ning
hurriedly went to pull him up. “Brother Ji Ning, you saved my life,
and now you’ve given me my Immortal path back. I, Meng Roch, have
nothing to repay you with. So long as you give the order, even if I
must climb a mountain of blades or enter a sea of flames, I will
charge forward.” Roch looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Rise,
rise.” Right at this moment, the nearby Cloudjade actually
grumbled, “Given senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s talent and
power, how can he possibly need your help?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudjade.” Ning
gave the Cloudjade a glance, then instructed, “Go make the
arrangements for some food. Rocky and I are going to have a good
chat.” Compared to his other three retainers, Ning felt more
well-disposed towards Roch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Cloudjade
turned and immediately departed, but while doing so, she was secretly
grumbling to herself. “Yet another hunk of wood!” That Meng Roch
fellow, upon entering, had given her just a single glance. She was
beginning to question her own seductiveness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morning sun rose,
spreading its dim light throughout the entire Black-White College.
Everything appeared so dreamlike and illusory. Ning was atop a flying
boat. Transforming into a streak of light, he flew out of Darknorth
Peak. Soon afterwards, he arrived in the air above the mountain of
his master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
landed in the courtyard, then called out respectfully. “Come in.”
Immortal Diancai’s voice transmitted to him from outside. Ning
immediately entered, and the servants at the gate naturally did not
bar his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall. The
black-robed, black-haired Immortal Diancai was seated in the lotus
position atop a ‘bed’ of clouds. He looked at Ning, and he felt
as though the more he saw him, the more satisfied he was with him.
Being able to teach an extremely talented disciple made him feel
quite successful as well. Immortal Diancai said in a calm voice, “Ji
Ning, how did your three days of meditation go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple has
made considerable gains!” Ning said respectfully. “Mm.”
Immortal Diancai nodded slowly, then narrowed his eyes. “Previously,
Headmaster Jadesea has already informed you regarding the Great Dao
of the Sword, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword,”
Immortal Diancai said slowly, “Is a killing tool. It is also the
tool which we Immortal cultivators will use in our ascent to the
peak, in slaughtering all who would impede our path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the Sword
is a type of combat-focused Dao. Sword Immortals, in turn, are
Immortal cultivators that are extremely skilled in combat.”
Immortal Diancai laughed as he looked at Ning. “Do you know…what
the Dao of the Sword is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
And then, lost, he shook his head. He had just entered the earliest
realm of comprehension regarding this Grand Dao of the Sword, and
knew almost nothing at all about it. What is the Dao of the Sword? He
really didn’t know how to respond to such a question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some Daos are Daos
involving the mysteries underpinning the way in which the world
operates. For example, your Rainwater Dao. The Dao of Freezing Ice.
The Dao of Mystic Ice. And more! All of them are Daos regarding the
profundities of the natural world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. These
were, indeed, all natural Daos. The techniques one came up with after
comprehending these Daos would all be referred to as ‘arts’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arts are a way to
apply the Daos. The ‘sword arts’ are that which you generally use
when wielding the sword. To reach a level in the sword arts which is
so high as to be a Dao of its own….that is what the Dao of the
Sword is!” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. “Thus, the Dao of the
Sword is actually a technical Dao, a Dao of applying certain
techniques and knacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just the Dao of
the Sword; the Dao of Taiji is the same. Taiji also involves the
application of certain skills and techniques. Taiji, in turn, is also
a Grand Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When, for example,
you began to gain insights into water and fire, you might be able to
apply the insights you gained into fire and water through the Dao of
Taiji, and the power will exponentially increase.” Immortal Diancai
looked at Ji Ning. “The Dao of the Sword which you have chosen as
your path, in turns, results in you applying and executing the
insights you have gained into the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded his head in
understanding. Taiji? Dao of the Sword? The application of a Dao?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Regardless of
whether it is Taiji or the Dao of the Sword, these are all extremely,
unfathomably profound Grand Daos. They are extremely hard to
comprehend.” Immortal Diancai sighed. “For example, the Dao of
the Sword requires one to comprehend and develop one’s sword-heart.
The Dao of Taiji also requires one to comprehend and develop one’s
Taiji-heart. Both are extremely difficult tasks. But upon embarking
on this Grand Dao, one’s future potential will be limitless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as he
listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember!”
Immortal Diancai looked at Ning, then said solemnly, “As a Sword
Immortal, you must have a supremely sincere heart! Sincere to the
sword, and sincere to your own heart. Do you understand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must always
reflect on your actions, and hone your sword-heart. Do not let any
dust alight on your sword-heart. You must know, a truly sincere heart
is always lustrous!” Immortal Diancai looked at Ji Ning. “You
must firmly engrave these words of mine into your heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Your disciple
will memorize them carefully, and will never dare to forget them,”
Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Immortal
Diancai waved his hand, retrieving a leather scroll which he handed
to Ning. Ning accepted it, slightly puzzled. “During these three
days,” Immortal Diancai said, “I’ve been carefully considering
your earlier performance during the Dao Debates. In the end, I
selected thirty-six sword arts manuals for you. Afterwards, when you
go to the Dao Repository Vault, go trade for the thirty-six manuals
recorded on this leather scroll.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty six?” Ning
was stunned. “I am to go trade for them?” Although he had just
embarked on the path of the Dao of the Sword and had received two
thousand black-white pellets…thirty-six sword arts manuals?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. These
are all Earth-ranked or Heaven-ranked sword arts. In addition, I’m
only having you trade for the first scrolls. In total, they will only
cost six hundred black-white pellets,” Immortal Diancai said. Only
now did Ning let out a sigh of relief. Six hundred black-white
pellets was indeed not too great a cost for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although they are
only Earth-ranked and Heaven-ranked sword arts, and although you are
only trading for their first scrolls, they will be enough for you to
use at the Zifu Disciple level and at the Wanxiang Adept level,”
Immortal Diancai said. “These are all sword arts which, if placed
within some lesser tribes, would be considered peerless sword arts
that serve as the foundation for the entire tribe. Carefully read
through these sword arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first reason I
am having you peruse so many different sword arts is to raise your
level of insights into the Dao of the Sword,” Immortal Diancai said
with a a laugh. “Second is, the more you see and the more you
study, the greater your experiences and understanding will be. In the
future, when you are adventuring and battling in the outside world,
you’ll be able to advance more quickly and benefit from this
study.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then, to the Dao
Repository Vault. After today, one day each month, you may come visit
me and ask me some of the questions which have mystified you in your
day-to-day training,” Immortal Diancai said. “Once I feel your
foundation is solid enough, then I’ll permit you to leave the
Black-White College and go temper yourself in wandering the outside
world. If you stay forever under the protection of your elders, there
is no way you’ll be able to become a true Immortal. Only when you
live beneath the pounding of the rain and the howling of the wind,
when you are tempered by life-and-death battles, will you be reborn
into a mighty Immortal who does not fear the Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
“Understood.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, your
disciple has one more issue.” Ji Ning was still thinking about how,
even after using four hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence, his Zifu Lake hadn’t reached its limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Immortal
Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly said,
“Your disciple has trained in the [Flowing Watersource]. In total,
I’ve used 405 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. According
to the [Flowing Watersource], 400 kilograms is enough to establish a
‘foundation for a Celestial Immortal’, and if one tries to refine
even more, one will quickly reach a limit. However, my Zifu Violet
Palace has not yet reached the limit. Why is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Immortal
Diancai laughed. “Hahaha, most Immortal practitioners are vexed by
their Violet Palace’s not being able to absorb enough elemental ki
and their foundation not being sufficiently stable. But you are
complaining about your Violet Palace being able to absorb too much?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not it,”
Ning said hurriedly. “I just am puzzled, and I don’t understand
why I am unique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
laughed. “This is because your body is the body of a Fiendgod! It
would be one thing if you had an ordinary Fiendgod body, but yours is
one which has been created by the legendary, number one Fiendgod Body
Refining Technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
It is a truly perfect Fiendgod body, no weaker than that of a mighty
Fiendgod who was born from the natural world. It only makes sense
that the Zifu Lake within your Fiendgod body is able to withstand a
tremendous amount of elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning now
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, the better
a Ki Refining technique is, the more stable one’s foundation will
be. Perhaps you’ll spend a bit more time at the Zifu or the
Wanxiang levels, but the further you go, the easier your life will
be,” Immortal Diancai said. “Also; there are some other
techniques that are also Immortal-ranked, but are even better than
even the [Flowing Watersource], which allows one to use five hundred
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence at the Zifu Disciple stage.
The more powerful a technique, the more elemental ki it is able to
control.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. “You should be happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ning said. “However, how much liquefied elemental
essence does your disciple need to use before advancing to the
Wanxiang level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
pondered for a moment, then said, “Disciples who train in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] who also train in the
[Flowing Watersource] are indeed quite rare…let me think about it.
Mm. Mmm. Yes, I imagine you will need around eight hundred to one
thousand kilograms or so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sucked in a cold
breath upon hearing this. Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. “The
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is the number one
Fiendgod Body Refining Technique in the world. You must practice it
with diligence as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded, then added, “Then I’ll go to the Dao Repository Vault
now.” Immortal Diancai nodded. “Go,” he said, then closed his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning depart. As he left
the room, he boarded his flying boat and soared into the skies,
heading to the Dao Repository Vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Repository
Vault. Ning headed straight for the second floor, that of the ‘arts’.
“Originally, I had 200 black-white pellets left over. From the Dao
Debates, I gained 600 black-white pellets. After embarking on the
path of the Sword Immortal, the College bestowed me with two thousand
black-white pellets. I have a total of 2800 black-white pellets.”
Ning carefully searched through the countless books placed on the
bookstacks. He was searching for the thirty-six sword arts manuals
which his master had instructed him to find on that leather scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite cheap. This
one is only thirty black-white pellets. Mm, this one is just ten.
Ouch, this one is actually a hundred.” Ning moved as fast as the
wind, and his eyes scanned the books as fast as lightning. He moved
past large stacks of sword arts manuals, quickly picking out all
thirty-six books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cheapest of these
thirty-six books was just ten black-white pellets, while the most
expensive was a hundred. However, these were all seemingly random,
disjointed manuals; there were strange sword arts, tyrannical sword
arts, fast sword arts…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of a sea of
sword arts manuals, Master actually chose these thirty-six after
considering things for me. From this, one can imagine how many sword
arts manuals Master has read.” Ning sighed to himself in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, to become a
truly mighty Sword Immortal, it was also important to read many sword
arts manuals. “Not bad. This sword art is even more suited to me
than the [Duality Azureflame Sword].” As Ning flipped through the
books, his eyes instantly began to light up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After choosing the
thirty-six books, Ning came to another table. Atop the table, there
were five abridged books. They were: [Heavenly Transformation],
[Divine Thunderbolt Eye], [Myriad Hibernating Venoms], [Three Heads,
Six Arms], and [Eye of the Luminous Heart].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine abilities.”
Ning pondered to himself. “I only have 2200 black-white pellets
left. Should I choose a divine ability, or a skill for my divine
sense.” Divine sense techniques were even rarer than divine
abilities; the Black-White College only had three books. The
[Soulshaker Art], the [Soulcharmer Art], and the [Soulslayer Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine abilities and
divine sense techniques were equally attractive to Ning. He wanted
both. “If only I could choose whatever I wanted…” Ning gritted
his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He gave one last,
regretful glance to those five abridged books, then turned and left,
moving directly towards the other table filled with divine sense
techniques. Atop the table, there were a total of three golden books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not hesitating at all,
Ning picked up one of the golden books, then straightforwardly
departed the Dao Repository Vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon Ning leaving the
Vault, the tall, muscular, armored Dao-Protector looked at him.
“You’ve made your choice?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Take it.”
Ning handed it over, and when he did, he couldn’t help but turn to
look back at the Dao Repository Vault. His divine abilities! He
really, really wanted to acquire a few divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, that [Eye
of the Luminous Heart] also had a side-effect pertaining to divine
sense, and was extremely mysterious and profound. But the cost of the
first scroll alone was five thousand black-white pellets. For the
[Divine Thunderbolt Eye], one could immediately open a third, divine
eye which was able to draw in and store the lightning and thunder of
the world. With but a thought, one could release thunderbolts from
that divine eye! Its power was truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now…I can’t
have my cake and eat it as well,” Ning sighed to himself. “I
already have a divine ability, the [Starseizing Hand], which is
vastly superior to these divine abilities. These divine abilities, as
far as I’m concerned, are just supporting arts that can make up for
some of my weaknesses. They will not, however, noticeably increase my
real power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Soulshaker
Art], however, will allow me to be able to gain yet another killer
technique in a short period of time,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Soulshaker Art]’s
power was not related to one’s divine power or elemental ki; it
relied on the strength of one’s divine will! The stronger the
divine will, the more powerful the [Soulshaker Art] would be. His
divine will was at the level of a Primal Daoist’s by now, and with
the [Nuwa Painting], his divine soul would only continue to grow in
strength. Naturally, he had to learn a divine sense technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You didn’t choose
a divine ability?” The Dao-Protector, after looking at Ning’s
choices, was rather amazed. “Apprentice-Nephew Ji Ning, this
[Soulshaker Art] only requires a divine will to be used, but only
other Wanxiang Adepts will have a divine will as well. At most,
you’ll be able to slightly impact other Wanxiang Adepts. You train
in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; it’s best if
you choose a divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. This
Dao-Protector had no idea that his divine soul was already at the
‘divine sense’ level. “This is my choice,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your decision.”
The Dao-Protector had only chosen to say a few extra words for Ning’s
benefit. Since Ning insisted, he naturally wouldn’t say anything
else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Soulshaker Art]
requires 2000 black-white pellets, while the others need exactly
600.” The Dao-Protector looked at Ning. “I’ll destroy the
restrictive spells around these sword arts manuals, and I’ll also
go acquire the actual copies of the [Soulshaker Art] and the
Heaven-ranked sword techniques for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning paid the
2600 black-white pellets, then departed with the thirty-six sword
arts manuals as well as the [Soulshaker Art] and returned to his
Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon returning to
Darknorth Peak, Ning felt quite the itchy feeling in his heart. He
gave a few instructions, ordering that he was not to be disturbed
unless there was something important. And then, he went directly into
his private training room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back to the training
room again.” Cloudjade stared at Ning, chewing on her lips. There
was a hint of sadness in her eyes. “He won’t talk to me at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Roch cast
Cloudjade a glance, laughing inwardly. How could he not tell that
Cloudjade had been hoping to seduce Ning? “What a pity. Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s Dao-heart is incomparably firm. How
could a vixen like you possibly move him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. Ning sat down in the lotus position, immediately beginning to
flip through the [Soulshaker Art]’s complete manual. The complete
manual to the [Soulshaker Art] wasn’t too thick. After beginning to
carefully read through it, Ning started to understand…the so-called
[Soulshaker Art] was just an extremely unique way of applying the
divine will. This was a technical manual, but its value was
comparable to a divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Soulshaker
Art]?” Ning closed his eyes, beginning to ponder on what he had
read. Rumble…Ning’s powerful divine will began to spread out,
filling the entire private room, and he began to test it over and
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Failure. Failure.
Failure. Ning’s repeated failures didn’t cause him to feel the
slightest bit dispirited. Each time, he would realize what his
mistake was, and each time, he would perform better than the last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than half a month passed with Ning staying within the training
room. Because Ning had ordered his servants long ago that he was not
to be disturbed unless there was something critically important, for
this period of time, things were quite calm and quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s sea of
consciousness, there was a miniature Ji Ning, seated in the lotus
position. This was Ning’s ‘divine soul’. The divine soul sat
there in the lotus position, a runic seal repeatedly appearing and
disappearing over his chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” The azure
seal managed to remain alive for a few instants, but then was
extinguished once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning calmly absorbed
the lessons of this failure, then tried again. “Whoosh!”
Instantly, a queer azure seal once more appeared in front of the
chest of Ning’s divine soul. This seal, at first glance, appeared
to be some sort of script, but it was neither a Fiendgod character,
nor a character from any language he was aware of. When seeing this
azure rune, one felt as though a violent wave was slamming against
the shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed
his divine soul to release his tremendously powerful divine will,
which came out through that azure runic seal. The divine will which
was released wasn’t as dispersed as it was before; rather, it was a
wave that was folded together in layers. His divine sense spread out
like waves in every direction, constantly rolling forth without end.
One could imagine how, if Ning encountered a living creature with a
soul, these turbid waves of divine will would instantly smash down
against the enemy’s soul, just like a wave smashing down upon a
shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At last, I’ve
finally managed to just barely manifest the ‘Soulshaker Rune’.”
Ning opened his eyes, revealing a hint of a smile. “However, I’m
still quite far off from the true, perfect Soulshaker Rune as
mentioned in the book.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Relaxed, Ning left the
private room. By the time he arrived in the outer courtyard, he saw
that it was late at night. Outside was a sea of sparkling stars in
the night sky. Ning raised his head, staring at the sea of stars,
then laughed. “In the upcoming period of time, what I’ll need to
do is spend quite some time meditating on the Dao and on sword arts
here at the Black-White College. Only when Master nods in approval
shall I go out and temper myself through adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on like
water. Ji Ning and Mu Northson, the two new disciples of the
Black-White College, lived lives that were peaceful and yet
meaningful. They focused on comprehending the Dao, on analyzing sword
arts and the Dao of Constructs, and unconsciously, their power grew
greater and greater. The two of them had been like two pieces of
unpolished jade, but the Black-White College slowly carved and shaped
them, letting them reveal their true luster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than three years passed. It was the height of summer now. This
year, Ning turned twenty years old.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_6___Three_Years_Later"></A>
Chapter 6 - Three Years Later
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This midsummer dawn was
uncommonly cool. Ji Ning, still clad in his black furs, walked out
from the estate atop Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Meng Roch, who had grown only more
muscular and tanned, immediately greeted him with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky, prepare some
food for me. Same as what we’ve done in the past.” Ning laughed
as he gave some instructions. In the past three years, Northmont
Baiwei had delivered two more retainers, and so he now had a total of
six under his control. He was now quite familiar with all six of
them, but he still trusted Roch the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Roch had
damaged his ki foundation in the past, upon entering the Black-White
College, he began to train as a Fiendgod as well, and his skin had
darkened as a result. “Yes, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,”
Roch said, immediately departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you came out.” A beautiful figure
walked over from afar. It was Cloudjade. Behind her was a black-robed
youth; this was one of the six retainers under Ning’s command,
Weifang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade’s eyes were
as bright as jewels. After having been in the Black-White College for
so long, her aura had improved as well, and she now had an additional
hint of otherworldliness about her. “You were in closed-door
meditation for so long this time, senior apprentice-brother. It was
almost a month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stared at Ning with
a gaze that was quite scorching. Although her horizons had been
expanded during her time at the Black-White College…in her eyes, Ji
Ning was still the most brilliant star of them all. Three years had
passed, and compared to three years ago, Ning’s aura had only grown
more simple and pure; he was like a youth who lived a rustic life in
the mountain wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Cloudjade
understood that her senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning was now far
more powerful than he had been three years ago. There were now
extremely few people who were willing to engage in a discourse on the
Dao with Ning at the Dao Debate Palace, and quite a few secretly
claimed that Ning must surely be a reincarnated Immortal. From this,
one could tell how monstrous Ning’s performance had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time I come out
of seclusion, I’ll see you,” Ning laughed. “Cloudjade, you need
to calm your heart and focus on training as well. Look at Weifang..he
arrived after you did, but he’s the most powerful of the six of
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you praise me over-much,” the black-robed
youth, Weifang, immediately said with respect. “Compared to you,
senior apprentice-brother, I am countless tens of thousands of
kilometers beneath you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
worked quite hard,” Cloudjade said. But Ning only shook his head.
“Your talent is excellent, but your Dao-heart is somewhat lacking.”
Cloudjade just rolled her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly shook his
head. When Cloudjade had first joined the school, she had wanted to
seduce him. After realizing that there was no hope…although she was
still very respectful to Ning, she started to begin to work on
seducing the other senior apprentice-brothers of the College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She walks the path
of Immortal cultivation, but instead of calming her mind and focusing
on training, the only thing on her mind is becoming Dao-Companions
with powerful Immortal practitioners. Jeeze!” Ning felt quite
resigned about this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood
everything quite clearly. Cloudjade, by nature, wasn’t a bad
person. Of his six main retainers, the person Ning trusted the most
was Roch, and the person he trusted the second most was Cloudjade. As
for the other four, although they were extremely respectful towards
him, Ning could sense that all four of them were hugely ambitious,
and so he had to be careful in the amount of trust he showed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there, sipping
some stewed rice porridge that contained natural elemental energies
within it while eating some delicacies. His mood was quite good to
begin with, and it was improving further and further. Next to him was
the Whitewater Hound who just lay there, looking at Ning. He sent
mentally to Ning, “Ning, son; you seem to be in quite a good mood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I was in
closed-door training for nearly a month, but I’ve finally
comprehended the second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]!” Ning
looked at his Uncle White, his face covered in smiles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve
comprehended it?” The Whitewater Hound instantly revealed a look of
surprise and delight as well. Over the past three years…Ning had an
Immortal guiding him, the sword arts manuals of the Dao Repository
Vault to peruse over, and the complete [Three-Foot Sword] in his
mind, as well as the sword-intent which senior Northwalker had
transmitted to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s rate of
improvement had naturally been astonishingly fast. In the past, he
had never had a truly formidable teacher. Even his father and the
others, when faced with Ning’s monstrous talent, felt that they
were not quite good enough to teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Immortal Diancai
guiding Ning, Ning felt incomparable joy, and his rate of improvement
had reached an astonishing level. However, he had never been able to
completely comprehend the second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three years. You’ve
finally mastered it.” The Whitewater Hound rose to his feet,
feeling excited for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this sword art
mastered, I now have the confidence to go spar with Master once
again,” Ning said with a laugh. “Perhaps this time, Master will
acknowledge my growth and permit me to go out wandering.” Without
his master’s permission, Ning was not to leave the school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logically speaking,
given his current level of power, Ning should’ve been able to go
out wandering long ago. However, given how incredible Ning’s talent
was, Immortal Diancai’s requirements for Ning were similarly
incredible! By now…Ning had sparred against his master numerous
times, and although he had improved greatly each time, he had never
received his master’s permission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” the
Whitewater Hound mentally sent to him with a laugh. “If you go,
I’ll be able to accompany you in wandering. In the past, I went out
adventuring with your father as well. When I think about it, my blood
starts to pump.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By borrowing from
Ning’s liquefied elemental essence, the Whitewater Hound had
naturally reached the peak Zifu stage long ago. Ning had wanted to
trade for some powerful secret arts on behalf of the Whitewater
Hound, but the Whitewater Hound didn’t need it. All he accepted was
some formation techniques to analyze, which Ning had spent 200
black-white pellets on. Because it took quite a long period of time
to analyze formation techniques, the price of such techniques was
actually quite low. Ning had spent 600 black-white pellets for his
thirty-six sword arts manuals, but as for the formation manuals…he
had spent merely 200 black-white pellets for 91 books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nine Scrolls on
Formations] which that Loose Immortal had left behind was
incomparably broad and profound. This was the complete legacy of a
Loose Immortal. As a Godbeast, the Whitewater Hound had focused on
analyzing formations, even when he had been accompanying Ning’s
father. Acquiring the Nine Scrolls was already a case of him being
akin to a tiger who had gained wings. Now that he also gained so many
formations manuals from the Black-White College, he naturally had
made enormous improvements. And, every so often, the Whitewater Hound
would even go to the Black-White College to listen to some Primal
Daoists or even to some of the Immortals expound on the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go, then.”
Ning rose to his feet. “Go.” The Whitewater Hound watched as Ning
left. Ning boarded his flying boat, then quickly disappeared into the
distant horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
his boat in midair, staring downwards. Soon, he arrived at the
residence of his master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning landed in
front of the estate, and the gate guards smiled towards Ning. Ning
strode directly inwards without waiting. Immortal Diancai had given
the order long ago that Ning was to be permitted to enter directly,
without any need to report his arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall. The
black-haired, black-robed Immortal Diancai was seated in the lotus
position on his jade bed. It seemed as though the passage of three
years had not affected Ning’s master at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today is not the
first of the month. Have you come here to spar with me once more?”
Immortal Diancai looked at his beloved disciple. Over the course of
the past three years, he had come to love his sole disciple even
more, to the point where his affection for Ning was even greater than
his affection for the descendants of his clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning looked
at his master. A sword-light that seemed almost physical had appeared
within Ning’s eyes, and his entire person slowly began to radiate a
terrifying sword-intent. His sword-intent surged through the heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does seem that
you’ve improved a bit.” Immortal Diancai nodded. “Come, then.
Attack me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, Master.”
A Darknorth sword appeared out of nowhere, and he gripped it with two
hands. Swish! Ning transformed into a blurry, rapidly moving figure,
and the sharp sword in his hand seemed to have turned into a ghostly
image. His speed had reached an extremely high level, and he
instantly pierced the sword towards Immortal Diancai, seated on the
jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai,
seated on the jade bed, leisurely stretched out his fingers, forming
a sword-finger. With a light tap, a streak of sword-light instantly
arced out. “Clash.” This solitary streak of sword-light
repeatedly clashed in mid-air multiple times with Ning’s
sword-shadow. Ning’s sword moved about like a ghost, but although
this solitary streak of sword-light was in an arc, it’s position
also fluctuated unpredictably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
sword-light changed, becoming domineering and tyrannical. Bang!
Instantly, the surrounding area was submerged into a sea of fire, and
Ning’s sword became one of the flames within it, incomparably
valiant as it chopped directly towards Immortal Diancai. This sword
attack of Ji Ning’s…had already vastly surpassed the
[Thunderflame Sword]’s level, and most likely even the person who
had originally developed the [Thunderflame Sword] was no match for
the current Ning in terms of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Extinguish.”
Immortal Diancai revealed a hint of a smile as well. With a gentle
tap of the fingers, a sword-light flew out from his fingertips which
instantly transformed into thousands of silken lines. These silken
lines criss-crossed each other, seeming to form a giant net. This
giant net of sword-light howled forward, quickly surrounding and
wrapping around Ning’s pyroclasm of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“‘Heartless
Waterflame’!” Ning revealed a smile as well. Instantly, the
surrounding area changed yet again. One side was filled with blazing
flames, while the other side was filled with boundless rainwater. In
one of Ning’s hands was a blazing sword of fire, while in the other
was a sword of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire figure
radiated an invincible aura as he charged directly towards that net
of sword-light, and the twin swords in his hands spun in a vortex
together as he did so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The
sword-lights of fire and water clashed head on with the net of
sword-light in a giant explosion…and both shattered apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This latest
‘Heartless Waterflame’ finally seems to have a bit of flavor to
it.” Immortal Diancai pointed with his sword-finger once more.
Swish! A sharp sword-light attacked with incomparably astonishing
speed towards Ning, while at the same time, Immortal Diancai pointed
again, and again…one streak of sword-light after another shot out,
all moving at incomprehensible speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, he was
defeated by this technique, and his body was filled with quite a few
bloody holes. I wonder if he’ll be able to block it this time.”
Immortal Diancai’s eyes were filled with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning no longer revealed
an incomparably relaxed smile on his face as he had before. Instead,
his eyes lit up, and he seemed to suddenly explode with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The twin swords in Ning’s hands began to move. Suddenly, in the
area around Ning, an enormous millstone of fire and water appeared.
Fire and water were contradictory, opposite types of elemental
energy, but they twisted past each other here to form this enormous
millstone. In the very center of the millstone, where the water and
fire clashed with each other, a terrifying wind force arose. This
tri-colored millstone revolved around Ning, and where Ning’s sword
light flashed past, an incomparably powerful wind arose as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast! Faster than fast!
Chop! Chop! Chop! Ning consecutively chopped and extinguished the
sword-lights created by his master’s finger-taps. The bedstone of
fire and water revolved around him, while the gale raged around his
body. Ning’s sword flashed out like lightning as well, each time
striking at the weaknesses on the side of those flashes of
sword-light, rather than taking them head out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster. Move a
little faster.” Immortal Diancai began to tap with his fingers even
faster, and the sword-light which appeared in the air grew
increasingly ferocious as they shot towards Ning. Ning, ensconced
within that giant millstone of fire and water, wielded his sword at
an inconceivably fast speed, and continued to chop apart and
extinguish those flashes of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then!”
Immortal Diancai gently flicked his fingers, and the thousand rays of
sword-light that were in midair suddenly seemed to transform into
brilliant stars. They resonated amongst each other, thundering forth
with a unified attack that blasted towards Ning at the same time.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 7 - Master and Disciple, Pre-Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Last
time, when Ji Ning had sparred with his master, his master hadn’t
used this technique. Faced with the sudden attack of a thousand
star-like bursts of sword-light, Ning knew that his ‘Tripartite
Millstone’ wouldn’t be able to withstand the assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-intent
radiating from Ning’s body compressed itself to the utmost.
“Pierce!” Ning’s sword suddenly shout out. It was as though
even if there were infinitely great impediments standing in front of
Ning and wrapping around him, as though ropes were bound about him,
causing his sword to frantically struggle to pierce forward. It moved
incomparably slowly…and yet, in reality, that was just a
misperception, as the sword itself had reached an incredibly great
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The sword shot
out like a meteor! It tore through the boundless darkness, ripped
through all impediments, and completely shattered the thousand-plus
bolts of starry sword-light. With part of it having been destroyed,
all the surrounding bolts of starry sword-light vanished and
dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning himself,
moving like a phantom, he charged towards his master, the sword in
his right hand having stabbed forward and broken those thousand stars
of sword-light. At the same time, the sword in his left hand had
already stabbed towards his master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Immortal
Diancai revealed a smile as he rapped out this word. A formless sword
energy instantly clashed with Ning’s Darknorth sword. It was not
only powerful, but backed with a seemingly endless momentum of
energy, causing Ning to be pushed back many meters before finding his
footing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai, still
seated on his jade bed, nodded slowly. “The ‘Manifold
Thistlethorns’. You’ve finally comprehended this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the attack
Ning had just demonstrated, the second stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword] - ‘Manifold Thistlethorns’. This technique represented the
highest level of comprehension regarding the Dao of the Sword which
Ning had ever reached. “Thanks to your guidance, Master,” Ning
said respectfully, “Your foolish disciple was able to finally
comprehend this technique today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha. You only
spend three years to comprehend the second stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword]. If this performance of yours is to be described as ‘foolish’,
then your master would have to be described with the word ‘idiot’,”
Immortal Diancai laughed. “After I comprehended the first stance,
it took me ten years before I comprehended the second one. Your
talent is, indeed, far superior to mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
“My talent is at most comparable to those reincarnated Immortals.
Our Black-White College has had reincarnated Immortals in every
generation, and even in the current Black-White College, there are
several reincarnated Immortals. You, Master, despite not being a
reincarnated Immortal, are able to surprass those who are in power,
and are universally acknowledged as being the Immortal with the
greatest chances of becoming a Celestial Immortal. Similarly, the
Sloppy Daoist is also the undisputed number one figure amongst the
third generation disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
in satisfaction. “It is good that you are always humble and
vigilant. Now…you can leave the school and go out wandering.”
Immortal Diancai smiled as he looked at Ning. Finally, he had said
these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can go out
adventuring now?” Ning couldn’t help but feel excitement in his
heart. Each time he had made a breakthrough, he felt that he should
be able to receive his master’s acknowledgment, but in reality…he
had been disappointed time and time again. For example, when he had
reached the Dao Domain level in the ‘Dao of the Inferno’, or when
he had developed increasingly powerful sword arts, including his own
perfected and highly suitable ‘Tripartite Millstone Sword’
attack, he had felt incomparably proud and vigorous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, his master had
not nodded in approval. Not until today! After he had mastered the
second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], he had finally gained his
master’s acknowledgment. Finally, he was going to be able to wander
the outside world, filled with both dangers and opportunities. The
vast, endless outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Immortal
Diancai looked at Ning. “Master.” Ning tamped down the excitement
in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Accept these two
protective items.” Two items appeared out of nowhere in Immortal
Diancai’s hands. One appeared to be a brooch which was covered with
carvings that appeared to be of a beautiful Immortal palace. As for
the other, it was a fiery red jade bottle. “This pendant is
something I personally created. After refining it, carry it with you
at all times. With but a thought, you can release the sword-energy
within it to protect yourself. With that sword-energy protecting
you…you will be able to resist the attack of even a Loose Immortal
or an Earth Immortal for one breath’s worth of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for this jade
bottle…you must be extremely careful within it. Within it there is
a single ‘Polar Aurora Thunderflame Pearl’. It’s power is
tremendous. Once you throw it out, it does not distinguish between
friend or foe. Everything within a radius of thirty meters will be
reduced into powder. Even Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals will
most likely be heavily wounded, while almost all Primal Daoists will
perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of these two items,
one is meant for offense, while the other is meant for defense.
However, each can only be used a single time. Thus, you must consider
carefully when to use them.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning, his
eyes filled with anticipation and solemnity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went,
when a child travelled a thousand kilometers away, the parents would
be filled with worry. He only had a single disciple under his
tutelage, and this disciple was about to go adventuring in distant
lands…as his master, how could Immortal Diancai not be worried?
After all, no matter how powerful a peerless genius was, if he didn’t
have the chance to grow in power, he still wouldn’t be able to
overcome some older, more powerful figures. For example, if Ning
encountered a Primal Daoist opponent, he would still be crushed
without being able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must remember to
be cautious in all matters. Think thrice before acting…but once you
decide, act decisively.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. Suddenly,
Ning felt an aching feeling in his heart. That look…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, when he
had left West Prefecture City to go adventuring, his father and his
mother had looked at him with those exact same eyes. Eyes filled with
worry, but also anticipation. Although his master was powerful, he
couldn’t take on all the risks of life for his disciple. Every
disciple needed to truly test themselves…only then would they be
successful.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. Your disciple will definitely be careful,” Ning said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only things
which Master can give you are these two items.” Immortal Diancai
looked towards Ning. “Remember. Everything else will be up to your
own efforts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
accepted the items respectfully. These two items were both truly
priceless items; in fact, they vastly outstripped the value of the
presents which Northmont Blacktiger had given.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The defensive pendant
was able to defend against the attack of an Earth Immortal or Loose
Immortal for a full breath’s worth of time. In a life-and-death
attack, death would sometimes come in an instant. To Immortal
practitioners, the amount of time one needed to take a breath was
enough for them to fly countless kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Polaris
Aurora Thunderflame Pearl, it could badly injure Immortals and kill
almost all Primal Daoists. It could be described as a true killer
item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When next you return
to the College, come seek me out. You can go now.” Immortal Diancai
waved his hand as he spoke, then closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
bowed, then immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving his
master, Ning boarded his flying boat and flew into the skies. He felt
an aching feeling in his heart. He could sense that his master’s
heart was filled with concern for him, and that concern was not
unreasonable; the path of an Immortal practitioner was a path which
was against the heavens, a path that was filled with pitfalls. Even
the heavens themselves would, intentionally or unintentionally,
create numerous traps and barriers for Immortal practitioners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far too many disciples
of the Black-White College had died in the outside world. It must be
understood…so long as the disciples of the Black-White College did
not perish, the vast majority would become Primal Daoists! But there
were hundreds of third generation disciples, while only thirty or so
second generation Primal Daoists. Why? The reason was…the rest
died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They died while testing
themselves, while roaming the outside world! As the saying goes, if
jade isn’t polished, it cannot be carved, but during the carving
process, how many pieces of unpolished jade would end up being
destroyed? The ‘jade-carving knife’ of the ‘tempering’
process was truly a vicious one. To embark on the path of
Immortals…this was embarking on a path that was filled with
countless pitfalls and snares.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master. I will
definitely return to you alive,” Ning murmured in his heart. And
then, his flying boat went directly to the residence of his junior
apprentice-brother, the mountain peak of Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twinwood Peak. Ning
flew into the air above it, then called out directly, “Junior
apprentice-brother Northson.” His voice echoed out in waves,
reaching the estate below. Soon, a figure appeared in the courtyard
below, who quickly called back, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,
quick, come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning descended to the
ground. Compared to three years ago, although Northson still had the
appearance of a immature youth, in terms of both power and Dao-heart,
he had grown considerably. After all, he had been able to join the
Black-White College at the age of fourteen, and had been able to
spend so much time in meditation in front of the Black-White
Diagram…his talent was, without question, extremely high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he had
lost at the Dao Debates was because he was simply too young, and
because he hadn’t had as great a stroke of karmic luck as Ning had,
who had acquired the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, why did you decide to come here to my
place?” Northson laughed. “Normally, it’s quite rare to see you
come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was just approved
by master to go out adventuring in the outside world.” Ning
revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really? Wonderful!”
Northson instantly began to celebrate. “I’ve waited for this day
for over a year now. Two years after I joined, my master gave me
permission to go out adventuring. You are so strong, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, but you spent three years in training.
Immortal Diancai really is extremely exacting towards you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. After
receiving the nod from his master, Daoist Jadefine, Northson had
immediately come to find Ning. But Ning hadn’t been able to
leave…and so Northson had tamped down his impatience. He didn’t
want to go out wandering all by his lonely self; he wanted a
companion. If two brothers went out adventuring together, at least
they wouldn’t be too lonely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, he had
waited…all the way until today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, oh, I need to go
to my master and bid her farewell,” Northson said hurriedly. “Go,
go,” Ning said. “Your master dotes on you so much, you really
should have a good chat with her before leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The master of Northson,
Daoist Jadefine, did indeed dote on him. First of all, the entire
Black-White College had very, very few people who focused on the Dao
of Constructs; it was rare for her to find such a wonderful disciple.
And secondly, Daoist Jadefine had been stuck at the Primal Daoist
level for many years. The assaults of the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations had grown increasingly difficult for her to withstand,
and she was close to her limit. A person close to the end of her
years, upon suddenly taking on such a talented disciple who was so
young…Daoist Jadefine naturally doted fiercely on this disciple of
hers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he had entered
her tutelage, Daoist Jadefine had given Northson five hundred
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Thus, Northson had, at one
go, trained all the way to the middle Wanxiang stage. Even in the
Black-White College, this was incredibly rare!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The unspoken rule of
the Black-White College was that masters would not give their
disciples too many treasures; instead, they would provide guidance to
them. The College would place those special Ki Refining techniques
and divine abilities in the vault, and as the disciples rose in
power, for example reaching the ‘Dao Domain’ level, they would
then be able to go acquire those techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though a mountain
of gold or a silver was right there in front of them, the disciples
were to go dig for them themselves. Only then would they acquire
them. Divine abilities, secret arts; they were all there. However,
had to train in earnest and make improvements before acquiring them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one didn’t have to
work hard and didn’t make any improvements, and yet still received
everything one wanted? This would result in a useless, hedonistic son
of rich parents. Thus, the unspoken rule.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A master could help,
could guide, could lead by the hand. But the disciple had to go out
and struggle for himself! It was extremely rare for someone like
Daoist Jadefine to give five hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence to a disciple. However, that was also the limit of Daoist
Jadefine’s doting on Northson; in other aspects, such as in handing
out black-white pellets, she didn’t wantonly give him things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded. “Senior apprentice-brother, go back to your own place for
now. I’ll go visit Master, then make some preparations…tomorrow,
I’ll come seek you out, senior apprentice-brother. We’ll head out
tomorrow morning and leave the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. Northson immediately produced the Azure Dragon construct out
of nowhere. Boarding it, he rapidly soared into the skies and
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson has gone to visit his master.” Ning
boarded his own flying boat, soaring into the skies. As he did so, he
turned to glance towards Immortal Diancai’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master. Your
disciple definitely will not let you down.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 - Entering the Raindragon Guard
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next morning, at
dawn. Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, I want to go alongside with you. I can
pour tea for you and service you.” Cloudjade looked expectantly at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are going out in
the world to adventure and to test ourselves. There will be countless
dangers. This isn’t tourism! You had best just stay here calmly at
the Black-White College.” Ning looked towards his retainers; Meng
Roch, Cloudjade, Cloudship, Forgard, Weifang, and Nethersun. “After
I leave the Black-White College, all matters here at Darknorth Peak,
great and small, will be managed by Meng Roch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudship and the
others, upon hearing this, were all rather amazed. Roch? The weakest
amongst them was most likely Roch. The others had all improved in
strength, but because Roch’s ki foundation had been damaged, he had
been forced to divide his attention and also train as a Fiendgod. For
now, at least, he was the weakest of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Cloudjade and the others all
acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky. I entrust
Darknorth Peak to you.” Ning looked towards Roch. The tall, swarthy
Roch nodded solemnly. “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, don’t
worry at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly raised
his head. From afar, a streak of light was flying over. It was Mu
Northson, riding on his Azure Dragon construct. Northson called out
towards him from afar, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, Uncle
White.” The flying boat appeared next to Ning, and the Whitewater
Hound ambled into the boat. The two of them, a man and a large, snowy
white hound, immediately soared into the air, moving to join with the
distant Northson, aboard his flying dragon. Soon, they all
disappeared into the distant mountain peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and the
Whitewater Hound walked out from the main gates of the Black-White
College. “The next time we return,” Northson said, “We will be
even more powerful.” Northson turned to look at the gates of the
school, his eyes filled with anticipation and desire. He said softly,
“And I’m going to bring back a pile of techniques and arts which
the College doesn’t have…I’ve grown sick of not having enough
black-white pellets, and of the pain of not having enough of them to
trade for all sorts of golem-related arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had a sea of techniques and arts; where did they all come from?
Naturally, they had been accumulated over the years by its disciples,
who had brought them back after adventuring in the outside world.
When the disciples offered new techniques and arts, they would
receive corresponding rewards in black-white pellets and liquefied
elemental essence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning actually had two
extremely powerful techniques which he could offer to the College;
the first was his divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion], while the
second was the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. The entire school
only had five divine abilities; from this, one could see how rare
they were. This divine ability, however, had been passed down from
generation to generation by the Yuchi clan, and even his mother had
told him that it was not to be given to outsiders. How could he so
casually give it up?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], that was something he could make his own
decision on, but he had already left the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] to the Ji clan; in the future, the Ji clan would rely on
it to rise to prominence. His father had given his entire life for
the Ji clan, and Ning had grown up within the clan ever since he was
young. He felt a powerful sense of loyalty to the clan. For now, Ning
still needed to seriously consider as to whether or not he was to
give such a powerful, consummate technique to the College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, all schools,
sects, tribes, and clans viewed arts and techniques with great
importance. It was entirely possible that an entire tribe might be
exterminated for the sake of a divine ability or a powerful secret
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where should we go?”
Northson asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain.” Ning laughed. “The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain has countless treasures within it. If we are going
to go adventuring, we’ll need to prepare ourselves. We can go
shopping there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I really do
want to go shopping.” Northson nodded. And so, Ning, Northson, and
the Whitewater Hound immediately departed the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-haired,
young-faced old granny was standing within a courtyard. The
water-scrying mirror in front of her revealed Ning, Northson, and the
Whitewater Hound departing from the gates of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northson…”
Daoist Jadefine’s eyes held a hint of both worry and anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired Immortal Diancai was seated in the lotus position on his
bed. Suddenly, he opened his eyes. They were filled with
anticipation. His disciple had gone out to temper himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some disciples would
return in two or three years. Some would only return after decades.
Still others would return only after centuries! But of course, there
were also some who would never return, having died in the outside
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. This place had the support of the mighty imperial clan of
the Xia Dynasty. They were in every single one of the commandery
cities which were stretched across the vast land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the three years
since joining the Black-White College, Ning had come out and met with
Northmont Baiwei quite a few times. Naturally, he had gone to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, this
time when we go adventuring, we shall be beset by dangers. What do
you need?” Ning looked towards the Whitewater Hound by his side and
spoke to him mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
given me that Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal,” the Whitewater Hound
sent back mentally. “Right now, there is one thing which I wish for
the most…the ‘Fuxi Staff Formation’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi Staff
Formation?” Ning nodded. Although he couldn’t compare with his
Uncle White in terms of formations, in his spare time, Ning would
also go meditate on them. Naturally, he knew about the renowned ‘Fuxi
Staff Formation’. Fuxi…that was a major power from the legends.
Even in his previous life on Earth, Ning had heard some of the
legends of Fuxi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi, Houyi,
Kuafu…these were all figures out of ancient legends. The Fuxi Staff
Formation, in turn, was supposedly created by Fuxi, formed from eight
arrays of eight staffs, for 64 staffs in total. Fuxi was able to use
it to execute all sorts of formations. Those 64 staffs…there were
boundless ways in which they could be used. In the hands of an
ordinary Immortal cultivator, they might be useless, but in the hands
of a formations expert, they could unleash astonishing levels of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher one’s
level of insights into formations was, the greater and the more
miraculous the power one would be able to unleash from the Fuxi Staff
Formation. According to legends, Fuxi was able to rely on this Fuxi
Staff Formation to set up a grand formation that had the power to
annihilate the heavens and exterminate the earth. In addition, the
Fuxi Staff Formation was something which could be carried about; like
the ‘Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation’, it could be
unleashed at any time. Thus, those who were skilled in formations
would generally try to procure a set of the Fuxi Staff Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Leave it to
me.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji.
Young master Mu.” A devilishly attractive female Zifu Disciple had
come to the gates of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain early on, and
she now came to welcome them. Ning, Northson, and the Whitewater
Hound thus entered the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were countless
treasures within the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, but the prices were
similarly extravagant. Still, those who the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain cared about would generally be given discounts. For genius
disciples of the Black-White College, a 30% discount would be given.
This was essentially as large a discount as was possible, because
when the Heavenly Treasures Mountain purchased treasures, they would
usually buy them at a 60% valuation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were stories of some Immortals who both bought and sold items at a
cost of 60%; the Heavenly Treasures Mountain wouldn’t try to make
any money off them at all. But of course, for now, Ning’s group
couldn’t possibly be treated in this way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m selling this
set of sword formations. This magic treasure as well. Oh, this set of
sword formations as well.” Within the Heavenly Treasures Mountain,
Ning quickly began to sell off the many magic treasures he had
accumulated, such as the various magic treasures he had acquired when
killing the Immortal cultivators of Snowdragon Mountain. He had even
sold off the sword formations bestowed upon him by Northmont
Blacktiger and senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow. This was
because, although these sword formations were of high quality, they
came from different sources; some were ice-attribute flying swords,
while others were fire-attribute flying swords. Having too many
swords of different types was not beneficial to the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, an hour had
passed. Ning, Northson, and the Whitewater Hound all departed from
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning acquired a set of
360 high-grade Mortal-ranked water-attribute flying swords, then
acquired another set of 360 high-grade Mortal-ranked fire-attribute
flying swords. In total, he had 720 high-grade flying swords now.
Although these were all produced by the Heavenly Treasures Mountain,
and were flying swords of the most common variety, with nothing
unique about them, they were still high-grade Mortal-ranked weapons.
If he had to use liquefied elemental essence to purchase them, he
would have spent nearly five hundred kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger had gifted
him two sword formations, while Bloodshadow had gifted him with one.
He had managed to sell them off for nearly 450 kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence. The magic treasures of Adept Xu Li, in turn, were
sold off for nearly fifty kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, in the end,
Ning ended up paying an additional hundred kilograms in exchange for
720 high-grade Mortal-ranked flying swords, and a Fuxi Staff
Formation. He then spent a bit more to purchase some necessary
adventuring items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh!” After
exiting the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, Northson let out a sigh.
“After entering the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, I realized how
poor I actually am. All I have left right now is around five
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence or so. As for you, senior
apprentice-brother, I imagine you should be a bit better off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past three
years, although I’ve won a few battles at the Dao Debate Palace…”
Ning shook his head. “After this visit to the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain, I’m essentially bankrupt as well. I only have around
fifty or so kilograms left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson nodded, but
then his eyes lit up. “Of course we won’t be able to acquire any
treasures while staying within the College all the time. We are now
going to go out adventuring, and we’ll have plenty of opportunities
to acquire them. For example, back in the day, senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow managed to effortlessly gift you that
precious Mortal-ranked sword formation to you, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning. Clearly, to him, it wasn’t worth
anything at all. Now that we are going out adventuring, I trust that
soon, we’ll be just like him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
eyes were filled with eagerness as well. In the College, they would
often hear about how this senior apprentice-brother found a senior’s
legacy and acquired some precious item, or about how that senior
apprentice-sister had killed hundreds of other Immortal practitioners
over ten-plus years of wandering and battling, and had acquired
countless treasures. Or…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Well. In short, Ning
and Northson had never been out adventuring, and so they naturally
felt itchiness in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, I traded
for some treasures. My power has improved a bit, compared to the
past. This time, I’m definitely going to go on a rampage around the
world.” Northson was filled with a boundless heroic aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Ning just
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] still had, as its core, the Nine Yang Swords
Formation which he had acquired in the underwater estate. The other
360 water-attribute flying swords and 360 fire-attribute flying
swords…they both countered and reinforced each other, and extremely
well-suited for controlling within the Dao of formations. Ning
trusted that his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would also have
incomparably astonishing combat power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My long-distance
attacks are now comparable to my close-quarters attacks,” Ning
mused to himself. Ning was now extremely powerful in close combat,
because he had reached the ninth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens], which was comparable to an ordinary early stage
Wanxiang Adept Fiendgod! In addition, after he had reached the Dao
Domain level in the Dao of the Inferno and gained a thousand
black-white pellets, Ning had purchased both the divine ability
[Heavenly Transformation] as well as the second scroll of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, even if he didn’t
use the utterly monstrous [Starseizing Hand] ability, just by relying
on his [Windwing Evasion] and [Heavenly Transformation] divine
abilities, Ning could unleash a truly astonishing amount of power in
close combat. In addition, as a Ki Refiner, he had the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], and so he was also extremely strong. Both
in close quarters and at long range…he was extremely powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, where should we go?” Northson looked at
the nearby Ning. “Where should we go adventure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, our
senior fellow disciples all recommended that we go join the
Raindragon Guard,” Ning said. “There are many benefits for
someone to join the Raindragon Guard, and we can also take on
missions from them, and so have fixed goals when we go out
adventuring. In addition, as Raindragon Guards who are out on
official missions…we can also overawe and frighten off some people,
and also avoid some difficulties.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded. “I was thinking the same thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two finished their
discussion, and their decision was…to first join the Raindragon
Guard!
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_9___Raindragon_Guard__St"></A>
Chapter 9 - Raindragon Guard, Stillwater Division
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, before
leaving, paid a visit to Northmont Blacktiger’s Estate as well. He
bade farewell to his good friend, Northmont Baiwei, who upon learning
that Ning was leaving, gave him quite a few pieces of advice. He knew
exactly how dangerous adventuring in the outside world was, but in
order to become a truly influential, powerful figure in the greater
world, one did have to undergo a brutal, merciless tempering process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a desolate, wild
region outside Stillwater City. “Kakakaka…crunch.” An Azure
Dragon construct, hovering in midair, suddenly transformed, its body
beginning to change into the shape of a wide, dragon-headed ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
staring at the dragon-headed ship, then gave a surprised sigh and
glanced towards the nearby Mu Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother
Northson, this construct of yours can even transform? How
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are an outsider
who knows nothing at all about the art of constructs. Transformations
are nothing more than parlour tricks,” Northson said smugly. “Let’s
go. The Stillwater division of the Raindragon Guard is located at the
Crimson Dragon Mountains. Although it’s a bit far from here…flying
on magic treasures isn’t quite as comfortable as letting the
construct fly for us on its own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning led the
Whitewater Hound in boarding the dragon-headed ship. Standing atop
the front of the ship, Northson had an incomparably bold appearance,
and the ship quickly soared into the clouds, moving at high speed.
Northson said, “I have an essence-gathering runic formation placed
atop this construct, and so when flying at this speed, it won’t use
up any elemental energy at all. The elemental essence it absorbs
while flying will be enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I often heard
aunt-master Jadefine praise you and say that your talents in the Dao
of Constructs are extremely high. In the College, we would at most
engage in Dao Debates, and so I’ve never had the chance to
personally witness your power in this regard, junior
apprentice-brother Northson. Now that we are joining the Raindragon
Guard…I’ll be able to take a good look,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make sure you watch
with wide eyes.” Northson raised his head proudly, seeming quite
delighted with himself. Ning roared with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
gotten to know quite a few senior fellow apprentices during the past
three years at the Black-White College, and they were on very good
terms with some, such as Ninelotus and Bloodshadow, in Ning’s
heart, the one he was closest to was still Mu Northson, who had
joined the school alongside him. Northson, perhaps because of his
young age, had completely focused on the Dao of Constructs since he
was a child, and unlike Ning, didn’t have memories from a former
life. Thus, his behavior was quite juvenile and immature. In short;
Northson had the temperament of a child!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he liked something,
he liked it; if he was mad, he was mad. He wasn’t able to hide
anything! When he first entered the school, he had been defeated
twice in Dao Debates, and had been unspeakably angry. If he had been
slightly better at hiding his emotions, he wouldn’t have exposed
his anger so openly. Strictly speaking…he was a bit too earnest and
sincere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In turn, however, Ning
found it quite easy to get along with a little junior
apprentice-brother like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There we are. We
reached the Crimson Dragon Mountains.” Northson’s eyes were
gleaming as he pointed into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared into the
distance. Past the clouds, he could see a chain of mountains that did
indeed seem to be shaped into the sinuous figure of a dragon. The
entire dragon-shaped mountain range was covered with a fiery red
color, and from the distance, it did indeed look like a fiery, divine
dragon! Its aura was quite astonishing as well, and in fact, it was
even more terrifying than the grand formation of the Black-White
College, which had been reinforced by countless generations of
Immortals of the College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It lives up to its
reputation as one of the top two supreme powers within Stillwatery
Commandery,” Ning said with an amazed sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson sighed in
amazement as well. “The two supreme powers are the Northmont clan
of Stillwater, and the Stillwater division of the Raindragon Guard.
In addition, just from looking at the grand formation, we can see
that they definitely far surpass our Black-White College. The
Raindragon Guard really live up to their reputation. This was just a
mere commandery division! When you think about how there is such a
division in every single commandery which has been united under the
control of the Xia Dynasty…one can’t help but shudder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “This is
true.” The Northmont clan of Stillwater Commandery held, as their
enfeoffment, the entire Stillwater Commandery. They had existed from
the Fiendgod era; naturally, they had accumulated countless valiant
powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Raindragon
Guard? One could see from a superficial look as to how powerful they
are. In addition, they could ask for the support of the other
divisions at any time, and could even request support from the
headquarters of the Raindragon Guard in the imperial capital of the
Xia Dynasty! To the Raindragon Guard which oversaw the entire Xia
Dynasty, sending out a few hundred or even a thousand Immortals was a
minor matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s precisely
because they are so powerful, being representatives of the Xia
Dynasty, that even we desire to join the Raindragon Guard,” Ning
said. “Come. Let’s move over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded. The dragon-headed boat immediately swooped lower, moving
directly towards the Crimson Dragon Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimson Dragon
Mountains were shaped like an enormous dragon, with the head of the
dragon being the mountain where guests were welcomed. Ning and
Northson directed the construct vessel to swoop downwards, landing
directly atop a flat area at the guest-welcoming mountain. After
collecting the Azure Dragon construct, Ning, the Whitewater Hound,
and Northson all moved over. Right at this moment, two Zifu Disciples
who wore fiery red armor walked over from afar. A cold look on their
faces, they barked, “Why have you come to our Crimson Dragon
Mountains?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson both
felt as though they were being rather overbearing, but this was the
local division of the Raindragon Guard, after all. The two of them
couldn’t act too inappropriately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have come to join
the Raindragon Guard,” Ning said. “Oh?” The two fiery-armored
Zifu Disciples gave them a glance, and the leader, a tall, skinny
cultivator, said in a cold voice, “Then follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and the
Whitewater Hound immediately followed after him. They all moved
through the mountainous as easily as though they were moving through
flat land, and these crimson-armored Zifu Disciples could be seen
throughout this guest-welcoming peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
listen up.” The tall, skinny cultivator leading to them said in a
cold voice, “Quite a few wish to join our Raindragon Guard.
However, you have not yet joined and are not yet Raindragon Guards.
And so, you’d best obediently obey the rules here…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, upon hearing
this, frowned. Ning, however, was more or less calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember this. First
of all, you are not Raindragon Guards; thus, within the Crimson
Dragon Mountains, you are forbidden from fighting. If you violate
this, you will be killed with no mercy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second, the only
place within the Crimson Dragon Mountains which you may move about in
is this place, the guest-welcoming mountain. If you barge into other
areas, you will be killed with no mercy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third, you are not
to touch or damage the restrictive formations set upon the
guest-welcoming mouontain. Violators will be killed with no mercy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, skinny man
didn’t even look at Ning or Northson. Northson’s face was now
turning rather ugly. He sent mentally, “Junior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning, the Raindragon Guard have too many rules, and they are too
brash and arrogant. We are disciples of the Black-White College, and
yet they treat us like this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about being
disciples of the Black-White College; even if we were members of the
Northmont clan of Stillwater, it wouldn’t mean anything in this
place.” Ning had read the intelligence reports, and knew a few
things about the Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and the
Whitewater Hound continued to follow from behind. Soon, they arrived
at the back of the mountain, where there were wooden houses and stone
houses scattered everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look.” The
tall, skinny cultivator pointed towards the distant stone and wood
houses. “Within those houses are those who wish to join the
Raindragon Guard. These houses were built and left behind by others
who came to join us. You can choose an empty one and live there for
now. When we’ve cobbled together enough people, you’ll be sent to
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
tall, skinny cultivator turned and departed, quickly disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who the hell is he?
He’s so arrogant,” Northson muttered. “He’s an auxiliary
‘Keeper’ of the Raindragon Guard,” Ning said. He had met with
Baiwei quite a few times, and had learned many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A ‘Keeper’ of
the Raindragon Guard?” Northson said, surprised, “The Raindragon
Guard actually has Keepers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Of
course. Those of us who join the Raindragon Guard are all quite free
and unrestrained; we roam about the world, and only when we come to
take on missions will we appear! However, the Raindragon Guard also
needs some people who are permanently stationed here, or some
soldiers who they will be able to trust completely. Thus, the
‘Keepers’ were created!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Keepers of the
Raindragon Guard are like soldiers; they are controlled extremely
strictly, and are subject to many rules. They aren’t as free as
us,” Ning said. “You should know that the Raindragon Guard has an
auxiliary corps! Generally speaking, the Keepers are selected from
the auxiliary corps.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh!” Northson now
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although their
freedoms are restricted, they have the highest degree of trust from
the Xia Dynasty. Within the Raindragon Guard, they have access to
more divine abilities, secret arts, treasures, etc. As for us, even
after we become Raindragon Guards, we’ll still need to carry out
missions in order to receive such benefits,” Ning said. “To get
something, you have to give something.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson hurriedly
nodded. “I don’t want to become a Keeper. There are so many
rules; how does it even feel like being an Immortal practitioner?
That’s just a form of suffering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone has their
own choices,” Ning said with a laugh, then sighed. “Those who are
extremely talented will naturally have the option of choosing to be
free and unrestrained. But for those who are less talented, they
naturally might give up these things, so as to be able to acquire
some top-class techniques, secret arts, and whatnot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. That’s true as
well.” Northson nodded, seeming to have understood something. As
the two chatted, they continued to move forward. The stone and wooden
residences were all very simply made; generally speaking, they had
just a single house and a yard. A number of them already had Immortal
cultivators residing in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one.”
Northson pointed at a grassy area in front of him. As he pointed,
instantly, a streak of light flew out, and the streak of light
quickly began to transform and expand atop the ground, quickly
developing into quite an elegant-looking estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An estate made from
a construct?” Ning was startled. The Dao of Constructs truly was a
remarkable one. Carriages, warships, people, beasts, estates, or even
cities; all these things could be produced through the Dao of
Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who knows how long
this adventure of ours shall last? It’s quite unsafe to stay in an
empty, desolate area. Thus, I personally created this ‘Moonwood
Estate’, which even a Wanxiang Adept would need to spend quite a
bit of time to break into,” Northson said smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad, not bad,”
Ning laughed as he walked inside. And so, Ning, Northson, and the
Whitewater Hound took up residence within the ‘Moonwood Estate’.
One day after another passed, and the Immortal cultivators living in
the nearby stone and wood houses began to discover that a
construct-estate had appeared in their midst. However, none of them
commented on it, just waited quietly together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Early one dawn, a month
after Ning’s group had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone!” A
sonorous voice thundered out, instantly filling every single stone
room and even wooden room. Even the construct-estate which Northson
had created was unable to block out this sound, which blasted forth
next to Ning, Northson, and the Whitewater Hound’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to go to
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.” The voice continued to
echo forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his chest
grow tight, and his face changed. “Such terrifying power. This
level of power…makes me feel as though I cannot resist it
whatsoever. It must be an Immortal.” Although he didn’t feel
confident in being able to fight a Primal Daoist, he wouldn’t feel
as completely powerless as he did now. Thus, it should be an
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson both
walked out. Northson waved his hand, and the entire construct-estate
was tucked away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment in time,
figures emerged from the stone and wooden houses as well. These were
all people who wished to join the Raindragon Guard.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_10___The_Immortals_of_th"></A>
Chapter 10 - The Immortals of the Raindragon Guard
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at his
surroundings. During the past month, all of the Immortal cultivators
had remained in their own stone or wooden houses, training quietly.
To them…training and waiting for a month was a very simple matter.
Thus, during the past month, he hadn’t really gotten to know any of
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred!” Ning’s
gaze swept past them, and he realized that the total number of
figures who had emerged numbered exactly a hundred people. Ning then
turned his gaze to the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Up ahead, there were
three figures who were staring at Ning and the other 99 who wished to
join the Raindragon Guard. These three were led by a silver-haired,
black-robed elder who carried a desolate, killing aura about him.
When he swept his gaze past the prospective recruits, everyone, Ning
included, felt an invisible pressure bear down upon them. It was as
though a black dragon was staring at a crowd of ants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Immortal!” Ning
said silently to himself. The gaze of the silver-haired, black-robed
elder flashed like the gleam of a weapon, causing them all to feel
shock in their hearts. He suddenly spoke out. “Your batch of a
hundred Immortal cultivators has been completed. Now, you can go to
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the hundred all listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are not yet
Raindragon Guards,” the silver-haired, black-robed elder continued
coldly. “Thus, you were assigned to live in this desolate,
backwater part of the mountain. Once you become true Raindragon
Guards…you will naturally be permitted to enter the depths of the
Crimson Dragon Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he pointed
towards the distance, to a peak of the Crimson Dragon Moungains.
“That place is the place where true Raindragon Guards reside. The
Crimson Dragon Mountains aren’t a place for pleasure, and it isn’t
as bustling as Stillwater City. The only thing we have here is the
endless quiet.” The silver-haired elder continued calmly, “Those
who focus on training quietly will generally take over one of the
cave estates of the Crimson Dragon Mountains and train within. The
number of Immortals who are currently training within the Crimson
Dragon Mountains…is greater than twenty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once these words came
out, Ning and the rest of the hundred Immortal cultivators all felt
their hearts clench tightly. The Raindragon Guard really did live up
to its reputation as being one of the two titans of Stillwater
Commandery! More than twenty Immortals?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson were
from the Black-White College, which was ranked as the third greatest
power. And yet, they now understood what a tremendous difference in
power there was. Although the College had quite a few Immortals…just
the ones training in at the Raindragon Guard’s base numbered over
twenty, much less the ones out on assignment or in the other branches
spread throughout the Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In fact, some
Celestial Immortals will occasionally come from the imperial capital
to expound on the Dao for the Raindragon Guards present.” The
silver-haired elder swept his gaze forward. “In terms of power, our
division of the Raindragon Guard is comparable to the Northmont clan
of Stillwater. In terms of our roots and background, however, the
Raindragon Guard vastly outstrips them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as you can
enter the Raindragon Guard, divine abilities, secret arts, and even
the chance to head to the core of the Xia Dynasty, the imperial
capital…all these are possible. You might even have a chance to go
to the main headquarters of the Raindragon Guard to learn and be
trained.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of this…requires
you to first join the Raindragon Guard!” The silver-haired,
black-robed elder stood there, waist as straight as a mountain, his
voice reverberating sonorously in each person’s inner heart. “Now,
each of you shall tell me of your history and your power. If you wish
to join the Raindragon Guard…you must meet the minimum requirements
of our Raindragon Guard. If you aren’t even able to fulfill the
minimum requirements, then there is no need for you to go to the Gaol
Mountains’s wild marshes; you can just go back right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly, a
bronze mirror floated up into the skies, hanging there. “All of
you, fully explain your histories and your level of strength. If you
dare to lie at all, you will be killed without mercy. You.” The
silver-haired elder pointed towards a black-bearded youth, and the
bronze mirror turned towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-bearded youth
immediately said, “Skysplitter Sword Sect, Ki Refiner, middle-stage
Wanxiang Adept, Bu Violetsun!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
silver-haired elder nodded. “Next.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastriver Clan, Ki
Refiner. Late-stage Wanxiang Adept, Eastriver Cloudsoar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One practitioner after
another began to reveal their histories. The Raindragon Guard would
naturally want to learn about the backgrounds of those who came to
join. After learning their backgrounds and names…given the
intelligence networks of the Raindragon Guard, they would quickly be
able to obtain detailed reports.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single person
dared to lie. To lie in front of an Immortal of the Raindragon Guard
would be suicidal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” The
silver-haired elder pointed towards Northson. Northson answered,
“Black-White College, Ki Refiner. Middle-stage Wanxiang Adept, Mu
Northson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone from the
Black-White College came as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, quite a few
Immortal cultivators began to pay attention to Northson. Although
they also came from extremely top-tier schools, sects, and extremely
large clans that were on the same tier as the Black-White College,
those tribes and clans had many disciples and descendants. Every
single member of the Black-White College, however, was definitely a
peerless genius. Not a single one of them was easily offended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” The
silver-haired elder looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black-White College,
Ki and Fiendgod Body dual refiner. Ninth stage of the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Ji Ning.” Ning gave his response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired elder
gave Ning a surprised glance. For even an Immortal to be surprised,
the reactions of the other Immortal practitioners went without
saying. All of them were filled with boundless amazement and
curiousity. To join the Raindragon Guard…generally speaking, the
early Wanxiang Adept stage was a minimum requirement, but of course,
if one trained in the legendary, number one Fiendgod Body Refining
Technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], one would
be an exception. Being at the Zifu Disciple level would suffice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This situation,
however, was extremely rare. Unexpectedly, today they managed to
encounter someone who had trained to the ninth stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth stage of
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is comparable to an
ordinary early stage Fiendgod Wanxiang Adept. Upon using a divine
ability, the power will definitely be significant; after all, he came
from the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too rash. No
matter what, he’s only an early stage Wanxiang Adept. Since he
didn’t discuss his power as a Ki Refiner, he hasn’t reached the
Wanxiang level in it either. He’s a weak Ki Refiner, and just
barely qualifies as a Fiendgod Body Refiner…upon encountering a
group of enemies, they will trample him to death.” The Immortal
practitioners were all thinking this to themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who dared join
the Raindragon Guard were all quite self-confident, and could be
considered elites amongst their peers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…” The
silver-haired, black-robed elder looked towards Ning’s reflection
in the bronze mirror, then nodded slowly. “You are indeed at the
ninth stage. Next.” The silver-haired, black-robed elder looked
towards the next person. But, right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A voice suddenly echoed
in Ning’s mind. “Your name is Ji Ning? The [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens] has been publicly acclaimed since the Fiendgod
Era as the number one technique, and it has quite a few special
aspects. Once you join the Raindragon Guard, you’ll learn how to
better unleash your battle power as a Fiendgod. You must return from
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains alive…and actually, it’d
be better if you waited until you reached the tenth stage or the
eleventh stage before going to the wild marshes. Then, you will
definitely be incomparably safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired,
black-robed elder even gave Ning a sidelong glance. Ning
understood…this Immortal of the Raindragon Guard was the one who
had mentally sent him this message. Ning smiled towards this Immortal
of the Raindragon Guard, but he didn’t hesitate at all. Clearly,
his mind was set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Special?” Ning
pondered this statement. “When I was in the underwater estate, the
giant yellow bear also said that my Fiendgod body can be described as
‘perfect’, and capable of learning the [Starseizing Hand] which
Daoist Threelives left behind. In addition, even in the Fiendgod Era,
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was publicly
acclaimed as the number one Fiendgod Body Refining Technique. It has
spread so far…I imagine that it is quite easy to acquire. Even our
Ji clan has a complete copy of the first scroll and the first nine
stages of it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had the feeling…as
though there must be a tremendously powerful force which was
propagating the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. In
addition, this technique had been publicly acknowledged long ago. The
Xia Dynasty itself had only been established during the later periods
of the Fiendgod Era. This technique had existed even before the Xia
Dynasty’s founding…and yet, the Xia Dynasty actively propagated
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There must be some
reason for this,” Ning mused to himself. “However, without
question, this technique, as one which even the giant yellow bear
praised, shouldn’t have any problems. Since the technique itself
has no problems…then for now, a kid like myself has no need to
worry about the other reasons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Immortal of the
Raindragon Guard said that there are some special aspects to it, and
that after joining the Raindragon Guard, I’ll learn how to truly
unleash the combat potential of my divine body?” Ning instantly
grew rather eager. The Raindragon Guard was the most powerful
military force of the entire Xia Dynasty. It only made sense that it
had some special secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of its roots
and its background…the Raindragon Guard was naturally countless
times superior to the Black-White College. Not even the Marquis of
Stillwater could compare to the entire Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” The
silver-haired elder pointed to the final Immortal cultivator. This
man was dressed in a beautiful golden robe, and he said with respect,
“Snowdragon Mountain, Ki Refiner, peak Wanxiang Adept, Dong One!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ears twitched.
He turned to look over towards him, and that Immortal cultivator just
so happened to be looking at Ning as well. Their gazes intersected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He knows me.” Ning
instantly realized this, when their gazes cross. The Immortal
cultivator named Dong One had a smile on his face, and he even nodded
towards Ning. Ning just gave him a calm look, not smiling at all. His
parents and uncle, in a way, had all died due to the disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain. How could Ning possibly smile when facing a
disciple of Snowdragon Mountain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to ponder in
his heart. “Why has this Wanxiang Adept of Snowdragon Mountain come
here? Did he accidentally encounter me, or was he chasing after me
deliberately?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he had
remained in Stillwater City this entire time, and so Snowdragon
Mountain didn’t have any chance to take revenge on him. Was
Snowdragon Mountain pursuing him as soon as he had emerged?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their intelligence
networks shouldn’t be this good,” Ning mused. “In addition, I’m
a disciple of the Black-White College, and the personal disciple of
an Immortal. Snowdragon Mountain shouldn’t be so bold as to act in
this way. It’s possible that this is all just a chance meeting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each person had
finished describing their histories and strengths. The silver-haired,
black-robed elder waved his hand. Instantly, streaks of light flew
out towards each person. Ning stretched out his hand, clasping it; it
was a talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a talisman,”
the silver-haired, black-robed elder said. “Bind it. Only then will
you be able to enter the inner regions of the Crimson Dragon
Mountains. The teleportation array within the inner region leads to
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. If you haven’t bound any
talismans, the protective formation around the Crimson Dragon
Mountains will not permit you to enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
didn’t hesitate at all, as they all immediately bound the
talismans. “Go.” The silver-haired, black-robed elder’s body
suddenly became shrouded by clouds which appeared out of nowhere, and
the clouds lifted up and dragged Ning and the others away. However,
the spirit-beasts which some Immortal cultivators had brought were
all left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The test for
entering the Raindragon Guard is a personal test. These spirit-beasts
are not to enter the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains,” the
silver-haired, black-robed elder said. “Have them stay here for
now. If you come back alive, you can seek them out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the clouds. He turned to look downwards towards the Whitewater Hound.
“Uncle White, wait for me,” Ning sent mentally. “Be careful,”
the Whitewater Hound sent back, looking towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the
silver-haired, black-robed elder led the group of Immortal
cultivators atop his clouds. They quickly flew away, moving deeper
into the distant inner regions of the Crimson Dragon Mountains.
</P>

Chapter 11 - The Wild Marshes of the Gaol Mountains
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When standing atop the
clouds and staring downwards, one would be vaguely make out the
Immortal residences that lay scattered throughout the winding
mouontains. Occasionally, one would also seem some figures flying
about on magic treasures; most likely, those were Raindragon Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ji Ning and Mu
Northson were staring with curiosity towards those Immortal
cultivators, suddenly…the cloud began to sink downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…” Ning
saw, in the distance, a towering mountain peak, atop which a massive,
complicated, tower-shaped formation had been built.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The cloud landed,
and Ning’s group of Immortal cultivators stared towards the
tower-shaped formation. This tower-shaped formation up ahead faintly
glimmered with gray light, and it was 2400 meters high! The base had
a diameter of three hundred meters, and was divided into what
appeared to be nine halls. The entire tower-shaped formation’s
structure appeared to be made from rare metals, and it was covered
with the carvings of many runes. The densely clustered runes covered
the entire, 2400 meter high tower-shaped formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire tower-shaped
formation emanated a hazy gray light. Only the tip of the tower shone
with a white light. Next to the formation, there were ten old men
dressed in plain clothes who were on guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
teleportation array?” Northson’s eyes were shining. “Should
be,” Ning said, also incredibly curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had heard long ago
about the legendary ‘teleportation arrays’, but had never used
them. In Stillwater Commandery, only the Raindragon Guards, along
with a very few number of others, had the right to use the
teleportation array. But of course, one could bring one’s retainers
and spirit-beasts along. It was only because Ning’s group was here
to join the Raindragon Guard that an exception was made and they were
permitted to use it once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teleportation
array?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A teleportation
array that is 2400 meters high? The division stationed in my homeland
has a teleportation array as well, but it is only 300 meters high,
much smaller than this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never even
seen one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these Immortal
practitioners all had seen many things, upon seeing this massive
teleportation array, they all sighed in amazement. As for those ten
plainly dressed elders, upon they all bowed towards that
silver-haired, black-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations,” the silver-haired, black-robed elder instructed.
“These hundred Immortal cultivators are to be sent directly to the
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The ten
elders immediately entered the grand formation, which began to change
subtly. As for the silver-haired elder, he glanced towards Ning’s
group of a hundred, then said in a sonorous voice, “This
teleportation array is a top-tier teleportation array. It can even
teleport you directly to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia
Dynasty! You can reach any region of this vast world through this
teleportation array and arrive in an instant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains are two million kilometers away, you
will arrive in an instant,” the silver-haired, black-robed elder
said. “Eh?!” Suddenly, the silver-haired elder’s face changed
slightly. Swoosh! He suddenly disappeared fro the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This completely
astonished Ning and the others, who were still listening to him
speak. “Why did he vanish?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something important
must have occurred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortals truly are
extraordinary. He vanished in an instant, and it wasn’t some sort
of movement technique.” The Immortal cultivators all began to chat
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten plainly dressed
elders who were guarding the teleportation array were all puzzled as
well. Why’d he leave? To change the destination and to verify the
teleportation was a simple, fast matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Northson whispered. “Although I’ve
heard of the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains long ago, I don’t
know how dangerous it is, exactly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is quite
famous…it is ranked as one of the most dangerous locations within
the borders of our Stillwater Commandery. I heard that in that place,
there are many areas where space is fractured, and which might lead
directly to some fractured dimensions. There are many monsters lying
in wait there, and according to legend, even Fiendgods lie in hiding
there,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The land under the
control of the Grand Xia Dynasty was simply too vast. Aside from some
safe areas like Swallow Mountain, there were also countless
mysterious, special, dangerous regions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Earth of
Ning’s previous life had, in an area of ten thousand kilometers,
countless mysteries and secret areas. The same was true, naturally,
for the vast world ruled over by the Grand Xia Dynasty. Within
Stillwater Commandery, there were quite a few bizarre places, and
some had been created as part of the aftermath of battles that had
occurred back in the Fiendgod Era. There were also Immortal estates,
relic sites left behind by major powers, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the top ten
danger zones of the entire Stillwater Commandery were the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains! However, these danger zones were also
filled with countless opportunities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, too, have heard
that there are Fiendgods here.” Suddenly, a handsome, white-robed
man moved closer to them. Ning and Northson both turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists Ji
Ning, Mu Northson,” the handsome, white-robed man immediately said
with a laugh. “I am Eastriver Cloudsoar, and my Daoist title is
Cloudsoar as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist title is
Twinwood,” Northson said quite straightforwardly. At the same time,
he glanced at Ning, then continued, “My senior apprentice-brother
is Ji Ning. His Daoist title is Darknorth! Right, you just spoke of
Fiendgods…can it be that there truly are Fiendgods within the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome,
white-robed man immediately said, “Can it be that you two have
never heard of the legends of the ‘Gaol Mountains’?” “The
legends of the Gaol Mountains?” Ning and Northson exchanged
glances, then shook their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to legend,
an unfathomably long time ago, just as the Fiendgod Era was drawing
to an end,” Cloudsoar said slowly, “The group of powerful
Immortals who had established the Grand Xia Dynasty used a
tremendously powerful magic treasure to imprison and seal a large
group of Fiendgods! This powerful magic treasure is the ‘Gaol
Mountains’. It would have been incredibly difficult to kill all the
Fiendgods, and most likely some of the Immortals would have died as
well. Thus, they simply used the Gaol Mountains to seal these
Fiendgods away. The Gaol Mountains sealed them away from the outside
world, completely separating them away and preventing them from
absorbing the energy of the outside world. The Fiendgods would only
grow weaker and weaker, and after a million years, they would become
incomparably weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
listened and nodded. Immortal cultivators and Fiendgods; at a certain
level, they wouldn’t need to eat or drink, but they would still
need to absorb energy from the outside world. Ki Refiners would
absorb natural, elemental ki, while Fiendgods and Fiendgod Body
Refiners would absorb some other types of energy, such as the energy
of the Five Elements, the energy of the stars, the energy of the sun
and the moon, etc. If one was unable to absorb energy from the
outside world, one would naturally grow weaker and weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But afterwards…an
extremely powerful Fiendgod who was amongst the group that had been
sealed away actually managed to break through the Gaol Mountains and
charge out of the sealed grounds! A wild, savage battle erupted. The
Immortals and the Fiendgods fought viciously, causing the entire
region to shatter and crack. Although no one knows what the results
of that battle were, the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains ended up
the way they currently are,” Cloudsoar said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “The
Eastriver clan lives up to its reputation. You even know about
secrets like this.” Cloudsoar laughed as well. “I’ve just
flipped through some books on myths and legends and heard of this
explanation. I have no idea if it is real or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that back in
the Fiendgod Era, the Fiendgods dominated this world,” Ning said.
“Now, however, it is us humans who dominate the vast world, with
monsters being somewhat weaker…and there are almost no Fiendgods
left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s eyes were
shining. “I’m quite curious about the Fiendgod Era as well.”
Cloudsoar laughed. “When we grow stronger, we’ll naturally learn
more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This must be clearly
investigated!” The silver-haired, black-robed man was in midair,
and his voice snapped out icily. Next to him was a black-furred,
three-eyed hound who stood in midair. It spoke out. “Yes! If anyone
from the Northmont clan of Stillwater impedes us…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
The silver-haired, black-robed elder said in a cold voice. “Don’t
act in your capacity as Raindragon Guards, but kill all those who
oppose you. This matter must be investigated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
three-eyed, black-furred hound said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Marquisates
have grown too accustomed to ruling over the territory which has been
enfeoffed to them. They all grow restless, and every so often, they
need to be given a drubbing,” the silver-haired, black-robed elder
said in a cold voice. “It seems yet another group of people shall
die in the Northmont clan of Stillwater Commandery. Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The body of
the black-furred, three-eyed hound flickered, and then it disappeared
without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the
silver-haired, black-robed elder ride his flying cloud downwards at a
leisurely pace. Soon, he arrived at the mountain peak which contained
the teleportation array. Atop the peak was Ning, Northson, and the
rest of the Immortal practitioners, all of whom had been waiting for
quite some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The
silver-haired, black-robed elder landed. Instantly, the surrounding
area fell silent. Those ten plainly dressed elders all looked towards
him respectfully as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, listen
clearly,” the silver-haired, black-robed elder said. “Those of
you who wish to join the Raindragon Guard; your testing grounds shall
be the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains! This place is one of the
most famous, most dangerous locations of Stillwater Commandery. What
you need to do is to survive in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains for three months, and bring back the head of a
Wanxiang-level monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you survive three
months and bring back the head of a Wanxiang-level monster, you will
join our Raindragon Guard. If you die in the wild marshes or come
back without the corpse or head of a Wanxiang-level monster, then you
will have failed. Understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed elder
swept them with a gaze. The hundred Immortal cultivators all nodded,
not hesitating in the slightest. There were many who participated in
the Raindragon Guard trials, and this mission they had been assigned
could be considered an ordinary one. Since they dared to come…they
naturally had some degree of self-confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” The
silver-haired, black-robed elder nodded. “Since that’s the case,
then all of you can head out now. I hope that in three months time,
I’ll be able to see you return with the head of a monster.
Remember; don’t underestimate those monsters. You wish to kill
them, but they also wish to kill you. The hatred that has built up
between us over countless years means that they won’t show you any
mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred Immortal
cultivators all agreed. Even the youngest amongst them, Mu Northson,
had a look of resolve in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, come in.
Don’t go beyond the limits of the teleportation base.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten plainly dressed
elders began to make the arrangements. Ning’s group all moved into
the teleportation array. The entire teleportation array was enormous,
capable of transporting thousands of individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, my master instructed me…that after we
go to the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, we must be wary of not
only the monsters, but also of other Immortal cultivators,”
Northson sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all know that
we are disciples of the Black-White College. The disciples of the
Black-White College are incomparably few in number, and each of us
carry priceless treasures on us. Thus, sometimes there will be group
attacks launched against us disciples of the Black-White College. We
are not yet Raindragon Guards…there are no laws against fighting
amongst potential recruits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning glanced
at Northson. Indeed, human hearts were hard to fathom. In his
previous life, he had lived during the era of the information
explosion…Ning had definitely learned far more things than most of
the people who lived in this comparatively closed, barbarian world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite that, Ning
still said, “I know. Junior apprentice-brother, you must be careful
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. If we two
disciples join forces, hmph…if one comes, we’ll kill one. If ten
come, we’ll kill ten!” Northson sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire surrounding
teleportation formation lit up. The blurry gray light on the surface
of the tower began to brighten, covering the entire teleportation
formation. Someone looking in from the outside would no longer be
able to see Ning and the other hundred Immortal cultivators within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white light
emanating from the peak of the tower suddenly increased in luminosity
a thousandfold. Its brilliance made it appear to be a second Golden
Crow within the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the bright light
turned dim, the blurry gray light returned to normal as well. Ning
and the hundred Immortal cultivators within the formation had already
disappeared. By now, they had already arrived at the wild marshes of

Chapter 12 - Entrance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a ripple pass
through the area around him. When he had been teleported from
Serpentwing Lake to the underwater estate, it had been a similar
feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Everything
before him suddenly grew clear. Mu Northson was standing next to him,
and other Immortal cultivators were around them as well. “We made
it?” Northson stared, wide-eyed, at the surrounding area. “That
really was fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully weighed
the surroundings as well. They were currently in a teleportation
array that was three hundred meters tall; clearly, it was a size
smaller than the one by the Crimson Dragon Mountains. Off in the
distance…there were wild marshes, mountains, lakes, and wilderness
all about them, as far as the eye cold see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two million
kilometers in the blink of an eye.” Ning had known what was going
to happen, but after experiencing it for himself, he couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement. “I heard that some Immortals can instantly
teleport a million kilometers. I wonder how long it will be before I
have that ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, come
out.” “Hurry up.” Two ancient voices rang out, and two plainly
dressed elders outside the teleportation array waved towards them.
Only now did the Immortal practitioners walk out from the
teleportation array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, listen
closely,” one of the white-haired, slightly-pudgy elders barked.
“These are the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. As far as you
should be concerned, the only safe spot in the entirety of the wild
marshes is this spot, right here! There are always Raindragon Guards
stationed here, and a grand formation has been laid down which no one
dares to trespass through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson all
looked over carefully. They, too, had discovered that this
teleportation formation was built atop a mountain peak, which was
ringed with Immortal cavern estates. Most likely, quite a few people
were stationed here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are a few
other things to remind you of,” the fat elder said. “The first is
that for three months, you are not permitted to come here. If you
come here to avoid danger, you will have failed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second is that
while you are adventuring in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains,
you must be extremely careful; do not stay in any single place for
too long, such as for a month or longer. You must know that there are
far more monsters here in the wild marshes than there are humans, and
they are far more familiar with the Gaol Mountains than you are. If
you stay in one place for too long…you will make it easy for the
monsters to join forces against you and attack you en-masse. However,
staying in one place to rest for a day or two every so often is
fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were listening carefully. This was all potentially life-saving
advice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third is that
although the monsters of the wild marshes are dangerous, the natural
environment of the Gaol Mountains is even more dangerous. Some places
might be filled with shattered space…if you aren’t careful, you
might exit our world, at which point, given your current level of
power, you will all die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth is that
due to environmental issues, getting one’s bearings is quite
difficult in the Gaol Mountains region. Don’t just rely on your
senses to judge directions! You need to judge the directions in
accordance with the movement of the sun, the moon, and the stars in
the skies. Otherwise, if you simply rely on your own senses…you
will never be able to return, and will forever be spinning in circles
within the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. The four
most important points have already been provided to you. Go. I hope
that in three months time, I’ll be able to see you all return,”
the fat elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the skinny
elder spoke out as well. “If you discover that it is too dangerous
and that you are unable to handle it, you’d best head back in a
hurry. Although you will have failed, you will have at least
preserved your life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go.” The fat
elder waved his hand. “Go,” the skinny elder said as well. Ning
and the rest of the Immortal disciples all stared towards those hazy
outlines of Immortal cavern estates ringing the mountain. They could
all sense the surge of powerful energy surrounding this entire
mountain peak. This was the power of that formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…swish!
Swish! One streak of light after another flew out from the peak at
high speed, flying towards the outside. Some moved alone, while
others moved in pairs or triplets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, where shall we go?” Northson asked.
“Every direction is the same,” Ning said. Sweeping the area with
his gaze, he pointed towards the North. “There are many mountains
over there. Let’s go over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
nodded. Whoosh! A dragon-headed ship suddenly appeared before them,
and Ning and Northson boarded the ship. This dragon-headed ship was
only thirty meters long; clearly, it was sized appropriately for
roaming the wild marshes. If they made it too large…it would just
make it easier for monsters to find them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the hundred
Immortal cultivators had all spread out in each direction. The two
elders responsible for guarding the formation had very complicated
looks in their eyes. The skinny one sighed, “I really envy them. I
can sense the vitality and energy just oozing from them. Clearly, all
of them are very young. Youth is a form of wealth, you know; they
have plenty of time to go fight, to struggle, and to go farther along
their Immortal paths. As for us…we won’t have these
opportunities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But at least we’ve
lived a few hundred years,” the fat elder laughed. The skinny elder
stared into the distance. “I wonder how many of this batch will
make it back alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If half can make it
back, that’ll be pretty good,” the fat elder said. “However…this
group knew exactly how dangerous things would be, and they still
elected to go adventure. If they can become Raindragon Guards…they’ll
be able to benefit from the vast Dao repositories and magic treasures
which the Guard possesses, and their Immortal paths will become more
surefooted ones. The particularly outstanding ones will even have the
chance to go to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty, where
they will be trained at our Raindragon Guard’s headquarters!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed boat
flew through the clouds in the sky. “These high clouds are actually
the safest places, here within the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains.” Northson was standing at the helm of the ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “However,
we still need to be careful. Once we discover any spatial ripples, we
need to immediately avoid them.” “I know,” Northson said. “The
warship is flying quite slowly, actually.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “Look.” Northson stared down through the thin clouds
below at a large mountain. This mountain was particularly majestic in
a queer way; it pierced straight through the clouds. In addition, one
could see with the naked eye countless monsters atop the mountain.
Some were monsters that were in human form. They appeared to be
moving about in a manner reminiscent of an army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, there must be Wanxiang-level monsters in
that great mountain,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what I
know…Wanxiang-level monsters are extremely common in the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains, and Zifu-level monsters can be seen
everywhere. As for Primal monsters…they are quite rare,” Ning
said. “Some monsters have taken over a mountain and have proclaimed
themselves the local king, while others travel by themselves. Those
who have taken over a mountain are all extremely strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite hard to
run into one of the Wanxiang-level monsters who are wandering about
by themselves,” Ning said reflectively. “So, our target should be
the monsters who have crowned themselves ‘kings’ of a mountain.
But from far away, we aren’t able to tell exactly how strong those
‘king’ monsters are. If we are unlucky, we might run into a
Primal monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Northson asked. Ning had come up with an idea long ago.
However, he looked at Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother
Northson, do you have any ideas?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do have a few,”
Northson said with a frown. “The first is to follow other Immortal
practitioners about and let them be the ones to investigate. When the
battle begins…after verifying that the target is a Wanxiang
monster, we’ll attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.” Ning
nodded in praise. Northson continued, “The second method is to
search for a mountain with monsters that don’t seem too strong.
Nine out of ten, that mountain would be the territory of a Wanxiang
monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the third idea?”
Ning prompted. Northson’s eyes lit up. “As Master said, the
hearts of men are difficult to fathom. Since that’s the case, I
imagine that there will be cases where Immortal cultivators will
attack other cultivators. Generally speaking, this would involve
several of them joining forces. If several of them join forces
against us…I refuse to believe that not a single one of them will
have acquired the corpse or the head of a Wanxiang monster. We can
set up a trap…so if anyone comes to ambush us, we’ll
counter-ambush and kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, all three
plans have their own flaws. I’m not confident in any of them.”
Northson was quite irritated. “Still, we have three months. That
should be enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Your
methods are good, but I have an even simpler one.” Northson looked
expectantly towards Ning. “What method?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Search for a
seemingly ordinary-looking mountain of monsters,” Ning said with a
laugh. Northson stared. “Isn’t that my idea?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After we find an
ordinary mountain…I’ll sweep it with my divine sense!” Ning
laughed. “If the opponent can sense my sweep, then it will most
likely be a Primal monster. If they aren’t able to…then they will
be Wanxiang monsters. Even if we are so unlucky as to run into one of
the incomparably rare Primal monsters, we can immediately use our
evasive techniques to instantly flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said,
startled, “Divine sense? Senior apprentice-brother, your soul has
truly reached the divine sense level?” Ning nodded. “You really…”
Northson was shocked. “When you joined and defeated senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow and the others, you demonstrated the
ability to use multiple sword arts. Many of our senior fellow
disciples suspected that your soul must be extremely powerful,
perhaps at the divine sense level. Even more of them suspected that
you were actually a reincarnated Immortal. So you actually have
reached the divine sense level? In the past three years, you’ve
never mentioned it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You never asked,”
Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then are you a
reincarnated Immortal as well?” Northson’s eyes were shining. “I
heard that as reincarnated Immortals grow older, they will gradually
reawaken their memories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“No clue. I haven’t awakened any Immortal memories, at least.”
What a joke. Ning’s memories of his past life were perfectly clear;
he wasn’t an Immortal at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Northson
nodded, then said excitedly, “This is wonderful. Joining the
Raindragon Guards poses a great test to others, but for you, senior
apprentice-brother, it’s far too simple. We can use your divine
sense to run a test from far away…and after verifying things, can
immediately act. If we are so unlucky as to run into a Primal
monster, we can immediately flee with evasion techniques. This really
is simple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “If
even someone with a divine sense is unable to join the Raindragon
Guard, that’d be quite bizarre, wouldn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badass,” Northson
grinned widely. “Then I, your junior apprentice-brother, shall
benefit from your strength, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, no need to be so polite.” Ning turned his gaze
downwards, beginning to search for mountains with monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just one hour later.
Ning and Northston were standing within a desolate area, staring
towards a towering mountain before them. Given Ning’s visual
acuity, he was able to see that there were some monstrous figures
within this mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one. Let me
search it,” Ning said. “Alright.” Northson had already taken
out a Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the two of
them were both capable of simple evasion techniques, and were able to
move multiple kilometers away with a single movement, with the aid of
a Dao-seal, they would be able to move a thousand kilometers away.
Ning knew that even a Primal monster would find it hard to search a
thousand kilometers with divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” With but
a thought, Ning instantly sent a surge of power divine sense forward,
enveloping this entire mountain.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_13___Two_Humans_Battle_T"></A>
Chapter 13 - Two Humans Battle Three Monsters
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s powerful
divine sense thoroughly investigated the entirety of the mountain,
inside and out. “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, what’s the
situation?” Mu Northson asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cracked a smile,
then looked at Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother Northson, need
you ask? This mountain really does have quite a few monsters within
it. Based on the aura of these monsters, there should be a single
Wanxiang monster and around ten or so Zifu monsters. There are also
some Xiantian monsters that can transform into human form, as well as
a crowd of lesser monsters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one?”
Northson chewed on his lips. “That’s it? There’s two of us
though.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, your idea was
the right one. We first find a seemingly-ordinary mountain of
monsters, with the expectation that the monsters within won’t be
too powerful,” Ning laughed. “A mountain like this, the two of us
can flatten when we charge in. However, this is the wild marshes of
the Gaol Mountains. Let’s be a bit cautious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll listen to you
in all things, senior apprentice-brother,” Northson nodded. “Let’s
go. Let’s sneak up the mountain.” Ning pointed upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said, worried,
“There should be formations, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there are
formations on these monster mountains, with my divine sense spread
out, I can see everything.” Ning had quite some experience in
analyzing formations, after all, while his Uncle White was a Godbeast
Whitewater Hound which was legendary for its intelligence and which
was a master of formations. Ning would often chat with Uncle White;
naturally, he would gain some pointers from him. Occasionally, Ning’s
own thoughts would cause Uncle White to gain certain insights as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Swoosh! Swoosh! The two stealthily slippd upwards through the wild
grass, moving closer and closer to the mountain at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-faced, muscular
fellow was seated in the lotus position atop a jade bed, looking
quite like an Immortal practitioner. The black-faced fellow suddenly
opened his eyes, and a baleful aura shot out from his eyes, but then
was quickly retracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stared towards the
stone door in the distance. With but a thought, he made the stone
door rumble open. Immediately, a small figure charged in from
outside. It was a skinny underling, who knelt down and said,
“Congratulations, Majesty, for having finished your meditations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The large,
black-faced man let out a grunt. “Go. Have the Madame come, and
arrange for a table of food to be prepared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The skinny
little figure respectfully departed at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-faced man
left his jade bed, walking leisurely out of the hall of his cavern
estate and moving outside the stone door. Standing outside, he seemed
to be able to see all sorts of sights in the vast marshes outside,
and a killing desire filled his eyes. “Humans often come in batches
to attack these wild marshes of our the Gaol Mountains. the Gaol
Mountains’s marshes belong to us monsters. If a human comes, we
will kill him. Mm…it’s been quite a long time since humans have
come to my place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild marshes of the
Gaol Mountains were simply too vast. There were quite a few human
Immortal cultivators who came to this place, but they were all spread
out extremely sparsely throughout the wild marshes. A monster would
only occasionally run into a human Immortal cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty years ago,
that human monster offered me quite the amount of liquefied elemental
essence and magic treasures, which I traded for liquefied elemental
essence as well. It allowed me to shave two centuries off of my
training, while my power increased greatly.” The black-faced man
was quite eager. “I wonder when I’ll met yet another foolish
human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who dared to
crown themselves kings of a mountain in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains naturally laid down many traps around their nest, making it
so that any humans who arrived would be unable to leave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Majesty!”
Suddenly, a soft voice rang out. The black-faced man turned to look.
A seductive, green-clothed, devilish woman entered, carrying a jade
platter with a beautifully carved beasthead goblet of wine, as well
as a perfectly made bottle of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madame.” The
black-faced man smiled. “Your Majesty, you’ve been training for
many months now. You’ve worked very hard. This is the wine which I
personally brewed, the ‘Immortal Moonspirit wine’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-clothed,
devilish woman walked over while speaking. Monsters, after becoming
Xiantian lifeforms, would gain intelligence equivalent to a human’s.
This green-clothed, alluring woman was a Zifu monster, while the
black-faced man was a Wanxiang monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training took up quite
a time…and these monsters knew how to enjoy themselves. They, too,
need companions. Although in this part of the world, the monsters
were tremendously powerful, it was still the Grand Xia Dynasty which
had truly unified the world, a dynasty of humans. Many of the major
powers amongst the monsters had official positions within the Grand
Xia Dynasty. This was actually the reason why monsters continued to
exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, although the
high-level individuals were on fairly good terms with each other,
generally speaking, human Immortal cultivators and monsters fought
quite fiercely against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sumptuous feast of
delicacies had been prepared, including meat, fruit, and wine. The
black-faced man picked up a piece of meat and began to chew it, then
frowned and barked towards the outside, “Go, go to rear mountains
and to the place where we are raising humans. Catch a tender one and
send it over. This meat is tasteless. Human flesh is much better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The monster
outside immediately replied in a high-pitched voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those humans eat the
flesh of us monsters, and in fact, some major power even created a
‘spirit-beast seal’ and other things to forcibly enslave us.”
The black-faced man let out a cold snort. “We monsters naturally
can eat humans as well, and in fact, we should enslave them as well!
Since there’s a spirit-beast seal, why can’t there be a
‘human-slave seal’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring,
green-clothed poured a goblet of wine for her king. “Your Majesty,
I heard that beyond the greater worlds, there is are major powers
amongst the monsters, capable of dominating the Three Realms, who are
indeed capable of creating a method for enslaving humans. But
unfortunately…in our greater world, the world is formally ruled
over by the Grand Xia Dynasty. How can they possibly permit a
technique allowing monsters to enslave humans be spread out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madame, is there
truly a method by which monsters can enslave humans?” The
black-faced man stared at the alluring, green-clothed woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s just a
legend.” The alluring woman shook her head. “How would I, a minor
Zifu-level monster, know about such things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-faced man let
out a cold snort. “After I become a monster Immortal one day, I
will definitely…not good!” The black-faced man suddenly rose to
his feet, staring outside the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Majesty?” The
alluring woman was shocked. The look on the black-faced man’s face
had changed, and he slapped the table, which with a shudder
disintegrated into white dust. He roared with fury, “Since you dare
come, why haven’t you shown yourself?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Majesty, we
caught a delectable human child for you.” A terrified voice rang
out from afar. And then…“AHHH!” A miserable scream, and then
the terrified voice was cut off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman in
the cavern estate knew that something was amiss. Terrified and
restless, she said, “Your Majesty, what is going on? What is
happening? Has a human Immortal cultivator come? Don’t we have
layers of formations and restrictive spells here? How could the human
cultivators made it all the way here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-faced man
just stared fixedly towards the outside. “They are formations
experts,” he said, gritting his teeth. What he didn’t realize was
that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had actually gone
around quite a few of his formations while avoiding activating the
others. Ning had thus gone straight through, not setting off any
alarms at all. In the end, Ning had been forced to break through the
bewildering formation which was always active and protecting the
caverns; this was why the black-faced man was suddenly shocked into
wakefulness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t cry, don’t
cry. In a short while, Big Brother will help you slaughter that
monster.” Three human figures walked over. Walking in front was a
fur-clad human youth, while behind was a white-robed youth who was
holding the hand of and comforting a toddler who was dressed in just
leaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waa, waaaaaa.” The
toddler sobbed, tears still cascading down. Just now, the monster had
instantly been chopped into mincement, which had utterly terrified
the toddler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, enraged,
pointed straight at the black-faced man. “Monster, the day of your
death has come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, it’s been
quite some time since I encountered any human Immortal cultivators.
You dared to come to my place? Today shall be the day of your
deaths.” The black-faced man suddenly produced two massive black
scimitars, then let out an angry howl. “DIE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Above the hall,
one bright star after another, and within this sea of stars, there
was even a brilliant moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
black-faced man’s face was savage. As for Northson, he howled in
anger, “Senior apprentice-brother Ning, hand this monster to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was
comparatively immature in terms of personality. Upon learning that
this child was about to be eaten by this old monster…his belly had
instantly become filled with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded, standing to one side, but prepared to attack at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Northson howled
in range, the skies above him also became filled with stars. Amidst
the sea of stars, both a brilliant moon and a blazing sun appeared.
The sun and the moon hung in the skies…this caused the face of the
Wanxiang monster to change. Only extremely talented humans with
significant backgrounds were capable of manifesting such a
Manifestation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Northson
gnashed his teeth. Swish! Swoosh! Two black lights began to gather in
Northson’s hands. He opened them, and the two rays of black light
shot out, forming two massive water-snakes within the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Manifestations
struggled against each other, but the Wanxiang monster’s was
clearly struggling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Bang!”
The two giant water-snakes directly clashed in the air with the two
giant black scimitars which the black-faced man had unleashed. The
power of the collision was so great that even the nearby woman’s
face changed dramatically. Instantly, she transformed into a
white-furred fox, wanting to flee. However, a cold light flashed
through Northson’s eyes, and one of the water-snakes swept out with
its tail, smashing directly against the fleeing white-furred fox’s
body. Crunch. The white-furred fox spirit was crushed into meat
paste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
watching. He nodded to himself. “My junior apprentice-brother has
the upper hand. He lives up to his reputation as a genius of the Dao
of Constructs who entered the Black-White College at age fourteen.
Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had joined the
Black-White College at age fourteen, and had been completely absorbed
in his meditations in the Black-White Diagram. If it hadn’t been
for Ning eclipsing everyone else, Northson would have been a
dazzling, eye-catching genius. Only, because he walked the Dao of
Constructs, many of his senior fellow disciples weren’t able to
truly comprehend what a monstrous genius Northson truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” The
black-faced man immediately bellowed. He had the sense that things
were not right at all. In the past, he had once killed a human
Wanxiang Adept. How was this seemingly soft, weak, white-robed youth
so strong? In addition, the fur-clad youth standing behind the
white-robed youth seemed to be even more dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late to feel
regret!” Northson snapped coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t they
arrived yet? Why haven’t they arrived?” The black-faced man
struggled to endure. Although his power would increase dramatically
once he transformed into his real form, if he truly did that, this
would truly become a battle to the death. What he needed to do, right
now, was to delay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shattered the
talisman earlier. My Third Brother and Fifth Brother are located the
closest; with their movement techniques, they should have arrived by
now.” But suddenly, a hint of joy appeared on the face of the
black-faced man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense
something. Although the formations he had set around the mountain
hadn’t been able to detect these two humans, they had detected the
arrival of his two good brothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just you wait. My
Third Brother and Fifth Brother will suddenly ambush you, and with me
joining forces…the two of you will definitely die,” the
black-faced man mused to himself. At the same time, he continued to
furiously struggle to resist the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ning,
standing behind Northson, had a changed expression n his face. With a
cold snort, he said, “Old monster, so you actually have
reinforcements coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-faced man’s
heart instantly clenched. How had this Immortal cultivator found out?
Could it be that this Immortal cultivator had also set down a
formation in the area, and so had discovered his allies coming?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No longer considering
anything else, he immediately roared loudly, “Third Brother, Fifth
Brother, attack together and kill these two Immortal cultivators!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson also let out a
wild howl. “Two more coming? Wonderful! We were complaining about
there not being enough Wanxiang monsters!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards the
stone door outside the cavern estate, a faint sword-light flashing
through his eyes.

Chapter 14 - The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] Reveals Its Might
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures,
transformed into streaks of light, were making haste towards the
cavern estate of this monster mountain. One of the two figures was a
hawk-nosed, golden-robed man, while the other was a dark, skinny
youth. These were monster kings of two nearby monster mountains. The
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains were incomparably dangerous, and
even monsters had to form alliances to help each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this surrounding
area, a total of eighteen Wanxiang monsters had formed an alliance;
if one encountered any danger, they would immediately shatter their
runic talismans, and the other seventeen would all immediately be
aware of it and would come at maximum speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Wanxiang
monsters had all sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. It was
precisely because the eighteen of them had formed a mutual defensive
alliance that in this region, it was extremely rare for a monster to
be killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother
shattered his runic talisman. I wonder if he encountered one of those
lone wanderer freaks, or an Immortal cultivator!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us are
stronger than Big Brother. When we join forces…regardless of
whether its wandering monsters or Immortal cultivators, they will all
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two old monsters
were chatting mentally to each other. The original ranking of the
eighteen monsters was based on age and seniority, not strength. Their
Big Brother was a Blacktusk Elephant who had been training for a very
long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third Brother, Fifth
Brother, attack together and kill these two Immortal cultivators!”
Suddenly, a loud roar rang out from within the distant cavern estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
discovered!” The two Wanxiang monsters exchanged glances. They had
wanted to launch sneak attacks, but they no longer had the chance
now. “Kill!” They transformed into streaks of light, charging
directly towards the door of the cavern estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the cavern
estate, Mu Northson was exerting his strength to deal with the
black-faced man, while Ji Ning was holding onto the child’s hands,
looking at the expression of amazement on the child’s face. He said
consolingly, “Don’t worry. Just stay next to me and don’t run
around.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Three
streaks of light suddenly shot in from outside; it was a sharp knife
and two sharp awls. They were all incredibly sharp and had a shocking
aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning,
seeing the situation, applied his will. Whoosh! A dense cluster of
729 flying swords suddenly appeared next to Ning. At the very core of
those swords was a sword formation that was noticeably more powerful;
these were the ‘Nine Yang Sword Formation’ swords and 36
high-grade Mortal-ranked water-attribute flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other eight
major sword formations, four were formed from the 324 water-attribute
flying swords, while the other four were formed from fire-attribute
flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water and fire looped
amongst each other, and in the center were the ‘Nine Yang Swords’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], level nine!” Ning’s powerful divine will
completely filled these 729 flying swords, and they transformed into
fire and water, competing against each other and reinforcing each
other. The water was Yin in nature, while the fire was Yang in
nature; given Ning’s accomplishments in the art of formations, he
clearly now found it much easier to control the swords. Operating
this sort of exquisite, pure sword formation was actually quite
comfortable for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven hundred flying
swords, all of which are high-grade or top-grade,” Ning sighed
mentally. “In addition, half are fire, while the other half are
water; controlling them is an utter joy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Controlling so many
flying swords placed an incomparably shocking amount of pressure on
the soul. Ning, however, was able to withstand it easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle crackle
crackle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying swords rose
and fell in an undulating pattern, all of them emitting a hazy white
light on their surfaces. In front of Ning’s chest, an even more
brilliant, moving flying sword formed of white light had began to
form! This white flying sword was as pure as jade, and it was covered
with a lustrous layer of light that made it seem incomparably lovely.
The entire flying sword emanated this layer of light, as though it
were the treasure of an Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the
sword-light of the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]! Now that Ning was using such high-quality Mortal-ranked
swords, and had such a powerful soul to control them with….it could
be said that Ning had already reached the theoretical limit of power
a person at the Zifu Disciple level could reach when using the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Such power already vastly
oustripped even using the likes of divine abilities such as [Heavenly
Transformation] or the [Luminous Eye of the Heart]..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning smiled.
This white, jade-like flying sword shot out, streaking out in an arc
and flowing forward like water. Rumble…those three streaks of light
were trapped and blocked by this flowing stream of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I thought, the
fur-clad youth really is more powerful.” The black-faced man
currently battling against Northson felt shock in his heart. “He’s
actually able to simultaneously block the combination attack of two
of my brothers by himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! Thud! The
hawk-nosed, golden-robed man and the dark, skinny youth both landed
within the estate, and their gazes towards Ning were filled with
caution as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third Brother, Fifth
Brother!” The black-faced man hurriedly sent mentally, “The two
of you, deal with the fur-clad one. Leave the smaller one to me. Use
all your strength and kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, Big
Brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two newly arrived
Wanxiang monsters realized that if they were to maintain human form
and control magic treasures from afar, they probably wouldn’t be
able to suppress this fur-clad youth. “Human Immortal cultivator,
accept death!” The two monsters roared with rage, and then began to
transform. The hawk-nosed, golden-robed man instantly transformed
into a divinely handsome and golden-feathered winged eagle! As for
the other, the black, skinny youth, he instantly transformed into a
four-legged weirdbeast with coal-black skin and two curved yellow
horns on its head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The
black-faced man also transformed into mist, then resolidified into a
long-trunked elephant with enormous black tusks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three monsters were
now all in their true forms! In addition, the power of the magic
treasures they were using to attack Ning and Northson had suddenly
increased dramatically!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson,” Ning sent. “Will you be able to
hold?” Northson sent back confidently, “Don’t worry. I haven’t
even started using my abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
“Excellent.” Right at this moment, the gold-feathered eagle
charged forth with a howl, its pitch-black claws ripping through the
air and suddenly expanding tenfold in size to the point where the air
itself seemed to emit an ear-piercing screech. Ripples in the air
that could be seen with the visible eye appeared; the power of this
claw definitely surpassed that of the earlier magic treasure it had
used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monsters and humans
were different; monsters had bodies which were innately powerful and
possessed innate abilities. For example, some monsters had the innate
ability to control water; and even if they didn’t train in a
Fiendgod Body Refining Technique, they would still possess enormous
strength! Some of them might even be able to temper parts of their
body into magic treasures, such as their horns, their claws, or their
tails. This would result in their very body becoming an intrinsic
magic treasure, and thus possess astonishing power when used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
entire cavern estate was beginning to shake. The four-legged
weirdbeast had lowered its head, and its hooves thundered across the
ground as it charged towards Ning. The two curved yellow horns on its
head suddenly expanded in size and became even sharper than before,
and its hoofsteps became incomparably weighty, causing the entire
cavern estate to begin to shake and collapse. When these two monsters
used all their power, they were truly shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning shook
his head. “Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white sword formed
from the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
instantly slashed through the air. In midair, an enormous millstone
of fire and water suddenly appeared. Within the center of this
millstone of fire and water, a wild tempest of incomparable,
astonishing power suddenly formed! The white flying sword was in the
center of this millstone of fire and water, and it, too, dissolved
into the tempest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast! This was the
Ning’s [Tripartite Millstone Sword], the power of which was only
inferior to the second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. It could
also be referred to as the ‘Waterflame Millstone Sword’. Although
it was named after the slowly-grinding millstone, it was supremely
fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wherever the sword
light flashed past…fire and water howled as well, and the millstone
itself transformed into a blur! “Not good.” The golden-feathered
eagle sensed tremendous danger, but it still sent its sharp claws
over in a savage blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! It was too
fast. The flashing light of the millstone sword easily dodged past
the claw, then slashed past the body of the golden-feathered eagle.
The feathers of the golden-feathered eagle were incomparably tough,
as unyielding as a magic treasure…but they weren’t able to defend
against this attack in the slightest. They were immediately broken
through, and then the light of the Waterflame Lotus Sword turned,
sweeping directly towards the impending, charging weirdbeast monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third Brother!”
The four-legged weirdbeast monster was instantly scared silly. His
third brother had actually been killed in a single exchange. Everyone
in the region knew how powerful the eagle talons of his third brother
were. Ordinary hawks used their claws to snatch snakes; from this,
one can imagine how fast hawk claws could strike. And yet, the eagle
talons of a Wanxiang monster, an intrinsic magic treasure, still
hadn’t been able to block and snatch that sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never even heard
of swordplay on this level. But this was what a Sword Immortal was!
It must be understood that when Ning first joined the Black-White
College, he had been able to shock everyone just by using the first
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. Now, he had been able to use the
[Lesser Five Elements Sword] manual to develop this Waterflame
Millstone Sword, a technique which vastly surpassed the first stance
of the [Three-Foot Sword] in power. What’s more, the technique was
executed through a sword-light that was manifested by the ninth level
of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Its speed and power…how
could a Wanxiang monster possibly defeat it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” The
four-legged weirdbeast monster instantly slammed the ground with its
hooves, causing the entire cavern estate to tremble. It turned its
body, immediately ramming into the nearby stone wall, intending to
charge through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! The stone wall
was instantly shattered, but the light of the millstone sword
followed as fast as the wind, continuing to chase after it and not
intending to halt before it perished. The four-legged weirdbeast
tried to dodge, and it even shot out one of the sharp curved horns on
its head, sending it directly towards the sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light
flashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the
four-legged weirdbeast’s body continued to charge out of the cavern
estate through sheer momentum…but soon, it fell apart into two
pieces, slamming against the rocks outside the cave and causing them
to shatter and knock the nearby trees down. However, its bisected
body collapsed as well. Blood continued to ooze from its mouth, but
moments later, it breathed its last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Northson,
seeing that his senior apprentice-brother had shown off his power,
let out an angry roar as well. The two black water-snakes suddenly
criss-crossed, connecting to each other at the tail and instantly
forming an enormous black circle which wildly wrapped itself around
the black-tusked elephant monster, which was frantically attempting
to flee. As the black circle looped around it, it then
tightened…crunch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The upper half of the
body of the entire black-tusked elephant was instantly crushed into
meat paste, and it died a miserable death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
golden-feathered eagle that lay on the ground, it had died long ago.
And so, just like that, three Wanxiang monsters had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting the corpses of the golden-feathered eagle and the
four-legged weirdbeast. As for Northson, he collected the
black-tusked elephant’s corpse as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about to
collapse.” Northson charged outside. As for Ning, he had already
led the child outside the cave, which was covered with a spiderweb of
cracks. With a rumbling sound, it collapsed in on itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we instantly
acquired three corpses of monsters. All we need to do is wait three
months, and we’ll be Raindragon Guards.” Northson was extremely
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded gently. The power unleashed by his 720 Mortal-ranked flying
swords through the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had caused Ning
to feel delighted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey kid.” Northson
looked towards the young child. “Why are you here on this
mountain?” The child stared blankly. Just now, these two people had
effortlessly killed those three monsters, who had appeared to be so
incomparably terrifying and savage that his heart trembled from fear!
It was simply inconceivable that they had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing Northson
ask him where he came from, the child stared blankly for a moment,
but then his tears began to roll down. He pointed into the distance.
“There.”

Chapter 15 - Azure Skysnake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson turned to
look towards the direction which the child was pointing at, while
Ning went to hug the child. “Let’s go. I know where it is!” His
divine sense covered the entire monster mountain. How could Ning not
know?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! The two
transformed into streaks of light, vaulting through the mountain. The
many monsters within the mountain had all been utterly terrified and
had gone into hiding. Ning’s group quickly arrived within a deep
gorge within the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Northson
stared downwards, and what he saw made his face changed. Ning stared
down silently as well. Below the gorge, there was an extremely deep
crevice that was roughly three hundred meters long. Within the
crevice were humans, their bodies covered just by tree leaves and
bark. All of them were either children or youths; there wasn’t a
single old person there. They lived there in the deep crevice, numb
to life. Above the crevice, there was a net made from steel which
completely covered and sealed the crevice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are
being…raised here?” Northson’s body began to tremble slightly.
Grinding his teeth, he said, “These monsters truly deserve to die.
They deserve to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Northson leapt
downwards. There were some lesser monsters standing guard within the
deep crevice; they didn’t know that their king had already
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who goes there! This
is Elephant-King Mountain!” A tall, horned monster with a trident
in its hands roared angrily, while the group of lesser monsters
behind him howled in support.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Northson
let out an enraged snort. The area around him instantly transformed
into the darkness of the night. The night sky was filled with
dazzling stars, and the sun and the moon hung there amongst them.
From within the dazzling sun, a giant hand suddenly stretched out,
seizing the suddenly-terrified monsters who were trying to flee,
pale-faced. Trapped by that giant hand of golden light, the monsters
all felt their hearts shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are they here?”
Northson thundered. As for Ning, he just stood to one side, quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty Immortal, are
you referring to these human slaves?” The horned monster, captured
by the hand of golden light, hurriedly explained, “These human
slaves were brought here long, long ago by his Majesty, who found
them elsewhere and decided to raise them here. The big ones birth
little ones, and when the little ones grow up, they can birth more!
His Majesty delights in eating human flesh, and so the younger,
tender ones are for his Majesty to eat. As for some of the older
slaves, their meat isn’t as delicious, and so we’ll be given some
of it to taste.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ning’s face
turned ashen as he heard this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You deserve death!”
Northson let out a thunderous roar, and his Manifested hand clenched.
Instantly, those monsters, howling in agony, were crushed into meat
sludge. Even that horned monster who had transformed back into his
original form was crushed into mincemeat by that Manifested hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clank!” The
Manifested hand then clawed downwards, ripping apart those locked
steel chains. With a explosive sound, the many chains were instantly
shattered into small pieces, and then were tossed to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many humans who
were living within that deep crevice were trembling. They all moved
closer to each other, staring upwards in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve been
raised as animals for too long; their slave-mentality has been deeply
imprinted upon them.” Ning shook his head and let out a soft sigh,
then lowered his head to look at the child next to him. “Only the
smaller, younger children might be able to recover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson looked at Ning. “Let’s help them
out, okay?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Of
course we’ll help them. To us, it’s just a little bit of extra
effort, but to them…it means the changing of their destinies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded, then said with frustration, “But we must stay within the
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains for three months. We can’t be
taking care of them for this entire time. What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we encounter any
danger, we can’t look after them as well as ourselves. Let’s
deliver them straight to the Raindragon Guard,” Ning said. “That
is the only safe place within the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.
As for whether or not the Raindragon Guard will accept them…let’s
discuss that if it comes to that. Even if the Raindragon Guard aren’t
willing to take care of them, we can give these humans some food and
let them survive for three months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s something,”
Northson nodded. Rumble! The giant hand of golden light pressed
downwards, and instantly a deep passageway appeared at the margins of
the crevice, leading from it to the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From now on, you are
no longer slaves!” Northson stared at the humans within the corral
as he called out to them in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These humans had always
lived together, and so they had naturally managed to teach each other
and pass down the human language. Naturally, they understood.
However, their simple minds made it so that they remained rather
uneasy. They stared, frightened, towards the two youths standing in
the distance; one a fur-clad youth, while the other was a white-robed
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…even after the
passage of many years, they would never be able to forget this
life-altering moment. They would never be able to forget these two
youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson, let them board the warship,” Ning
said. “Right.” Northson nodded, then waved his hand. Instantly,
the Azure Dragon in the sky quickly transformed into a dragon-headed
warship which landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning barked out, “All
aboard the ship!” At the same time, he used his divine sense to
invisibly influence them. Although Ning had not learned the
[Soulcharmer Art], he had still viewed the abridged version of the
technique and had learnd some of the most basic, elementary secrets
of it. By using his powerful soul to emit the slightest hint of a
soul-ripple, he was able to nudge these numb slaves to all shuffle
towards the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mommy.” The child
next to Ning ran straight towards his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
raised his head, staring towards the sky. “There are other Wanxiang
monsters coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Northson,
however, was filled with a surging killing intent. But Ning shook his
head. “Don’t push it. We attacked that elephant monster, and two
more Wanxiang monsters suddenly popped up out of nowhere. And now,
four more Wanxiang monsters are attacking…if this continues, who
knows how many Wanxiang monsters will arrive. I imagine that these
monsters must have formed an alliance long ago, and they might even
have Primal monsters supporting them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson instantly came
to his senses. “Senior apprentice-brother, your words are correct.”
He nodded his head. “We already have enough Wanxiang monster
corpses. There really is no need to kill any more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The
dragon-headed warship quickly soared into the skies, flying into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
an incomparably beautiful woman, along with two men and a second
woman, arrived in sequence outside the demolished ruins of the cave
estate. “I can no longer sense the auras of big brother, third
brother, and fifth brother,” the beautiful woman said with a frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninth Sister, can it
be that that big brother and the others have already died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We already came
quite fast. They’ve only fought for a short period of time. The
three of them were all Wanxiang monsters.” The other Wanxiang
monsters didn’t dare believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beautiful woman
shook her head. “Look at the bloodstains. Look at the auras left
behind. Big brother and the other two are probably already dead.”
But suddenly, she lifted her head. A streak of light was soaring into
the skies, rapidly charging into the clouds. That streak of light was
a dragon-headed warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The warship of an
Immortal cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be the one
which killed big brother and the others. Ninth Sister, let’s attack
and get revenge for big brother and the others.” The other monsters
immediately began to clamor out. Eighteen of them had joined into an
alliance…but in terms of power, their ninth sister, the peacock
monster, was the most powerful of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beautiful woman
remained silent for a moment, then said, “If they were able to kill
big brother and the other two in such a short period of time, even if
we charged over to gain revenge, most likely more than half of us
would die. But if we were to wait for the other monsters to come…they
will have fled long ago. Let’s go. We can only blame big brother
and the others for having terrible luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other monsters were
only calling out in bravado anyhow. Upon hearing the words of the
peacock monster, they all nodded quite quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all transformed
into streaks of light, departing from Elephant King Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the eighteen
Wanxiang monsters had died; this made the peacock monster and the
other monsters feel as though their forces were not strong enough.
Thus, they decided that they were going to ally with some of the
other nearby Wanxiang monsters as well. In fact, they even began to
wonder if they should try to recruit some of the solitary wanderer
Wanxiang monsters as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a deep mountain
cave in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slither, slither…”
A small azure serpent was swimming about in a pool of water within
the cave. The water of this pool emanated an azure light and a
freezing aura, and there was a block of ice emerging from the center
of the pool. If an Immortal cultivator saw it…they would instantly
recognize this piece of ice as being a piece of ‘ancient glacial
ice’. It would only be formed in places where the elemental energy
was extremely, extremely cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How truly
comfortable. The wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains really are
wonderful. This dangerous, mysterious place is filled with many
treasures, but I can easily slip past all of them using my Void
Blink.” The little azure snake wriggled about in delight,
frantically absorbing the energy from this freezing pool. “Compared
to before, my homeland of Swallow Mountain is an utter wasteland.
There’s almost no treasures there at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wheeeeee. Wonderful,
wonderful!” The little azure snake was incomparably delighted. “It
seems as though the masters were correct in having me come here to
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.” The little azure snake’s
little head swung to wrap around the piece of ancient glacial ice.
Pulses of cold energy flowed into its body. “My power is rising
incredibly quickly. When I first arrived at the Gaol Mountains, I was
just at the peak Zifu level. Now, three short years later, I’ve
risen to the middle Wanxiang level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I’m still
much weaker than the Patriarch. How long will it be before I, too,
will become a monster Immortal? By then, I’ll be able to take up a
large reach of land for myself as well and style myself the Immortal
master of the region.” When the little azure snake thought about
the Patriarch, its eyes couldn’t help but be filled with envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The little
azure snake’s eyes suddenly radiated a cold light. “After leaving
the Gaol Mountains, I need to make a trip back to Swallow Mountain to
take care of some things. In particular, that Ironwood Zhan who
pursued and attacked me…I was in such a miserable state back then.
I must kill him and annihilate the entire Ironwood clan!” When it
thought about its hated foe, Ironwood Zhan, the little azure snake
also thought about someone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the very young
human youth, the one who always dressed in fur clothes. That
fearless, yet monstrously talented youth who always addressed it as
‘little snakey-snake’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas. I only know
that you are of the Ji clan. I don’t even know your name.” The
little azure snake muttered to itself, “You and I fought multiple
times, and it was only as a result of those fights that I
comprehended the ‘Void Blink’’ technique. However, back then, I
wasn’t able to save you. Don’t worry. When the time comes, I’ll
take revenge on behalf of you as well. I’ll annihilate that
Ironwood Zhan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are still
alive…given your talent, you must be very powerful by now.” The
little azure snake began to mumble to itself again. “But definitely
not as powerful as me. I have the Void Blink technique and have
gained many marvelous legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…a
hundred kilometers outside the cave…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two Immortal
cultivators, moving like streaks of light, who had stealthily landed
on the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t
mistaken, are you?” One of them, a gray-robed Immortal cultivator,
said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely not. When
I tortured those Zifu monsters, they definitely wouldn’t have dared
to lie to me. They all said that in recent days, a lone wanderer has
appeared in this region; an Azure Skysnake monster which had even
fought multiple times against their king,” the white-robed Immortal
cultivator said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed Immortal
cultivator nodded. “After we kill this Azure Skysnake, we’ll have
enough Wanxiang monster corpses. Supposedly, this Azure Skysnake
isn’t that powerful, but we need to beware of its innate ability.
Don’t let it use the Void Blink technique to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally.” The
white-robed Immortal cultivator nodded.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the icy pool
inside the cave. The small azure snake was ceaselessly absorbing the
frigid energy of the icy pool, using it to nourish the ‘demon-ice’
in its body. Suddenly, its eyes flickered. It transformed into mist,
and then reformed into an azure-robed maiden by the side of the pool.
Red lips, ivory teeth, and dark eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually dare
come to my place?” The azure-robed maiden muttered, “All I wanted
to do was spend some extra time nourishing the demon-ice in my body,
and yet they still come to cause trouble. Still, I’m not strong
yet. It’s not good for me to fight.” The azure-robed maiden
transformed into mist once more, and a small azure serpent appeared
in midair. With a flicker, it disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed
cultivator and gray-robed cultivator were currently advancing
stealthily through the cave, searching for any traces of the snake.
Suddenly, they saw an azure light flash in the distance. An azure
serpent in midair was roaring with anger, “You two human
cultivators dare come to my place? You are dead meat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice echoed and
thundered. Rumble…the azure serpent flashed in midair, then
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was the Azure
Skysnake monster! It found us.” The two Immortal cultivators were
instantly shocked. And then, the white-robed cultivator sent
mentally, “This Azure Skysnake seems to be quite angry; it’s
probably going to attack us. Let’s respond to its plots with one of
our own; let’s quietly set down a space-sealing formation in the
area! Once it draws near, we will immediately activate the formation,
causing it to be unable to flee through Void Blink. Only then will we
attack and kill it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Be careful
and make sure you set it up stealthily. Don’t let it discover you,”
the gray-robed cultivator sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of kilometers
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, I told those
two that they were dead meat, so those two buffoons will definitely
plan to fight me there. I’m an Azure Skysnake…my life is quite
precious. Why would I fight head on against you two?” The Azure
Skysnake continued to blink forward, disappearing once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Mu Northson
were currently mounted on their dragon-headed warship, carrying the
many humans towards the place in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains where the Raindragon Guard were stationed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands of
kilometers away from Ning’s location. Another ship was present
here, with two on this ship as well; one female, the other male. The
man was tall, strong, and handsome; it was Eastriver Cloudsoar. The
woman was also as beautiful as a flower; her name was Eastriver
Snowite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, it’s
not too hard to kill Wanxiang monsters. With the two of us working
together, in but a single day, we’ve already killed two of them,”
Eastriver Snowite said happily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing two monsters
isn’t that big a deal. The two of us were lucky; the first monster
mountain we chose had two Wanxiang monsters present, and that’s
exactly the number we needed to kill. By the time the other Wanxiang
monsters arrived, we used the Lesser Teleportation Dao-seals to
flee.” Eastriver Cloudsoar shook his head. “The more important
requirement the Raindragon Guard gave us was to survive in the Gaol
Mountains’s wild marshes for three months…three full months!
These marshes are full of danger everywhere. Surviving will be much
harder than killing one or two Wanxiang monsters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastriver Snowite said,
“Big Brother, didn’t you say that the closer we are to the
Raindragon Guard, the safer it will be? The monsters stay far away
from that place…although we won’t be able to enter, we can just
find a place close to the encampment and stay for three months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Still, we
need to be careful,” Cloudsoar said. “This place isn’t like the
clan…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know,” Snowite
responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
another warship flew over from far away. “Eh?” Eastriver
Cloudsoar and Eastriver Snowite both turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, so it is
fellow Daoist Cloudsoar, of the Eastriver clan.” Laughter rang out
from the distant warship. Atop the warship was a white-robed man with
a graceful bearing. The Eastriver siblings immediately recognized
him…this was one of the hundred testees, Northriver Zhou.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Northriver,” Eastriver Cloudsoar called back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare
and fortunate that I would be able to encounter you two siblings
here, fellow Daoist Cloudsoar. Would you be willing to board this
construct-ship of mine and share some wine?” Northriver Zhou
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” Eastriver
Snowite revealed a smile. But Cloudsoar shook his head. “No. No
need.” This caused Snowite to look towards her older brother
curiously, but Cloudsoar just gave her a glance. Snowite didn’t
argue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, then I won’t force things.” Northriver Zhou was quite
straightforward. With a laugh, he said, “I’ll leave, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just as his words
came out…Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Five streaks of
light suddenly flew out towards every direction, moving
lightning-fast. These five streaks of light…were five Wanxiang
Adepts, all of them amongst the testees for joining the Raindragon
Guard. The bodies of the five Wanxiang Adepts all emanated a blurry
gray light, and the body of Northriver Zhou, still standing atop that
warship, also shone with that light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six of them in total!
The gray lights were all connected, surrounding this region. “A
spacelock formation!” The faces of Eastriver Cloudsoar and
Eastriver Snowite completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…”
Cloudsoar’s face was ashen as he stared at the six surrounding
Immortal cultivators. “Dong One of Snowdragon Mountain, Xu Manquan
of the Thousand Rivers Sect, Northriver Zhou of the Skysplitter Sword
Sect…you actually prepared a spacelock formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lesser Teleportation
Dao-seals were only useful against Zifu Disciples and ordinary
Wanxiang Adepts. The majority of powerful Wanxiang Adepts would carry
a spacelock formation with them. Once they set it down…there would
be no way to teleport within the region with locked space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four peak Wanxiang
Adepts, two late Wanxiang Adepts.” Cloudsoar and Snowite exchanged
a glance, despair in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.” A cold
look flashed through Northriver Zhou’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudsoar and Snowite
went berserk as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Eastriver
Cloudsoar, will definitely get revenge! Definitely!!!” A desolate,
fierce, hate-filled cry rang out from far away. Eastriver Cloudsoar,
who had charged outside of the spacelock formation, his body covered
in blood and missing an arm, immediately used his Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seal and disappeared. As for his little sister, she
was already dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, these two
siblings weren’t faced against Wanxiang monsters who didn’t have
any legacies or treasures; they faced human Wanxiang elites who were
also from famous tribes and clans!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four peak Wanxiang
Adepts, two late Wanxiang Adepts. Upon joining forces, they were
absolutely able to crush the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Eastriver
Cloudsoar managed to escape.” Northriver Zhou shook his head. “He
should consider himself lucky.” The other five flew back to the
warship, while Zhou picked up the magic storage belt of the slain
Snowite, beginning to look through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it?” The
others asked. “Not bad. There’s the corpse of a Wanxiang monster
here.” Northriver Zhou handed the magic storage belt to someone
next to him, letting them all look through it. Although the six of
them had joined forces to support each other in killing others, and
although they had sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens, they all
still wanted to look through the spoils of war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northriver Zhou
laughed. “Three months. It’ll definitely be quite easy for us to
find six Wanxiang monster corpses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right..” The
golden-robed Dong One smiled and nodded. “Those Immortal
cultivators who slew Wanxiang monsters will most likely all return to
move close to the Raindragon Guards. As long as we patrol this
area…we’ll definitely run into more. Any we run into, we kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll keep doing
this, then.” All of them were filled with eagerness. Upon killing
cultivators, not only would they acquire Wanxiang monster corpses,
they would also be able to obtain the magic treasures of those
cultivators. This was far more profitable than just killing monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Eastriver
Cloudswear, swear that I will definitely kill them.” Cloudsoar
appeared in midair, covered in blood. His eyes were filled with hate.
“Northriver Zhou. Xu Manquan. Dong One…” Cloudsoar gritted his
name as he recited the names, one after the other, as though he was
storing them deep into his memory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister…little
sister.” Cloudsoar’s tears began to fall. He had known all along
that the path of Immortals was an incomparably dangerous one, but who
would have thought that on his very first true adventure, his little
sister would die? This caused Cloudsoar, who had been excited and
eager, to become filled with boundless pain and hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that Wanxiang
Adepts often killed each other, and that the seniors of their clans
wouldn’t generally intervene. Only if, say, a Primal Daoist had
acted against a Wanxiang Adept, which would be a case of a senior
bullying a junior, would the seniors of the sect intervene. So long
as the fights were amongst those of the same generation…if you
died, you could only blame yourself for being weak!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if the
person who died was a junior who was particularly beloved by a
powerful figure, such as the sole disciple of someone…then the
powerful figure might go berserk and ignore protocol to gain revenge
for that junior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson road
atop the warship, constantly advancing towards the Raindragon Guard’s
encampment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Northson stared at those terrified,
restless humans, then said softly, “They are still terrified and
uneasy. Even now…they are still afraid of us. Only the children
have a bit more courage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve been
enslaved for too long.” Ning shook his head. “Slavery has rooted
itself within them. To change that will be very, very hard. The
children have some hope.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at the
first child they had saved. Smiling, he walked over to them. Next to
the child was a grimy-looking woman. Terrified, she immediately
pulled her son away, but her son was fearless. He just looked at
Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, what’s your
name?” Northson said. “My name is Ironboy!” The child raised
his head and said, “What are your names, Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson laughed. “My
name is Mu Northson. Over there is my senior apprentice-brother, Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson. Ji
Ning…” The child gently murmured the names, as though memorizing
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed and walked
over as well. “This Ironboy is quite clever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and Northson
were chatting with the kid, a distant ship was beginning to draw
close to theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. That
dragon-headed warship.” Northriver Zhou pointed towards the
distance. “If memory serves, that dragon-headed warship belongs to
one of the hundred, that Black-White College disciple, Mu Northson;
it’s the construct-warship he displayed. Most likely, Mu Northson
and his senior apprentice-brother are on that ship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every member of the
Black-White College is a peerless genius. They aren’t easy to deal
with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These people began to
hesitate. But the golden-robed Dong One said, “No need to worry. I
understand this Ji Ning quite well. He should only be twenty years
old! Although his talent is astonishing, he’s trained for too short
a period of time. You should all be aware that his [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is only at the ninth stage. He’s a bit
dangerous in close combat, but as long as we can stay away from him,
we don’t need to fear him at all. As for that Mu Northson, since he
follows this Ji Ning’s lead, his strength probably isn’t that
great either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of them are
headed back…they probably have the corpses of two Wanxiang
monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciples of the
Black-White College. Killing them is worth more than killing quite a
few Wanxiang Adepts. In addition, one of them is a middle-stage
Wanxiang Adept, while the other is a Fiendgod Body Refiner who can
just barely be considered an early-stage Wanxiang Adept. Us? Four of
us are peak Wanxiang Adepts, while the other two are late-stage, and
we can join together in a six-man formation attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given that we’re
plotting against them while they aren’t against us, we have
excellent chances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the six came to a
unified agreement. “Let’s go. Let’s kill these two ‘peerless
geniuses’ of the Black-White College!” Northriver Zhou’s eyes
flashed with a savage light.

Chapter 17 - Waylaying the Disciples of the Black-White College
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth with loose,
unbound hair said in a low voice, “We are definitely going to kill
them, but don’t forget…earlier, when the six of us joined forces
against those two siblings of the Eastriver clan…the final result
was that Eastriver Cloudsoar escaped! These two are of the
Black-White College. Although one is a middle-stage Wanxiang Adept
and the other can be considered an early-stage Fiendgod Wanxiang
Adept, they certainly are carrying many protective magic treasures.
If we aren’t careful…the two of them might end up escaping in the
end. The final result would be, not only would they remain alive, we
would have created enemies for ourselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jihe’s words are correct.” The golden-robed
Dong One nodded. “There exists some enmity between Ji Ning and my
Snowdragon Mountain, and I am quite familiar with him. He is a truly
monstrous talent, and his training speed is astonishing. If he were
to escape, we would definitely gain a powerful foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
considering the matter, in reality, none of these six Wanxiang Adepts
were truly afraid of creating enemies. Since they had decided to
embark on the path of cultivation, then they would strive to do
anything necessary to become Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to carefully
consider how to go about this,” said the only woman of the group.
“If we are going to attack, we must instantly use the most vicious
attacks we have and kill them before they have a chance to react.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My suggestion is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six cultivators
chatted amongst themselves. If the enemy was a Wanxiang monster, this
would be very simple, but the enemy were disciples of the Black-White
College. Even though they were just a middle-stage Wanxiang Adept and
the equivalent of an early-stage Wanxiang Adept, they didn’t dare
to be the slightest bit overconfident. The disciples of the
Black-White College couldn’t be judged in accordance with normal
logic. If these two were both peak Wanxiang Adepts, the six of them
probably wouldn’t choose to attack at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have higher
foundations than them, and we are working together. I refuse to
believe we won’t be able to kill them.” This was what the six
cultivators all believed, and the reason why they decided to act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t notice
any of this at all. He continued to chat with his junior
apprentice-brother about the disciples. But right at this moment… <BR>
“Eh?” Ning turned to look. He stared past the railing, to a
distant warship flying over from afar. “This warship…this seems
to be the construct-warship which that Northriver Zhou of the
Skysplitter Sword Sect used, when the hundred of us dispersed in
different directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal cultivators
had astonishingly good memories. Ning had clearly memorized all of
the names of the hundred, when they had reported them to the
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, that’s the warship of Northriver Zhou of the
Skysplitter Sword Sect,” Northson said softly as well. “Right.”
Ning nodded, staring into the distance. That ship was drawing closer
and closer to them…why?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” An
elegant, refined-looking white-robed man was standing at the helm of
the warship, staring towards them. Laughing, the man said, “I
didn’t expect that I’d encounter the two disciples of the
Black-White College here. Northriver Zhou pays his respects.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is quite a
coincidence,” Ning said with a laugh. “It seems, fellow Daoist
Northriver, that you’ve already acquired a Wanxiang monster
corpse.” If another treated him with courtesy and a smile, unless
there was enmity or grievances between Ning and that person, Ning
wouldn’t treat them with a cold face either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was luck,”
Northriver Zhou said warmly. “It’s quite lucky for us to
encounter each other here. Why don’t you come aboard my vessel, and
we can drink some wine together?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Drink some wine
together?” Ning had a sudden thought. If it was just a matter of
chatting and drinking, that was one thing. But inviting them aboard
his warship…Ning began to grow nervous. After all, that was someone
else’s territory. With but a thought, he instantly filled the area
with his powerful divine sense. He saw with perfect clarity the
insides of that warship. Ning was instantly shocked. There were five
figures hidden within the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be alert.
Once this Ji Ning and Mu Northson board the ship, we’ll immediately
activate the grand formation. We need to kill them right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. As time goes
on, the situation might change. We have to make it fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as they
board the ship, they’ll be dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
stealthily chatting amongst themselves. This was a construct-ship
that was filled with restrictive spells to begin with, and so those
in the outside world couldn’t hear the conversations going on
within at all. Only Ning, capable of a divine sense, was able to
discover everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are going to
waylay and kill us!” This instantly came to Ning’s mind. “I
didn’t imagine that we’d encounter this as soon as we arrived at
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, shall we go?” Northson looked towards Ning. He
was rather thin-skinned; he found it hard to refuse someone who had
invited him over in such a friendly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother,” Ning hurriedly sent mentally, “Be careful
and don’t reveal anything, but…that warship has five other
Wanxiang Adepts hidden within it. All of them are amongst the testees
for joining the Raindragon Guard. Adding in Northriver Zhou, there
are six in total. Four are peak Wanxiang Adepts, while two are late
Wanxiang Adepts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” It was a
good thing that Ning had warned him; although on the surface,
Northson pretended to remain calm, in his heart, he was shocked. He
sent back, “Senior apprentice-brother, six Immortal cultivators?
Why haven’t the other five shown themselves? Can it be that they
are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They are
going to rob and kill us,” Ning replied. Northson was enraged.
“They actually dare to try to pull that on us? Let’s counter-kill
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful,” Ning
sent back. “Don’t underestimate them. They aren’t like those
Wanxiang monsters; they are from top-tier clans and tribes as well,
and their techniques will definitely be extraordinary. And, with six
of them joining forces…if we aren’t careful, we might perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
confident about himself, actually; he was a Fiendgod Body Refiner,
and his life force was incredibly strong. In addition, with his
ultimate secret weapon, the divine ability [Starseizing Hand]…yes,
Ning felt quite confident. However, Northson was still just a middle
Wanxiang Adept. In terms of elemental ki, he was far inferior to the
others. In addition, Northson was just eighteen, and in a true,
chaotic battle, Ning wouldn’t necessarily be able to take care of
this junior apprentice-brother of his. If his junior
apprentice-brother died here, Ning would never be able to forgive
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Northson immediately increased his own level of caution as well.
“Stay next to me,” Ning sent to him. “Don’t make any sudden
movements. Wait for my commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Northson
acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the two fellow
disciples decided through their private mental messages as to what
they would do, opposite them, Northriver Zhou continued to smile at
them and wait for their response. At the same time, he even said,
“I’ve always been quite filled with admiration towards the many
students of the Black-White College. It is my good fortune to be able
to meet you two fellow Daoists today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m ashamed to say
this,” Ning said apologetically, “But we’re busy. We won’t go
over for now. After we all complete the test to join the Raindragon
Guard, we’ll drink together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Northriver
Zhou cursed in his heart, but on the surface, he put on an
‘understanding’ look. “I understand. Then let us wait to meet
with each other after we join the Raindragon guard.” But at the
same time, he sent mentally, “Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five cultivators
within the ship, upon hearing this, exchanged glances and nodded.
They all immediately rushed outside. Only…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was even faster
than them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had noticed
through his divine sense that the five Immortal cultivators within
the ship had looked at each other and nodded, and were moving to
charge outside. He immediately willed his 720 Mortal-ranked flying
swords to appear in midair. “Junior apprentice-brother, attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment, two
giant black water-snakes appeared around Northson. The bodies of the
black water-snakes constantly flickered in an illusory manner, and
began to form into sharp spike sthat were covered by many runic
seals. The auras of the water-snakes immediately began to grow savage
and brutal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five figures moved
lightning-fast, charging outside of the ship, their bodies already
flashing with that blurry gray light. The spacelock formation was
already beginning to take shape. This was a formation which used six
Immortal cultivators as the formation-base, and the area covered by
the six cultivators would be the area locked in by the formation. But
of course, there was a maximum size of just a hundred kilometers or
so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Northriver Zhou, Dong One, and the others discovered to their
astonishment that Ji Ning and Mu Northson had actually acted even
before they did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They found us out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t hold
anything back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northriver Zhou’s
group reacted right away as well, and they immediately unleashed
their most powerful attacks. The six of them shared their elemental
ki through the formation, and their power burst forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Massive Ice Prison.”
The golden-robed Dong One pointed towards the distance. Whoosh! A
white, freezing aura that was visible to the naked eye swept towards
Ning. Ning and Northson were both standing in the air above the
dragon-headed warship, which was now completely closed off to the
outside world. Clearly, Ning and Northson didn’t wish to cause any
disasters to befall these slaves. Actually, if it wasn’t for these
slaves, Ning and Northson could’ve just fled through using Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…the slaves were
just one reason. The second was because both of them had just
departed from their schools, and they had proud hearts; why would
they flee without even fighting? Thus, the two didn’t even discuss
fleeing. In their minds was a single word - Fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s dire-ice!
This Dong One of Snowdragon Mountain actually was cultivating
demon-ice in his body.” Ning was startled. The inner Zifu of a
practitioner was an incomparably mysterious place. It could nourish
dire-ice, or earthfire, or demonwind…these were all extremely
terrifying natural elemental powers, and after being nourished in the
body, they would be able to unleash extremely great might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, to nourish
dire-ice, one would first need to find a secret location where
naturally-occurring dire-ice was, and then absorb it into the body.
One could only hope for but not count on encountering such a valuable
location. The power of this dire-ice, however, was absolutely not
lower than a divine ability’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Windmill
Formation!” The black-clothed Xu Manquan pointed towards the
distant Ning and Northson. Instantly, nine windmills suddenly
appeared and began to spin at high speed in the air, transforming
into tornado windmills which crushed the air itself as it smashed
towards the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anatta Sword!”
Their leader, Northriver Zhou, made nine flying swords appear before
him. They simultaneously struck out, and as they did, nine rivers of
sword light appeared, sweeping towards Ning and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nirvana Extinction!”
Jihe crossed his hands together, and out of nowhere, a gray energy
aura appeared which swept towards Ning and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Adept
Nongsan let out a cold laugh, then waved his hand. The horsetail
whisk in his hands immediately transformed into three thousand white
strands, filling the skies as they swept forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaaa!” The only
woman, Meng Liuqing, crushed a Dao-seal and let out a cold roar.
Bang! Countless rays of lightning appeared in midair, striking
downwards towards Ning and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, the six
Wanxiang Adepts had simultaneously used the most vicious techniques
available to them. They weren’t itinerant cultivators with no
secret arts at their disposals; they were mighty Daoists who had some
truly ancient, mysterious techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Three-Foot Sword] -
Manifold Thistlethorns!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly beautiful,
enormous blooming lotus flower spread open, with Ning and Northson
completely surrounded by it. Ning was holding the Darknorth swords in
his hands, just in case, but at the same time, he used the ninth
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to execute Ning’s
most powerful sword technique - the second stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpents Swallow the
Skies.” Northson’s two hands moved, and the giant, savage black
water-snakes that had latched onto each other’s tails suddenly
transformed into an enormous black circle. Carrying an inexhaustible,
terrifying devouring power, it swept forward.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_18___Sweeping_Through_Al"></A>
Chapter 18 - Sweeping Through All Opposition
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bolts of lightning
struck down at astonishing speed, instantly colliding with the
gigantic Waterflame Lotus surrounding Ning and Northson. The petals
of the Waterflame Lotus were blooming in layers, and after breaking
through three layers of petals, the lightning dissipated, completely
unable to harm Ning or Northson at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually broke
through three layers.” Ning was secretly shocked. In the past three
years, Ning had made the most accomplishments in the Dao of Rainwater
and the Dao of the Inferno. Every so often, he would go meditate
before the Black-White Diagram…and he was now capable of instantly
creating and maintaining six layers of petals. If the enemy’s
attacks were twice as powerful, they would’ve broken through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
surprised, he saw that the first attacks arriving from far away were
those nine tornado windmills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manifold
Thistlethorns!” The jade-white sword of light flew out at a
seemingly slow speed, as though it was being bound by countless
things, which it was just barely able to break through, one layer at
a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wherever the jade-white
sword of light flew past…the aura it brought with it was enough to
cause the faces of Northriver Zhou, Jihe, Dong One, and the other
Wanxiang Adepts to change, once they sensed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who the hell was it
that claimed Ji Ning is only skilled in close combat?!” Northriver
Zhou and the others were all cursing in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The impending
sword-light immediately chopped apart the impending dire-ice. Next,
it collided against the nine tornado windmills that were flying
through the air. Rumble…the nine tornado windmills had aroused an
endless tempest, and the nine had immediately formed into a formation
which jointly resisted that single jade-white sword of light, but the
sword was simply too fast. They could clearly sense it and see it,
but it’s speed vastly surpassed that of any of the windmills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few seconds after a
thunderous collision, the nine windmills were all knocked flying
away, but the jade-white sword-light had also grown incomparably dim.
“Crunch.” In front of the three thousand white strands of the
horsetail whisk, the jade-white sword light completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable. He was
actually able to first break through Dong One’s ‘dire-ice’,
then break the ‘Grand Windmill Formation’ of myself, Xu Manquan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he’s so
powerful when controlling sword-light…we absolutely cannot let him
get into close range!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northriver Zhou and the
others were all shocked. What they didn’t realize was that Ning
felt shocked as well. “My [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is
already essentially as powerful as an attack at the Zifu level can
be, and it executed the second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. And
yet, it was only just barely able to defeat two of their attacks? It
appears that my power base is too weak; Xu Manquan and Dong One are
both peak Wanxiang Adepts, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the two, one had
used dire-ice, something comparable to a divine ability; the other
had used a grand formation. And both were at the peak Wanxiang Adept
level! Despite that, both of their attacks had been defeated by Ning,
a single person. Actually, Ning’s performance was already quite
monstrous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpents Swallow the
Skies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anatta Sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two black serpents
with linked heads and tails had formed into an enormous circle, and
they swept towards those nine streaks of sword-light. As for the nine
rivers of sword-light controlled by Northriver Zhou, they swept
forward like nine mighty floods, wildly attacking that water-snake
circle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the moment, the
battle was actually at a stalemate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two of the
Black-White College truly are powerful. They are so much weaker than
us in terms of their base of power, but they are able to resist our
attacks nonetheless.” Dong One sent hurriedly with a shout,
“Everyone, work together and annihilate them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Liuqing, Nongsan,
and the others used their full strength, not daring to be the
slightest bit negligent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
realized that the gray energy flooding towards him actually was
capable of somewhat affecting the soul. Although he didn’t care
about it, due to the power of his soul, his junior apprentice-brother
would be affected by it. Indeed, the nearby Northson had a frown on
his face, and the power of the black serpent constructs which he was
controlling had begun to drop. Clearly, his mental equilibrium had
been affected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” Ning’s
eyes suddenly exploded with a terrifying killing intent. His divine
soul was seated in the lotus position deep within his sea of
consciousness. In front of his chest, an azure runic seal suddenly
formed; the Soulshaker Seal! His powerful divine sense poured out
through the Soulshaker Seal and spread out, thundering out like the
waves of the sea in multiple layered waves, surging rapidly towards
every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It completely avoided
the nearby Northson, crushing down towards everyone else. The rolling
waves of powerful divine sense instantly crashed against the six
Wanxiang Adepts surrounding them. It was as though mighty, savage
waves which had been building up power for a long time had suddenly
crashed against the shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The powerful divine
sense instantly exploded with inconceivable concussive power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is…” The
Wanxiang Adept of Snowdragon Mountain, Dong One, only felt a
terrifying collisive power smash towards him. He was instantly
terrified, but then…his mind went blank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These mighty Wanxiang
Adepts, in the face of Ning’s [Soulshaker Art], were instantly
stunned and dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the
[Soulshaker Art] was only a technique capable of shaking the
opponent’s soul and affecting their power. Generally speaking, it
wouldn’t cause others to fall into this dazed, stunned state. The
chief reason it did right now was because Ning’s divine soul had
already the ‘divine sense’ level. It was comparable to a Primal
Daoist using the technique; naturally, it caused them all to enter a
stupor. The six of them even began to slowly sink down from the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning willed
it, and instantly, the jade-white sword of light of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] appeared once more, sweeping towards the
enemies. “Junior apprentice-brother, hurry and attack,” Ning
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Northson realized that the six Wanxiang Adepts had entered a dazed,
stunned state as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first person to be
struck by the jade-white sword light was the leader, Northriver Zhou.
“BANG!” Northriver Zhou’s body suddenly unleashed a barrier of
sword-ki. This sword-ki was incomparably resilient, and it was able
to withstand Ning’s jade-white sword attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protective
sword-ki?” Ning was startled. “It must be a protective item which
the elders of his school provide him with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that he
was struck, Northriver Zhou came to his senses, and a look of terror
appeared on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
The jade-white sword-light of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
chopped three times in a row against that protective sword-ki.
Northriver Zhou, who had just come to his senses and didn’t have
the chance to begin controlling his magic treasures, was thus
bisected by Ning’s sword chop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack, crack,
crack…Northson’s black serpent-circle immediately crushed down
around the one named ‘Jihe’. This Jihe actually didn’t have a
protective item on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the other four
Wanxiang Adepts came to their senses. They were still late stage
Wanxiang Adepts and peak Wanxiang nAdepts, after all; their souls
were extremely strong, and their Dao-hearts resilient. Even for
Primal Daoists who used the [Soulshaker Art], to be able to send them
into a stupor for a moment was already impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. Jihe and
Northriver Zhou are already dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They know a powerful
divine will technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four lucky
survivors, being Dong One, Meng Liuqing, Nongsan, and Xu Manquan,
were all terrified and immediately fled. Two of them had died in an
instant; this extinguished any thoughts they had of fighting back.
They now understand that one of these two disciples of the
Black-White College was in possession of an extremely powerful divine
will technique. Still, they were also incomparably puzzled; although
divine will techniques were rare, they weren’t invincible. Only
someone with an extremely strong divine soul would be powerful when
using a divine will technique, and clearly, these two had only
trained for a short period of time. How could they be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee?” Ning let
out a cold laugh. BANG! His mighty divine will once more spread out
in every direction, like the crushing waves of the sea. Although all
of the four fleeing individuals were prepared this time, they were
still dazed by the powerful divine will, and their speed lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, kill them.” Ning, his Darknorth swords in his
hands, charged straight towards Dong One of Snowdragon Mountain. At
the same time, he controlled his sword-light of the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] to attack that Xu Manquan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Northson’s black serpent circle instantly broke apart, transforming
back into two giant water-snakes which attacked Nongsan and Meng
Liuqing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Soulshaker Art]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used the
[Soulshaker Art] yet again, and ripples of endless, ceaseless waves
of energy swept towards those four Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain,
eh? Die!” The Darknorth swords in Ning’s hands sliced out as two
streaks of light, bisecting Dong One. “BANG!” Dong One’s body
emanated a black energy which formed in protective layers, protecting
him like a cocoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Ning
launched yet another attack, but still wasn’t able to break
through. Dong One gritted his teeth, still under assault by the
clashing waves of Ning’s divine will. He gritted his teeth so hard
that blood came out from them, and his eyes were bloodshot and
crazed. He felt like a person who was drowning in a lake of waves of
divine will. However, his powerful Dao-heart caused him to want to
remain alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ignite!” Dong One,
just barely managing to remain conscious, executed the Blood Evasion
technique. Whoosh! A dazzling, bloody scarlet light suddenly appeared
in the skies, and then he disappeared into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish.” Xu
Manquan, pursued by the sword-light of Ning’s [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], had barely managed to remain conscious as well,
but he hadn’t been able to flee. He was killed by the sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One escaped.” Ning
shook his head, collecting the corpses that were falling down from
the skies. Ning turned to look. Northson was flying towards him.
Northson said resignedly, “Senior apprentice-brother, I let that
Meng Liuqing get away. However, I did kill that Nongsan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of six, we
killed four.” Ning laughed. “Not bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you mean,
‘not bad’? We did extremely well!” Northson stared at Ning in
astonishment. “Senior apprentice-brother, what technique did you
use just now? I saw them enter a dazed state. It should’ve been a
divine will technique, right? Our Black-White College only has three
divine will techniques; the [Soulshaker Art], the [Soulcharmer Art],
and the [Soulslayer Art]. Which one did you use?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Soulshaker
Art], of course.” Ning didn’t try to hide it. “Formidable,”
Northson said, “Formidable. Senior apprentice-brother, your soul is
at the divine sense level! The power of your [Soulshaker Art] is
astonishing; you were able to make them completely unable to fight
back. Actually, they were quite powerful; they were all roughly on
par with me.” Northson sighed in amazement. “I really haven’t
trained long enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what
they left behind,” Ning said. “Alright.” Northson was filled
with eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two first flew back
to the dragon-headed warship. The slaves aboard the dragon-headed
warship were all quite terrified; they had no idea what had just
happened outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson paid
them no heed. Instead, they began to hurriedly bind the storage-type
magic treasures. Although the four they had killed were Wanxiang
Adepts, their storage-type magic treasures weren’t all
Earth-ranked. Three were Mortal-ranked, while only one was
Earth-ranked. It actually didn’t make a huge difference if the
storage-type treasures were Earth-ranked or not; thus, not many
Immortal cultivators would actively go about upgrading them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, whose magic treasure was this? It has so much
liquefied elemental essence; this bottle has to have at least 250
kilograms!” Northson was instantly overjoyed upon discovering this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, upon hearing
this, was delighted as well. 250 kilograms? So much! Ning quickly
understood. “Most likely, after training to the peak of the
Wanxiang Adept level, he was preparing to use it to break through to
become a Primal Daoist. To break through to the Primal Daoist level
would require tremendous amounts of liquefied elemental essence. 250
kilograms is just a rounding error.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Makes sense.”
Northson nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning was quite
eager; they had discovered 250 kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence in the storage-type magic treasure of just a single Wanxiang
Adept. Perhaps, as a result of othis encounter, Ning would be able to
breakthrough to become a Wanxiang Adept himself!

Chapter 19 - Breakthrough, Wanxiang Adept
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Mu Northson
continued to bind the storage treasures to see what items the four
Wanxiang Adepts they had killed had left behind. Immortal cultivators
would often carry their most important treasures with them! This was
because it would be safest when they were holding onto them
personally. And, of course, if they were to die, the treasures would
become of no value to them. Thus, cultivators generally carried their
treasures with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve bound them
all.” Northson let out a long sigh. “All of them were quite
‘fat’,” Ning said with a laugh. “Killing a single cultivator
really is far more rewarding than killing a Wanxiang monster.”
Although Wanxiang monsters also relied on formations and alliances to
occasionally killed cultivators, they would generally trade those
magic treasures of the slain cultivators for liquefied elemental
essence and some particular items they needed. Thus, when Ning’s
group had killed those three Wanxiang monsters, they hadn’t
acquired that much from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northriver Zhou, Xu
Manquan, Nongsan, Jihe.” Northson sighed. “Most of them had
formation-type treasures. Those nine Earth-ranked flying swords of
Northriver Zhou…I imagine those are all Earth-ranked high-grade
flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “These were all fairly formidable figures amongst Wanxiang
Adepts. Their magic treasures are extraordinary.” The Adept Xu Li
who Ning had killed in the past had carried quite ordinary
Earth-ranked magic treasures. He was merely a low-level figure
amongst Wanxiang Adepts; by contrast, Northriver Zhou and the others
were top-level figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In total, 33
Earth-ranked magic treasures. No need to count the Mortal-ranked
ones. These treasures are most likely worth around 1000 or 1500
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.” Northson was quite
excited. “They also have Dao-seals like these Lesser Teleportation
Dao-seals, and some formations, spirit-pills…and liquefied
elemental essence! These four Wanxiang Adepts have, in total, 900
kilograms of it! Senior apprentice-brother, you are still at the peak
Zifu level; the liquefied elemental essence will be yours. With them,
I imagine you will be able to smash through to the early Wanxiang
stage at one blow. By then, your power will increase dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “No rush.
Junior apprentice-brother, you need to increase your power as well.”
But Northson shook his head, then said resignedly, “Even if you
gave me all 900 kilograms, it’s hard to say whether or not I’d be
able to break through to the late Wanxiang stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled, but
after thinking over it, he nodded slightly. Indeed, it would be hard
to say. When Immortal cultivators rose in power to a completely new
stage, the amount of elemental ki they would have to absorb would
also increase tenfold, or perhaps even tens of times. Although it
might only take 500 kilograms to go from the early Zifu stage to the
early Wanxiang stage, from the early Wanxiang stage, it might take
tens of thousands of kilograms to reach the early Primal Daoist
stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The early Primal Daoist
stage, in turn, would probably need hundreds upon hundreds of
thousands of kilograms in order to reach the early Earth Immortal
stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands vs
hundreds of thousands? How incredible was this? Even major schools or
sects would at most be willing to squander a bit of liquefied
elemental essence on powerful Zifu-stage disciples. Once they reached
the Wanxiang Adept or Primal Daoist stages…one had to simply train
slowly. Even some truly supreme, monstrous geniuses would at most be
given a bit of help by their clans. It would be incredible for the
clans to be willing to part with a few tens of thousands of
kilograms. Hundreds of thousands of kilograms? Not even Immortals
would be able to bring out that much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, hurry up and make your breakthrough,” Northson
urged. “Once you break through to the early Wanxiang stage, the
rate at which you are able to absorb elemental ki will explosively
increase by tens of times. By then, a single year’s worth of
training would probably be equivalent to using hundreds of kilograms
of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, then.” Ning
nodded. “I’ll accept the liquefied elemental essence, but you
take the magic treasures, junior apprentice-brother.” Northson
said, delighted, “Fine, fine, fine. I won’t refuse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two made a simple
division; the various magic treasures would go to Northson, while the
liquefied elemental essence went to Ning. As for the Dao-seals,
spirit-pills, and other items, the two divided them equally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it seemed as
though Northson was at a bit of advantage in terms of value, these
were the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, after all; if he was to
trade for liquefied elemental essence, he would first have to go back
to the Crimson Dragon Mountains. Thus…comparatively speaking, Ning
was a bit better off. Ning understood this, and he quietly memorized
this event.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Up ahead is the
place where the Raindragon Guard is stationed.” Ning walked to the
helm of the warship, staring through the sparse clouds to the distant
lands below. “After we deliver these slaves to them, we’ll find a
place where I can quietly absorb this liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon Guard
encampment within the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. This was a
towering mountain, and there were estates erected throughout it.
Quite a few Raindragon Guards were present here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship hovered there in midair, slowly drawing closer to the
mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and depart.”
A black-robed elder stood there in midair, appearing in front of the
dragon-headed warship. He said furiously, “The two of you have come
here to participate in the trial to join the Raindragon Guard. You
are forbidden from entering. After you enter this encampment, you
will have failed the test.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
immediately saluted with respect. They could sense that this
black-robed elder’s aura…seemed quite similar to the aura the
Primal Daoists of the Black-White College possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning [Mu
Northson] greets you, senior,” the two said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point in being
respectful. Hurry up and depart.” The black-robed elder waved his
arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning persisted in
saying, “Senior, we haven’t come here to enter the encampment.
We’ve come because earlier, when we two brothers went to deal with
Wanxiang monsters atop a monster mountain, we discovered a group of
pitiable humans who were being raised as livestock. Thus, we
delivered them here in the hopes that the Raindragon Guard will take
pity on and care of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed elder
was startled. A look of rage appeared on his face. “These
monsters…they never learn the error of their ways.” He looked
towards Ning and Northson with a slightly kinder look in his eyes
now. “Bring these slaves out. Release them and let me look at
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning and
Northson said respectfully. Instantly, they opened the doors to the
warship, and the group of slaves that had been eating and drinking
within the warm cabins stared outwards in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look on the
black-robed elder’s face grew even uglier to behold, upon seeing
those human slaves clad in leaves and in bark, who had terrified
looks in their eyes. He let out a soft sigh. “There is no hope for
most of these slaves. Some of the children, perhaps. These humans who
were treated as meat by the monsters…their lives are incomparably
terrible, generation after generation. Now that they have escaped
their tribulations, the Raindragon Guard will naturally take care of
them. Hand them over to me. The two of you shall continue within the
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. After three months time, you may
return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning and
Northson were both overjoyed. Previously, they were afraid that the
Raindragon Guard wouldn’t take care of them, but now, it seemed,
the Raindragon Guard was quite benevolent towards these human slaves
who had been reared as livestock by the monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later. The
black-robed Primal Daoist elder had led away all the human slaves.
The child who Ning and Northson was the most familiar with, the one
called ‘Ironboy’, had stared at the two of them the entire time,
as though wanting to completely memorize their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what will
happen to him in the future,” Northson said softly, a complicated
look in his eyes. “Everyone has their own destiny,” Ning said.
“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two disciples once
more boarded the dragon-headed warship, quickly departing the
encampment region and beginning to once more head deep into the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later. It
was already night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson had
chosen a desolate mountain with no monsters present. Ning’s divine
sense had inspected the entire mountain, but hadn’t found any
monsters at all. Thus, they entered a cave which was deep within the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the cave, there
was a flowing underground river. The two set up a grand alarm
formation, and Northson also arranged for some constructs to stand
guard alongside himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, focus on your training. Leave everything here to
me. I won’t even let an ant crawl in,” Northson chortled. Ning
laughed. “Sorry for the trouble, junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, no longer
thinking about anything else, Ning immediately sat down into the
lotus position atop a flat rock he had chopped apart with his
Darknorth sword. A jade bottle appeared next to him. Within this jade
bottle was the liquefied elemental essence of all four Wanxiang
Adepts; a total of 900 kilograms of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew!” Ning opened
his mouth, and the liquefied elemental essence began to flow out,
directly entering Ning’s mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s Zifu
Violet Palace region. The liquefied elemental essence began to
frantically transform. His entire Zifu Sea was swiveling slightly,
because at the very base of the Zifu Sea large amount of pure
elemental ki was flowing out from the Watersource. The Zifu Sea…it
continuously expanded in each direction, taking up more and more of
the space in this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">50 kilograms. 150
kilograms. 250 kilograms. 300 kilograms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
absorb more and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Previously, in
the Black-White College, I absorbed 405 kilograms. Afterwards, I
spent three years in training. Those three years should be roughly
equivalent to fifty or a hundred kilograms as well. In other words,
my body should’ve had nearly 500 kilograms.” Ning pondered to
himself. “And now, I’ve absorbed 300 more, but I still haven’t
reached my limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait and
see. I want to see exactly how much my Zifu Lake can expand to.”
Ning didn’t hesitate at all, continuing to ceaselessly absorb
liquefied elemental essence. The Zifu Sea within his body was
constantly expanding, taking up more of the space of the void. The
entire Zifu Violet Palace region was growing sturdier and sturdier as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">350 kilograms. 400
kilograms. 450 kilograms…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s previous
guess was that I would roughly need to absorb around 800 to 850
kilograms or so, but I’ve already…wow, a thousand kilograms.”
Ning’s former Zifu Sea had held roughly 500 kilograms worth of
liquefied elemental essence, but now he had absorbed 500 more. And
yet, Ning still didn’t feel as though he had reached his limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Continue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the rate at
which his Zifu Sea expanded began to slow down, as though it was
beginning to reach its limits. The surrounding void had begun to
generate a shocking resistive power, preventing the Zifu Sea from
expanding much more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Violet
Palace was beginning to tremble. The Zifu Lake was no longer able to
expand by another inch. The entire Violet Palace region was now
incomparably sturdy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
his Zifu Sea had finally reached its limits. Factoring in his
previous accumulated energy and this time’s absorption…he had
actually taken in the equivalent of 1250 kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, my
peak Zifu stage is definitely at a true peak now,” Ning mused
silently to himself. “I can now break through to the early Wanxiang
stage.” Actually, he could’ve broken through three years ago, but
his base wasn’t stable and solid enough. Ning was a person of great
ambition; naturally, he had insisted on waiting until today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to mentally
recite the words from the [Flowing Watersource] describing the
process of breaking through to the Wanxiang Adept stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought…his
entire Zifu Sea began to change…

Chapter 20 - Manifestation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ji Ning’s Zifu
Violet Palace. The boundless sea of elemental ki was vast and
endless. With but a thought from Ning, the surface of the entire sea
of elemental ki began to sink downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the sea of
elemental ki. A large amount of elemental ki essence was quickly,
continuously condensing. One enormous star after another was
constantly being born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After an indeterminate
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the surface of
the sea of elemental ki had already sank downwards considerably.
Suddenly, it began to roil, and one enormous star after another
slowly rose up from above it, breaking through the surface and
floating upwards. Countless giant, tightly packed stars emerged from
the surface of the sea, flying higher and higher into the void, each
of them gleaming with faint light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rising. Rising.
Finally, the countless stars came to a halt, high in the vast,
infinite ‘sky’. In this moment, true darkness came to the Zifu.
Those countless, brilliant stars hung there in the night sky, and
beneath the night sky was the vast, endless sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the very first
Manifestation after one broke through to the Wanxiang level - a sea
of stars in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the sea of
elemental ki continued to sink downwards. In the center of the sea,
where a countless amount of elemental ki essence had condensed, an
even more astonishingly large ‘star’ was being formed. After
another indeterminate period of time, this unfathomably larger ‘star’
slowly began to rise upwards as well. Eventually, it broke through
the waves and slowly floated into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This rose in a manner
which was different from the countless stars which had just soared
upwards. In this moment, it was as though the only thing thing which
existed in the night sky was this incomparably vast ‘star’. It
emanated a soft, gentle light which illuminated the entire night sky,
and which shone down on the entire sea of elemental ki. In this
moment, it was the most brilliant part of the entire Zifu region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was evidence of a
breakthrough to the second Manifestation of the Wanxiang level - the
bright moon ascending from the sea!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, this enormous,
brilliant moon came to a halt, high in the sky. In this moment, there
was a sea of stars in the sky, along with a luminous moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the sea of
elemental ki continued to sink. If the sea of elemental ki had been
too small, perhaps even the creation of a sea of thousands of stars
would be impossible. If even that was impossible…then that
symbolized that there was no hope for a breakthrough to the Wanxiang
level. Since the likes of Adept Mu Xiao and Adept Xu Li trained in
what could only be considered decent techniques, when they made their
breakthroughs, they were only able to reach this second
Manifestation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning’s sea of
elemental ki was now incomparably vast. Although it had continuously
sank downwards for a long period of time, less than 30% of the sea
had been drained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…an
even more incomparably enormous ‘star’ was forming, deep in the
bottom of the sea. Even before being truly born, this ‘star’ was
already beginning to emit an astonishing, blinding brilliance, to the
point where even the entire sea of elemental ki was beginning to
glow. Finally, it too began to rise, and this titanic ‘star’ rose
upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, it broke
through the surface of the water. In that instant, the scorching,
blazing light of this star instantly spread out, covering the
entirety of the Zifu with its light. The Zifu space instantly
transformed from night into day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This great sun slowly,
unhurriedly rose into the heights of the sky. This was proof that one
had broken through to the third Manifestation of the Wanxiang level -
the dawn sun rising from the east!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea of stars, the
bright moon rising from the sea, the dawn sun rising from the
east…the appearance of these three Manifestations symbolized that
this breakthrough to the Wanxiang level had been a perfect one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sun flew to
the highest part of the entire region, it became surrounded by stars.
It was located directly opposite to the nearby moon. One Yang, the
other Yin. Because it had flown so high, the light of the sun was no
longer as scorchingly powerful as it had been before. The bright
moon, the blazing sun; one cool, the other blazing. Two different
types of light filled the sea below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense!” Ning
willed it. The entire sea of elemental ki, which had only sunk by
less than half, began to frantically sink at an even faster rate. As
it did, spots of light began to float up from the sea of elemental
ki. These countless spots of light broke through the surface and
floated upwards…and as the sea of elemental ki continued to sink,
more and more spots of light emerged. They were so densely packed and
numerous as to be countless; there were hundreds, no, thousands more
spots of light than there were stars in the sky. They all flew up
into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These spots of light
flew towards the stars, the moon, and the sun, then merged into them.
The moon, the sun, and the countless stars began to increase in size.
And, as they absorbed those spots of light, the moon, the sun, and
the stars also began to evolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time the sea of
elemental ki had sank down to 10% of its original size, everything
finally came to a halt. The moon, sun, and stars in the sky had
increased by a full size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
finally relaxed. The stars in the sky began to slowly move about. At
first, they moved about in a very slow, sluggish manner. Soon,
however, they began to move in a very natural, easy way, and they
began to revolve around the two larger stellar bodies, the sun and
the moon. The movement of the countless stars was natural and innate.
These stars and the sun and the moon were naturally linked with the
countless true stellar bodies in the outside world, and thus they
began to move in this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the deep cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson turned his
head to look at Ning. Ning still sat there in the lotus position, but
he had stopped absorbing liquefied elemental essence. “Senior
apprentice-brother should have made his breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
suddenly, a large amount of natural elemental ki from the surrounding
area began to wildly surge towards Ning at an incomparably shocking
speed. Moments later, this elemental ki ripple came to a halt. Ning
opened his eyes. Laughing loudly, he rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
senior apprentice-brother. You have stepped into the Wanxiang level,”
Northson said in delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I made some tests
just now. Indeed, it is as you said, junior apprentice-brother; upon
breaking through to the Wanxiang level, the stars within the Zifu in
my body truly do resonate with the countless real stars of the
outside world. Once I begin to absorb the elemental ki of the outside
world, the rate at which that happens has increased by many tens of
times.” Ning laughed, but at the same time, he sighed in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one wanted to create
liquefied elemental essence, it would be far more difficult. If one
wanted to do that, then one would need to do what Immortal Firedragon
had done; set down a grand formation, then spend a long period of
time converting the elemental ki of the natural world and distill it
into liquefied elemental essence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, liquefied
elemental essence was naturally, incomparably precious. Wanxiang
Adepts and Primal Daoists would rather spend a bit of extra time in
training than use it; extremely few were able to wantonly use vast
amounts of liquefied elemental essence to rise in power quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you broke through to the Wanxiang level; you
should be lacking in suitable Earth-ranked magic treasures.”
Northson laughed. “Earlier, we acquired a set of flying swords from
that Northriver Zhou. It should suit you very well. This set of
flying swords shall be your junior apprentice-brother’s gift to you
for making your breakthrough, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. “No,
I can’t!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northriver Zhou’s set
of flying swords? Indeed, it really was a set of nine Earth-ranked
flying swords, and they were quite good as well, most likely
high-grade Earth-ranked swords. Although the current core of his
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], the ‘Nine Yang Sword
Formation’, was comprised of top-grade Mortal-ranked swords, for a
Wanxiang Adept…they were still vastly inferior to a set of nine
quality Earth-ranked flying swords. The comparative price of these
items testified to this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Top-grade Mortal-ranked
flyinig swords would generally go for a hundred taels of liquefied
elemental essence, which was to say, around five kilograms. This set
of Earth-ranked flying swords of Northriver Zhou, however, would
probably see each sword going for nearly fifty kilograms. Since the
nine came in a set, most likely if sold as a set, a price of five
hundred kilograms or so could be fetched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother. These flying swords are useless to me.”
Northson shook his head. “This is my congratulatory gift…can it
be that you are going to refuse, senior apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at
Northson, then smiled. “Fine, then. I’ll accept this set of
flying swords.” The two were fellow disciples, and they were
engaged in a life-and-death adventure together. Ning wasn’t going
to be wishy-washy about it; only, he firmly engraved this moment into
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed. In
the blink of an eye, it had been half a month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clouds drifted
forward in the sky. A dragon-headed warship was leisurely advancing.
Up ahead, a spatial distortion could be seen, as well as cracks and
tears in space. Beyond those cracks was a gray, blurry void. Although
Ning and Northson had seen these things many times now, they still
felt their hearts beat in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship naturally stayed far, far away from these things. If they
were accidentally trapped within these spatial distortions…Ning
understood that given their current level of power, they would
definitely die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This set of flying
swords truly is sharp and dominating. It has an extremely strong
murderous intent about it.” Ning stood at the helm of the ship. He
stretched his right hand out, and around his right hand were nine
finger-sized flying swords. These nine flying swords swirled around
Ning’s right hand, constantly spinning…and occasionally spitting
out sword-light. Ning was still familiarizing himself with this set
of nine Earth-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he didn’t
know the name of these swords, Ning described them as the ‘Northriver
Sword Formation’. Both because it had belonged to Northriver Zhou,
and also to constantly remind himself to be warry of other Immortal
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, look.” Northson pointed towards the distance.
Ning took a careful look. In the foggy distance, a warship was
currently flying towards them. Upon seeing the shape of the warship,
Ning immediately said, “This is one of the hundred who took part in
the Raindragon Guard trial. This is the ship of the peak Wanxiang
Adept named ‘Formless’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formless?”
Northson turned to look as well. “It’s not going to be like when
we met Northriver Zhou and the others, is it? There aren’t other
Wanxiang Adepts hiding on his ship, are there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
Ning willed his divine sense to sweep forward, thoroughly surrounding
the distant warship. Ning thoroughly investigate all the activities
going on inside that ship. After doing so, Ning relaxed. “It’s
not bad. Including Adept Formless, there are only two
individuals…eh?” Ning’s face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that distant
warship. The white-robed ‘Daoist Eastdawn’ and the gray-robed
‘Daoist Formless’ were also staring towards Ning’s distant
dragon-headed warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That dragon-headed
warship should belong to that disciple of the Black-White College, Mu
Northson,” the gray-robed Daoist Formless said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from how
leisurely they are acting, and how slow they are flying…I imagine
they must have acquired the corpse of a Wanxiang monster long ago,”
Daoist Eastdawn said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are members of
the Black-White College, after all.” Daoist Formless frowned, then
shook his head. “It’s unfortunate. When we first entered the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains, our luck wasn’t bad. We even killed
a Wanxiang monster! But afterwards, ever since we acted against that
Azure Skysnake, our luck has taken a turn for the worse. We failed
numerous times. Three days ago, we were played for idiots by that
Azure Skysnake, and the two of us nearly died there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Eastdawn gritted
his teeth. “The first time, we let her escape. The second time,
after she discovered us, she actually played us for fools and let us
fall into a trap. If we run into her again, I’ll definitely kill
her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake?”
Ning had a sudden thought. In the past, shortly after he had left the
protection of his parents, he had gone adventuring in a region within
ten thousand kilometers of West Prefecture City. He had battled
numerous times with an Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning had killed
Ironwood Zhan, he had been unable to discover the corpse of the Azure
Skysnake. Back then, he had suspected that it must have suddenly
comprehended the ‘Void Blink’ technique and fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnakes are
still quite rare. In addition, due to their innate gifts, they
generally grow quite quickly,” Ning mused to himself. “I wonder
if the Azure Skysnake they met…is the same one I met in the Swallow
Mountain region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, let’s move towards them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move towards them?”
Northson looked towards Ning, who nodded. Northson no longer asked
anything, instead moving the dragon-headed warship closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared into the
distance. He wanted to learn more information about this Azure
Skysnake from these two men. Since he had nothing to do during the
next two-plus months in the wild marshes, he might as well go
investigate and see if this Azure Skysnake was the same one he knew.

Chapter 21 - Meeting Again After Many Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Mu
Northson.” Adept Formless, on the other warship, clasped his hands,
then said with a laugh, “Oh, fellow Daoist Ji Ning is here as well.
For us to be able to meet here in the wild marshes is truly a karmic
sign. After we return to the Raindragon Guard encampment, we must
have a good reunion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally! Fellow
Daoist Formless, fellow Daoist Eastdawn,” Ning said, clasping his
hands, “Judging from how relaxed you see, I imagine that you must
have already acquired enough Wanxiang monster corpses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relaxed?” The two
Wanxiang Adepts on the warship opposite from them stared at each
other. Daoist Eastdawn couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. “Fellow
Daoist Ji Ning, what makes you feel we are relaxed? Just a short
while ago, we nearly died. We are just taking a short rest, and then
we’ll go hunting for Wanxiang monsters again. After all, the time
limit is three months; we have a bit of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, you haven’t
collected enough either?” Ning was ‘surprised’. “Either?”
Daoist Eastdawn was truly surprised. “Can it be that the two you
have yet to collect enough either?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Northson was
puzzled by why Ning had said this, he nodded and said in support,
“Right, not yet.” Ning sighed. “Actually, this time, we nearly
killed an Azure Skysnake. Only, that Azure Skysnake was too slippery;
she managed to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake? You
also encountered an Azure Skysnake?” Daoist Eastdawn was shocked.
Ning instantly looked towards him, ‘puzzled’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Eastdawn said
hurriedly, “We met her as well, a total of two times. This Azure
Skysnake truly is sly and slippery; to kill her won’t be easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did you meet
her?” Ning asked. Daoist Eastdawn didn’t try to hide anything.
“The first time was in the north, roughly two hundred thousand
kilometers from here. Three days ago, we met her again, roughly a
hundred thousand kilometers northeast of here, at the ‘Mount
Demonlotus’ region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head and
sighed. “We really are linked by karmic. We both encountered the
Azure Skysnake. However, I don’t know if it was the same one. Well.
We two brothers need to continue to search for Wanxiang monsters, so
we won’t dally. Once we return to the encampment, we can meet
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Daoist
Formless and Daoist Eastdawn clasped their hands in salute. Soon, the
two warships separated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Formless, aboard
his ship, laughed. “That was such a coincidence. They encountered
the Azure Skysnake as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was actually
worried that there might be other Wanxiang Adepts hiding within that
dragon-headed warship, preparing for an ambush,” Daoist Eastdawn
said. “But now, it seems, disciples of the Black-White College
really are different. They are quite proud, and they won’t stoop to
doing such things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It’s the
Black-White College, after all,” Daoist Formless agreed, nodding.
They actually had been vigilant this entire time. However, chatting
about the Azure Skysnake didn’t impact them at all; naturally, they
didn’t mind discussing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the
dragon-headed warship. “We’re going to the Mount Demonlotus
region?” Northson looked towards Ning, puzzled. “Senior
apprentice-brother, why are we going to Mount Demonlotus?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my homeland, I
once battled numerous times against a Xiantian-level Azure Skysnake
monster. After having fought so many times, we actually ended up with
something of a friendship.” Ning sighed. “Only, afterwards, it
most likely left the Swallow Mountain region, heading to unknown
places. Now that I heard of an Azure Skysnake appearing here…I want
to go and see if it’s the one I knew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Northson now
understood. “Azure Skysnakes are Godbeasts, and very rare Godbeasts
at that. Given how rare they are, it just might be the same one you
met in your homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It also might not
be,” Ning said. “But since we have nothing to do, we might as
well go there to take a look.” Northson nodded. “Alright.” He
immediately controlled the dragon-headed warship to fly towards the
north, then pursed his lips and said, “Come, senior
apprentice-brother. Tell me the story about you and that Azure
Skysnake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well, I’ll
tell you about it.” Ning began to slowly narrate that tale from
many years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Demonlotus. This
was a mountain that took up tens of kilometers of the surrounding
region, and was shaped like a blooming lotus flower. Supposedly, this
peak was a very mysterious one…no one who entered was able to
leave. The monsters of this region, at least, did not dare to enter
Mount Demonlotus at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mount Demonlotus
region took up an enormous amount of space. Because the natural
elemental aura of this location was exceptionally dense and
nourishing, it attracted quite a few monsters, who took up residence
in the various mountain peaks of the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a place of
many monsters, much elemental energy, and many treasures! Naturally,
the Azure Skysnake had prepared to make this place her home as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a desolate part of
the Mount Demonlotus region, one enormous formation-flag after
another began to appear in multiple places, covering a region of over
a hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!” A small
azure snake hung there in midair, staring about. Its tail flashed,
and it transformed into a streak of light, wanting to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake! Even
now, you want to try and flee?” This voice boomed like thunder.
From far away, in front of one of the formation flags, a ten-meter
tall, azure-skinned man had appeared. This muscular man’s eyes
glowed with a dark green light, and he had a heaven-shaking aura
around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake,
surrender and allow yourself to be captured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop struggling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you resist, you
will die an even more miserable death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One voice after another
rang out. In each of the formation flag locations, figures began to
appear, all of them with monstrous auras that filled the heavens.
There was an alluring, white-furred woman, a shockingly savage black
monster, a tall, skinny, evil-looking man…more than ten Wanxiang
monsters had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The little azure snake
swept the surrounding area with her gaze, and then her body blurred
before transforming into a ruby-lipped, ivory-toothed, azure-robed
maiden. Worry on her face, she hurriedly said, “You should be King
Dragonwhale.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am indeed.” The
ten-meter tall, azure-skinned man’s voice rumbled like thunder.
This monster, Dragonwhale, was extremely famous in the Mount
Demonlotus region. This was a monster who trained as a Fiendgod Body
Refiner, and who even had a divine ability. There were dozens of
Wanxiang monsters who served him. Not even human Immortal cultivators
would be so foolish as to try and act against this Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know how a
humble monster like myself offended you, your Majesty, for you to
come deal with me in such an awe-inspiring manner,” the azure-robed
maiden said, panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just yesterday, you
killed my lifelong friend.” The Dragonwhale monster’s eyes glowed
with a shockingly powerful light. The azure-robed maiden was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That
Zifu-level panther-headed monster was my lifelong friend.” The
Dragonwhale monster’s eyes were filled with a savage, killing
intent. “The two of us knew each other back when we were both
ordinary little monsters. It has been countless years…I didn’t
expect he’d fall to your hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” the
azure-robed maiden said, panicked, “I didn’t…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop dissembling,”
the Dragonwhale said coldly. “You killed my lifelong friend. I will
definitely let you know what it means to be in such agony that you
would wish to die. Everyone…capture her alive. I will use
ki-sealing chains to bind her, then viciously torture her for ten or
a hundred years. Only in this way can I give vent to my hatred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, don’t
worry at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten-plus Wanxiang
monsters began to surround her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to kill me?
In your dreams!” That azure-robed maiden, a look of panic still on
her face, suddenly roared in rage. With a swoosh, she transformed
into a small azure snake once more, then immediately fled at high
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” The
Dragonwhale watched emotionlessly. The ten-plus Wanxiang monsters
surrounded her, moving towards her in an enveloping manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dragonwhale
really is insidious. It actually set up a spacelock formation in this
region, making me unable to Void Blink.” The little azure serpent
cursed to itself. “It seems this time, I’m really in danger. The
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains truly are a dangerous place; my
senior fellow disciples spoke the truth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although she had
apprenticed herself to a monster Immortal, that monster Immortal
accepted many monsters; virtually no monsters would be refused.
Although she, an Azure Skysnake, was viewed with comparative
importance, if she were to be attacked or killed in the outside world
while adventuring, no one would help make an appearance on her
behalf. Amongst monsters…life was far more savage and ruthless than
life was amongst humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Azure Skysnake
really is slippery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although she cannot
Void Blink, her speed is still astonishingly fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dire-ice! She
actually was nourishing dire-ice. Everyone, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The small azure snake,
while fleeing, would immediately belch forth a blast of dire-ice when
any Wanxiang monsters moved to gang up on her! Dire-ice, for Wanxiang
Daoists, was not at all inferior to divine abilities; they were
extremely powerful supportive techniques. Against weaker opponents,
this dire-ice was capable of freezing them to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even against strong
opponents, the incomparable cold of ‘dire-ice’ would cause them
to be affected by the chilling cold. Their speed would be
dramatically lessened, and their power would fall as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be able
to continue emitting dire-ice for much longer. Soon, there will be
none left in her body.” The Dragonwhale watched from far away. As
the saying goes, spectators view things with the greatest clarity.
“All you need to do is continue to shrink the zone in which she can
flee towards. That will guarantee that she will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do.
What should I do. What should I do!” The Azure Skysnake, suffering
the combined attacks of so many, had to rely on the dire-ice to
impact them and slow them down, as well as her own innate nimbleness
and speed to escape them time and time again. However, clearly, under
the combined attacks of more than ten monsters, the region in which
she could flee about was rapidly shrinking. If this continued…she
would definitely be captured alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The little
azure snake’s tail flickered as fast as lightning, striking against
the sharp claws of an enormous white fox. The two were both knocked
backwards by the collision. The little azure snake’s tail flickered
once again, sending her into a solitary arc and fleeing in another
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still running?”
The giant white fox’s slanted eyes were filled with ridicule. “You
won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Boom!”
“Wham!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake was
forced to exchange multiple blows with these monsters. As a Godbeast,
the Azure Skysnake had incredible tools at her disposal, and in a
one-on-one fight, she would be able to withstand them. However, the
enemies comprised more than ten Wanxiang monsters, several of which
were stronger than her. And there was also that Dragonwhale monster
who had yet to join in; he vastly outstripped her in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
this time, I really am going to die.” The Azure Skysnake had this
sudden thought spring to her mind; today, perhaps, she really
wouldn’t be able to escape. She looked at the distant Dragonwhale,
who was still staring at her coldly. She gritted her teeth. “I’d
rather die than allow myself to be taken alive. Even if I die, I’ll
pull a few of them down with me to pad my grave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake went
berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the clouds above the
Mount Demonlotus region. A dragon-headed warship was slowly
advancing. Ning had already spent roughly half a month in this
region, but he had yet to locate the Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how large the
Mount Demonlotus region is, it is simply too hard to find an Azure
Skysnake. In addition, it might have left this region long ago,”
Northson said. Ning nodded. “Perhaps it really has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly,
Ning frowned and stared downwards. “A ripple.” Northson sensed it
as well. When Wanxiang monsters battled against each other, the
elemental ki ripples they created were extremely strong. Ning was
able to vaguely sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look,” Ning said. “Alright.” Northson immediately commanded the
warship to quickly draw closer. As they moved closer, the ripples
grew more and more intense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right there.”
Northson pointed downward, through the faint fog. Through it, they
could see that a massive battle was going on in the wilderness, with
the auras of that battle surging towards the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced downwards.
“They should be Wanxiang-level monsters. I’ll take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning sent his divine sense to cover the region, sweeping towards the
battle going on in that desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - Lil Snakey-Snake, Don’t You Recognize Me?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it?” Mu
Northson stood next to Ji Ning. Ning’s divine sense enveloped the
lower area. He was naturally able to see with perfect clarity the
little azure snake struggling for her life. The enraged, desperate,
despairing look in the eyes of the little azure serpent…upon seeing
it, Ning was instantly certain. “That’s the one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in the appearance of every snake, in terms of scale pattern,
coloration, eyes…there were minute differences in many areas. It
was much like how, although humans all had two eyes, a nose, and a
mouth, because of certain micro-differences, every single person was
unique and different from others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But those formation
flags…” Ning’s divine sense sweep discovered that there were
formation flags fixed into the ground in an area of a hundred
kilometers. Ning could be considered to be quite skilled in
formations now. “These are sealing formations; they should be used
to lock space.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Wanxiang
monsters really set up a watertight scheme; even if the Azure
Skysnake escapes their assaults, the formation flags can also form an
enormous sealing formation, preventing it from charging out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thoughts were flashing
through Ning’s mind at lightning speed. “Junior
apprentice-brother,” Ning sent mentally. “Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson looked at Ning. “That Azure
Skysnake below us is the one I am looking for. I’m planning to save
it. Want to come with me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Need you ask?”
Northson laughed. “Then let’s charge down right now,” Ning
said. “Let’s charge into that grand sealing formation. Otherwise,
once it activates, because of its spacelock function…we won’t
even be able to enter with a Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson nodded as
well. Swoosh! The dragon-headed warship suddenly shrank, and its
coloration changed as well, becoming the same color as the skies. And
then, it transformed into a blurry streak of light, shooting directly
towards the battle in the wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” A golden
metal rod slammed directly onto the Azure Skysnake’s body. The
Azure Skysnake rolled away from it, dodging far away, but at the same
time it vomited out a mouthful of jade-green blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, I’m
really going to die here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really want to go
back to Swallow Mountain…” This thought suddenly flashed through
the little azure snake’s mind. But then, it transformed into a
streak of light, pouncing towards the white-furred fox, sending a
mighty surge of dire-ice straight towards the white-furred fox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sudden, explosive
roar rang out. The Dragonwhale monster, who had only been watching
this entire time, without intervening, suddenly stared into the
distance and let out a mighty roar. And then, with a thought, the
formation flags that had been placed in the four directions all
instantly lit up. An enormous glowing barrier appeared out of
nowhere, completely covering this region for a hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, an extremely
small, dragon-headed warship had already charged into the sealed-off
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The little
azure snake glanced sideways as well, seeing the the distant warship
fly in, and the grand sealing formation suddenly appear. “Who
barged in? For the sake of capturing me alive, this Dragonwhale has
truly made meticulous preparations. These formation flags have
actually sealed this region in. Even if I throw off these monsters, I
still won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A human Immortal
cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wanxiang monsters
all noticed the warship that had charged in. By now, it had
disappeared, with two human youths flying out of it. Although they
appeared to be young, these monsters didn’t lessen their caution.
The younger an Immortal cultivator appeared to be, the more worthy of
caution they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qushan, block them.”
The Dragonwhale ordered one of the Wanxiang monsters under his
command with the most formidable life-preserving techniques to go
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Bowing,
an ugly man covered in armor strode forward, his steps causing the
earth to shake as it charged towards Ning and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew forward,
he mentally summoned 720 flying swords out of nowhere, with the core
being the nine Earth-ranked flying swords of the ‘Northriver Sword
Formation’. At the same time, the sun, moon, and countless stars of
the Zifu region within his body began to resonate with the outside
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the
surrounding skies suddenly transformed into a sea of glittering
stars, with a brilliant sun and a moon within them. This was a
Wanxiang Adept’s Manifestation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of Ji Ning’s
chest, a jade-white sword of light had already appeared. When Ning
had faced the combined attacks of Northriver Zhou and the others, he
had dared to use the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] to deal with the attacks of two peak Wanxiang Adepts at
once. Now that his elemental ki had also reached the early Wanxiang
stage, and the core of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had the
‘Nine Yang Sword Formation’ had been replaced with the
‘Northriver Sword Formation’, it could be said that the sword
formation Ning was using today could’ve defeated all six members of
Northriver Zhou’s party!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and flee,
and I’ll spare your life.” Ning flew forward, as fast as
lightning, while calling out in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny human child,
you really know how to waggle your tongue.” The hoarse voice of the
ugly man rang out as he lifted up two golden metal rods, transforming
into a shadow as he charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“You sought out your own death! Go!” With but a thought, Ning
instantly transformed the jade-white sword of light in front of his
chest into an enormous Waterflame Millstone which moved as fast as
the wind, spinning towards the ugly man. With the support of his
Wanxiang Manifestation…this sword became even more unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta block.” The
ugly man was badly frightened. This human kid’s flying sword was
incredibly fast! “Double block!” The ugly man twirled his two
metal rods, struggling to block, but in terms of skill alone, how
could the monster be a match for Ning, who had already embarked on
the path of the Sword Immortal? Even the likes of Northriver Zhou
would be capable of completely suppressing this ugly monster, much
less the current Ji Ning. This ugly monster was only skilled in
preserving his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light flashed
past the defense of the two golden metal rods, chopping directly onto
the body of the ugly man. With a slashing sound, his body was
instantly bisected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ugly man’s body,
upon being chopped in half, instantly dissolved into mist, then
reformed into an enormous black-shelled turtle. It hurriedly
retreated far away. This sight caused the other Wanxiang monsters to
all be shocked. Even the Dragonwhale, who had been standing apart
from the battle this entire time, to frown as he looked towards the
two human youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale waved
his hand and said, “Halt!” The other Wanxiang monsters all
immediately halted, moving backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, it
seems those two human youths are fairly powerful. That slightly
taller one was actually able to chop second brother Qushan in half.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you mean,
chopped in half? That’s because I was in human form, which was why
he was able to easily chop me in half. In my true form…how could he
be able to chop through?” The giant, black-shelled turtle flew
over, snapping irritably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You couldn’t even
block a single sword. You really are useless,” a tall, skinny
monster said with a cold snicker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you
try!” The black-shelled turtle was furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, shut
your mouths.” The Dragonwhale swept them with his gaze, and the
ten-plus Wanxiang monsters no longer dared to say anything. All of
them stared towards the distant Ji Ning and Mu Northson, who were
flying towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale said in
a clear voice, “Human, it’s best if you don’t interfere in the
matters of us monsters. You had best leave right away. I will release
the grand sealing formation and let you leave. If you don’t leave…”
The green light in the Dragonwhale monster’s eyes appeared quite
insidious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson just
glanced at the monsters, then turned their gazes towards the rather
bedraggled little azure serpent. The little azure serpent’s body
was torn open, but it was rapidly healing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She, too, looked
towards these two humans who had temporarily rescued her from
disaster. As she did…she was instantly dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That fur-clad youth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His appearance…it was
identical to that arrogant youth of the Ji clan who had challenged
her to do battle countless times, back in Eastmount Marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little
snakey-snake!” Ning stared towards that distant, somewhat stupefied
azure snake. He began to roar with laughter. “Don’t you recognize
me anymore?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little snakey-snake?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The little azure snake
was stupefied. That nickname…it was so familiar. Back then, that
arrogant youth of the Ji clan had addressed her in this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is you!”
The little azure snake instantly shouted back in shock, “You are
that arrogant kid of the Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Listen
up! My name is Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a flash, the
little azure snake moved next towards Ning. It even transformed into
human form, into an azure-robed maiden. Her face was rather ashen,
but the azure-robed maiden inspected Ning closely, as though she
wanted to carefully inspect even the pores on Ning’s face.
Completely flabbergasted, she said, “You really are that kid of the
Ji clan? You weren’t killed by Ironwood Zhan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I killed Ironwood
Zhan,” Ning said with a pursed smile. “I didn’t expect that in
human form, you’d assume the form of a woman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed maiden
stared back at him. “I was a female to begin with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been many years
since they had met. One had only been at the Houtian level, while the
other was an ordinary Xiantian monster. Back then, they had battled
many times, but now, when they saw each other, they felt so very
close, very familiar with each other…perhaps this was the effect of
running into a familiar face in an unfamiliar place. This naturally
made them feel all the closer to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two!” The
distant Dragonwhale frowned. He naturally could tell that this human
youth seemed to be familiar with the Azure Skysnake. He immediately
barked, “Stop acting so friendly with each other. This is my turf,
and you are currently within the grand formation I am controlling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed
maiden’s earlier joy instantly evaporated. She hurriedly sent
mentally to the nearby Ning, “Kid of the Ji clan, it seems as
though you are now quite powerful. However, don’t think that just
because you were able to overcome the human form of that Wanxiang
monster, that you are capable of defeating that group of monsters.
There are sixteen Wanxiang monsters present, and when they are in
their true forms, their power will increase explosively. And that
Dragonwhale…by himself, he’s more powerful than the rest of them
joined together. It not only is a Dragonwhale with tremendous talent
and incomparably great strength, it also trains as a Fiendgod Body
Refiner, and has a divine ability. Its power is tremendous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. A
Fiendgod Body Refiner, with a divine ability?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dragonwhale
monster is the leader of the Mount Demonlotus region,” the
azure-robed maiden sent. “He has tens of Wanxiang monsters under
his control. This time, to attack me, he only brought fifteen of
them. He has long ago reached the peak of the Wanxiang level as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner. With his divine ability and his innate
talent…you cannot take him on as an enemy. Hurry up and flee. Don’t
worry about me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Dragonwhale
shouted calmly, “I will give you two choices. The first choice is
to immediately leave. The two of you will be able to live. The second
choice is to die, both of you, right here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson stood there,
grinning, seeming quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was similarly
relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid of the Ji clan,
don’t be stupid. Hurry up and leave. If you are willing to do so,
in the future, get revenge for me,” the azure-robed maiden sent to
him. “For I, Qingqing, to be able to see you before I die is
already enough. It can be said that the heavens were not unkind to
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced towards
the distant Dragonwhale and the fifteen other monsters next to him.
Their auras were surging towards the heavens. Ning said in a clear
voice, “Dragonwhale, I’ll give you two choices as well. The first
choice is, I’ll leave with this little snakey-snake, and you can
live. The second choice is, I’ll kill all of you, and then I’ll
take this little snakey-snake away.”

Chapter 23 - Monsters Executed By The Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed maiden
stared, astonished, towards the nearby Ji Ning. This Ji Ning actually
dared say something like this? These words were too…too dominating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Wanxiang
monsters were startled as well. Instantly, a Wanxiang monster howled
in rage, “Human punk, kill us all? Just you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are looking to
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A little human punk
like you dares to be so arrogant?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wanxiang monsters
were all enraged, but they didn’t dare to act rashly. The nearby
Dragonwhale stretched his hand out, and instantly, the other monsters
all fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale looked
weighingly at this human youth. Ning’s calm appearance caused him
to be puzzled…what abilities did this human youth have, for him to
dare to act so confidently? But just now, the Wanxiang Manifestation
had indicated clearly…that this youth was indeed merely a Wanxiang
Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many thoughts flashed
through the Dragonwhale monster’s mind. In the end, he said in a
growling voice, “I’ll give you a final chance to live. Leave,
immediately!” Given his fame and prestige, how could he possibly be
scared off by a few words from Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
began to laugh. He looked at the nearby Mu Northson. “Junior
apprentice-brother, tell me, are they or aren’t they seeking a path
to death for themselves?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are, indeed,
seeking a path to death for themselves.” Northson laughed as well.
He knew exactly what this senior apprentice-brother of his was
capable of. His [Soulshaker Art] was comparable to a Primal Daoist’s,
and even the majority of those six elite Wanxiang Adepts in
Northriver Zhou’s group had died due to it, despite having
protective treasures which their seniors had bestowed upon them. If
it hadn’t been for those treasures, most likely all of them would
have died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Wanxiang
monsters? At most, Ning would spend a little extra time on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and depart.
Don’t charge straight into the path of death.” Ning’s 729
flying swords hovered about him, forming that jade-white sword of
light in front of him. Ning stretched out a finger, gently tapping
the jade-white sword. It actually emitted a clear, ringing sound;
this jade-white sword of light had actually condensed so much that it
was like a real flying sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t
leave, I’m going to start a massacre,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pupils of the
distant Dragonwhale monster shrank, but the light from his abyssal,
green eyes brightened significantly. His savage aura began to fill
the heavens, and he roared out an order: “Use all methods available
to you at full strength and kill these two humans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were waiting for
these words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, leave
it to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slaughter him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Wanxiang monster
after another immediately transformed into their true forms. They
were avians, they were hooved beasts, they were aquatic beasts…they
had jade eyes, they had three eyes…in short, they were all sorts of
strange creatures. After transforming into their true forms, all of
them emanated a heaven-filling monstrous aura. And then, with savage
howls, they charged towards Ning and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sight caused
tremendous shock to the azure-robed maiden by Ning’s side. She
looked towards the nearby Ning, then sent hurriedly, “Are you just
bluffing them, or are you really that capable? Nine years ago, you
weren’t even at the Xiantian level. It’s only been nine
years…these are all Wanxiang monsters. If you aren’t able to beat
them, hurry up and run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little
snakey-snake…” Ning pursed his lips into a grin. “You just
watch and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently flicked at
the jade-white sword in front of him. Hearing the clear ringing
sound, he beamed. “They are nothing more than birds made of mud and
toy mutts made from bricks. Junior apprentice-brother, let’s do
it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade-white sword in
front of him immediately transformed into a gleaming Waterflame
Millstone. Moving as fast as the wind, it howled forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
Northson’s hands swept out with two rays of black light which
transformed into two giant black snakes in the air, which flew over
with a howl as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce look flashed
through Ning’s eyes. The Soulshaker Seal in front of his divine
soul, seated within his sea of consciousness, suddenly brightened
dramatically. A large amount of divine will surged forth from the
Soulshaker Seal. Under Ning’s control, it crushed outwards towards
every direction. Savage, turbid waves of divine will roared forth,
and everything within its path was struck by the waves of divine
will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine will moved
at an incredible speed, faster than even the flying swords and
constructs. Even before the sword-light had arrived, Ning’s waves
of divine will had collided with the souls of those fifteen Wanxiang
monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!! The fifteen
Wanxiang monsters were all filled with boundless self-confidence and
killing intent, but suddenly, the invisible, formless wave of divine
will struck them, causing them to feel as though their souls had been
viciously smashed down upon by an iron warhammer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even as terror appeared
in their minds, they all became dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light of the
ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was
incomparably soft and slick. It howled drearily like the wind as it
moved forward, first chopping directly through the body of the
golden-furred ape. The golden-furred ape didn’t try to resist in
the slightest, allowing the sword-light to easily chop through it
from head to tail, slicing it in half. And then, still howling
forward, it chopped towards the white-furred fox, which was similarly
split in half in an instant…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” On the
other side, the two black water-snakes under Northson’s control
also savagely attacked their targets. The tail of one serpent
viciously lashed out, instantly disintegrating the body of one
Wanxiang monster. The tail of the other serpent tightened around the
bodies of another monster, crushing it to smithereens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How fast was the
sword-light? How fast was the flight of the constructs? The
Dragonwhale monster in the distance had been watching calmly as Ning
and Northson had unleashed their sword-light and constructs, and he
had paid them no heed. He believed that the fifteen Wanxiang monsters
under his command would definitely be able to resist, and should even
have the advantage. “I imagine, these two humans will be killed
without needing me to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as this thought
flashed past his mind, he saw, to his astonishment, that in the face
of Ning’s sword-light and Northson’s constructs, his fifteen
Wanxiang monsters didn’t fight back at all, allowing the attacks to
strike them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, these were
monsters. However, it must be understood that if they weren’t using
any defenses at all, even Primal Daoists wouldn’t dare to use their
bodies to block the sword-light of a Sword Immortal, even if the
Sword Immortal was only at the Wanxiang Adept stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” The
sword-light danced, and the constructs danced as well. In but the
blink of an eye, the sword-light had consecutively executed nine
monsters. The other monsters were all finished with a single chop;
only the giant, black-shelled turtle had required two chops. The
first chop hadn’t been able to crack its shell; the second time,
Ning’s sword-light had shot forward like ‘Chef Ding carving the
ox’ 1; he carved in through the seams and the slits, thus executing
the black-shelled turtle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other six
monsters, they were crushed into mincemeat by Northson’s
constructs. In but the blink of an eye, the fifteen monsters had all
been killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” The
white-furred fox, after being chopped into two pieces, actually
reformed, then frantically retreated in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod Body
Refiner?” Ning laughed softly. “You won’t be able to escape.”
The rolling waves of divine will once more struck the white-furred
fox, and the fleeing fox was once more stunned. The sword-light once
more flashed towards it through the air in an incomparably graceful
manner, easily chopping her apart. At the same time, a beautiful
Waterflame Lotus bloomed next to her, completely surrounding her
within. Soon, it ground the flesh and blood of the white-furred fox
into dust. Soon, the divine power within the flesh and the blood was
used up, and the fox became deader-than-dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteen Wanxiang
monsters were now all dead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing Wanxiang
monsters really is much easier than killing Wanxiang Adepts,” Ning
murmured to himself. “Not a single one of them had any protective
treasures bestowed by seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Complete silence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire wilderness
had fallen silent. Ning and Northson smiled in a relaxed fashion, but
the nearby azure-robed maiden was completely stupefied. “Fifteen
Wanxiang monsters, all of them extremely powerful and at the middle,
late, or even peak Wanxiang level. Why is it that when faced with
this kid of the Ji clan, none of them resisted at all, resulting in
them instantly being killed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Ning’s divine
will had bypassed her, she didn’t realize that Ning had used it to
attack at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only been
nine years.” The azure-robed maiden looked towards Ning, somewhat
dazed. “I’m an Azure Skysnake. I’ve gone to many places and
have encountered repeated strokes of good fortune, and have even
apprentice myself to a monster Immortal. Only thus did I reach the
Wanxiang level. How is it that this kid of the Ji clan…was able to
kill Wanxiang monsters as easily as killing a chicken? How could he
have become even more powerful than me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two had
battled at Eastmount Marsh countless times, their power had always
been roughly equal. The Azure Skysnake had felt quite confident that
her power had risen very quickly, but now, it seemed….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Dragonwhale
monster was both stunned and incomparably enraged. Immediately
afterward, however, he calmed down. He stared at the distant Ning and
Northson, then said in a low voice, “No wonder you are so
confident. You actually have a divine will technique. And you have
such a powerful divine soul; when using the divine will technique,
you were actually able to affect fifteen Wanxiang monsters with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Even
before joining the Black-White College, his soul had already reached
the ‘divine sense’ level. Now that more than three years had
passed, he had increased his comprehension of the Dao, his
sword-heart had been honed, and he had spent every day of the past
three years visualizing the [Nuwa Painting], and enjoying the
soul-improving benefits it brought…by now, Ning’s soul would be
considered powerful even amongst Primal Daoists. Affecting fifteen
Wanxiang monsters at the same time was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pressure these
fifteen Wanxiang monsters had given him was even less than the
pressure those six Wanxiang Adepts of Northriver Zhou’s group had
brought! However, this Dragonwhale monster…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt confident in
his ability to handle it, and also completely confident in his
ability to flee. However, Ning didn’t feel completely confident in
being able to actually defeat or kill it. After all, the opponent was
extraordinarily talented, and a Fiendgod Body Refiner with a divine
ability. To kill it would definitely be incomparably difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and depart.
I’ll spare your life.” Ning stared towards the Dragonwhale
monster and spoke in a cold voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through the eyes of the Dragonwhale. After having consecutively
killed fifteen monsters in such an awe-inspiring manner, Ning’s
words did indeed have a rather frightening effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think you can
scare me off by killing those monsters?” The Dragonwhale said
hoarsely, “I was born in the Darknorth Sea and have wandered many
places. I then entered this region, then arrived in the wild marshes
of the Gaol Mountains…I’ve already dominated this region for ten
thousand years, and I’ve even battled Primal Daoists on several
occasions. You, a puny Wanxiang Adept, want to scare me away? You are
dreaming!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared into the
distance. “Then let’s stop wasting words. Accept your death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Accept death?” The
Dragonwhale monster began to roar with wild laughter. His laughter
was like the thunder, echoing out to a distance of a hundred
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Suddenly, he
disappeared, his body dissolving into mist, then reforming in midair
to become an incomparably massive, bizarre beast. This bizarre beast
had the head of a dragon, but the body of a whale. The dragon’s
whiskers were more than three hundred meters long, and the length of
the body of the entire Dragonwhale was more than three thousand
meters. And then, the green light emanating from its body suddenly
increased dramatically in brightness, and its body actually began to
slowly increase to a size of ten thousand meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This massive, ten
thousand meter long Dragonwhale hovered there in the air, completely
covering the skies and casting the land below it into darkness. The
vast, endless savage aura from it filled every part of the area,
causing one’s heart to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and the
azure-robed woman all raised their heads, staring towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, that’s big.”
Northson stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid of the Ji clan,
are you really…able to handle it?” The azure-robed woman’s face
turned even whiter than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared into the
distance. “Little snakey-snake…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You just watch and
see!”

Chapter 24 - Ji Ning Explodes With His Full Power!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ji Ning
frowned. “Why are the Darknorth swords in my Zifu region
trembling?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately sent in
his divine sense to investigate his Zifu region in detail. Many magic
treasures were hovering with his Zifu region, and amongst them were
three Darknorth swords. The investigation of his divine
sense…instantly discovered that streaks of blood red baleful energy
and gray, evil energy were coming in from the outside world,
constantly flowing towards the Darknorth swords and being absorbed by
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth swords
had undergone the Fiendgod Rites of Bloodforging. They were so happy
when absorbing the evil, baleful auras that they were beginning to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
this time, I really killed too many Wanxiang monsters. The evil,
baleful, energies from them were also very strong. The evil, baleful
energies generated when I killed those two Wanxiang Adepts last time
were nowhere as strong,” Ning mused to himself. Only when one
personally killed monsters would the evil, baleful auras from them
swirl around one’s self, and then be absorbed by the Darknorth
swords. If he didn’t have the Darknorth swords to absorb them…the
evil, baleful auras would continuously swirl around him. As time went
on, they would slowly grow faint, but in the end, a few remnants
would be left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning did have
the Darknorth swords to absorb the auras, there were still residual
baleful auras and evil auras! This was why those who had committed
countless killings would still emanate an incomparable, shockingly
baleful aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive
Dragonwhale, ten thousand meters long, covered the skies with its
massive bulk. It hung there in the air, staring downwards, a cold
look in its glowing green eyes. Its voice once more rumbled out like
thunder. “Human, accept death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
sword-light flashing in his eyes. “Hmph.” Ning’s voice turned
cold as well. Bang! His divine will surged forth from his Soulshaker
Seal, exploding forth and flooding upwards in a crushing series of
waves, instantly colliding against the massive Dragonwhale’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
Dragonwhale had prepared itself, it still felt its soul tremble. Even
its massive airborne body suddenly sank downwards for a moment, but
soon afterwards, it regained its stability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
surprised. “He actually shook it off in an instant?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning willed it
again, and his divine will once more surged forth. The Dragonwhale in
midair was struck once more by Ning’s divine will, but its eyes
were only filled with savagery; clearly, it remained perfectly lucid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
divine will technique!” The Dragonwhale stared downwards, its voice
rumbling. “Human, your divine will technique is comparable to a
Primal Daoists! However, I am a Godbeast with exceptional talents,
and have lived for more than ten thousand years. The passage of
countless years has tempered my Dao-heart and strengthened my soul.
Don’t think you can do anything to me just through your divine will
technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
surprised as well. This Dragonwhale really was quite extraordinary;
it was actually able to remain awake after being struck by Ning’s
divine will attack. Still, Ning had somewhat expected this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because this
Dragonwhale had claimed to have fought against Primal Daoists.
Someone who could battle against Primal Daoists would generally be
able to defend against the divine will attacks of them. For example,
Ning’s senior apprentice-brother, Bloodshadow; Bloodshadow was a
Fiendgod Body Refiner with a divine ability, and a two-clawed
Raindragon Guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He trained in the most
painful of all techniques, the [Indestructible Bloodshadow Body]; one
could imagine how resilient Bloodshadow’s Dao-heart was, for him to
be capable of training in this technique to such a high level. And
precisely because of this, Bloodshadow didn’t have to be afraid of
the divine will attacks of Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…previously,
when Ning dealt with ‘Dong One’ of Snowdragon Mountain, Dong One
had been able to escape in front of Ning, precisely because he was
able to just barely remain conscious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal Daoists were
simply a level higher than Wanxiang Adepts in power, after all.
Although they were much stronger, if they wanted to dominate just
through using their divine will…against truly peerless, elite
Wanxiang Adepts, it wouldn’t be enough. Wanxiang monsters like this
Dragonwhale, in turn, clearly had extremely powerful Dao-hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, don’t grow
too arrogant, just because you were able to receive my divine will
technique,” Ning barked. “Now, receive my sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 700+ flying swords
in the surrounding area instantly began to radiate light. In front of
Ning’s chest, a jade-white sword of light instantly appeared. As
though chopping through countless barriers and moving with
incomparable difficulty, it appeared to ‘slowly’ flew up…but
this was a misperception, as in reality, it was ridiculously fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] - Manifold Thistlethorns!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” The
Dragonwhale in midair let out a cold snort. Its two extremely long
dragon-whiskers instantly grew even lower, moving to entangle Ning’s
attacking sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade-white sword
was so beautiful as to move one’s heart. In midair, it slashed out
in what could only be described as a flawless arc, easily avoiding
the entangling strikes of those two dragon-whiskers, chopping
directly towards the head of the Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fast
sword…what a frightening sword.” The Dragonwhale was secretly
surprised. His dragon-whiskers were an ‘intrinsic magic treasure’
that were used to constrict and defend against opponents. They
weren’t even able to touch the opponent’s sword-ligiht?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale let out
an angry roar. The nostrils of his draconic head suddenly emitted two
streams of dire-ice which could be seen with the naked eye. The
dire-ice instantly swept towards Ning’s ray of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light moved
like a ghost. In midair, it once more moved in an enormous, solitary
arc, managing to evade the dire-ice and then plunge directly towards
the Dragonwhale’s giant head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash!” It was
simply too fast. The Dragonwhale wasn’t able to dodge in time; the
sword-light plunged directly into its head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword attack was
filled with early-stage Wanxiang energy, formed by the ninth level of
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and executed in accordance
with Ning’s most powerful sword art…the power of it was
unimaginable! Crackle crackle crackle!!! It pierced through one layer
of armor after another, but the massive body of the Dragonwhale was
simply too dominatingly vast. Its entire body was akin to a magic
treasure. After chopping through to a depth of thirty meters, the
light of the jade-white sword finally vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The hell?” Ning
cursed to himself. “Its carapace is actually this thick?” It must
be understood that the body of the Dragonwhale was ten thousand
meters long, and the draconic head was many hundreds of meters long
as well. Stab in a mere thirty meters? This was nothing more than
stabbing into its skin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny human, even if
I stood here and permitted you to strike at me, you still wouldn’t
be able to harm me. That sword-light of yours…that’s just
tickling me.” The Dragonwhale instantly began to laugh wildly, and
its laughter echoed within a hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was finally
understanding exactly how difficult it was to deal against a peak
Wanxiang Godbeast with a divine ability. Its body alone was so
powerful…no wonder it was able to survive, even when facing a
Primal Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just tickling?”
The nearby Northson’s face had changed as well. “Senior
apprentice-brother’s [Soulshaker Art] was useless, and even his
sword-formation was only able to tickle it. This Wanxiang monster
really is terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid of the Ji clan.
If you aren’t able to beat him, we need to immediately flee. If too
much time passes, we won’t be able to escape,” the azure-robed
maiden sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, should we flee?” Northson sent a mental message
to Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave the two each
a glance, confidence in his eyes. He said in a clear voice,
“Dragonwhale, I was just playing around with you just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Playing around?”
The Dragonwhale’s massive, lake-sized eyes stared downwards. “If
you have anything else, show me what you have. Otherwise, you’ll
never have the chance to do so ever again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such ignorance. You
are a frog seated in a well, staring at the skies.” Two Darknorth
swords appeared in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
Dragonwhale stared downwards at the longsword-wielding human youth,
as though seeing something that was completely inconceivable.
“You…can it be that you are actually dreaming of fighting me in
close combat? Hahaha, are you sure you haven’t made a mistake?
Human kid, if you immediately flee, then due to your divine will
technique, I’m not confident in being able to catch you. But if you
move close to me and battle me, you really will be throwing your life
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a monster with a
mighty Fiendgod-like body, the Dragonwhale was naturally the most
skilled at close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid of the Ji clan,
this is a peak Wanxiang monster with a Fiendgod-like body, and with a
divine ability. And it is a Dragonwhale!” The azure-robed maiden
was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ning
leapt forward, soaring into the skies and transforming into a streak
of light, instantly moving thousands of meters and charging towards
the Dragonwhale above him. While charging towards the skies, Ning’s
eyes were filled with coldness. He wielded two of the Darknorth
swords, and while flying in midair, his body became covered with
crimson light. His body was quickly increasing in size; he actually
transformed into a ten meter tall giant. This was a ‘magnified’
Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod body!
Heavenly Transformation?” The azure-robed maiden called out in
shock, then hurriedly sent a mental message to Northson, whose face
was similarly filled with concern. “This kid from the Ji clan is
going to fight head on against the Dragonwhale…does he have a
chance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
Northson stared fixedly towards the skies. He sent back, “However,
I heard that in the past, before joining the Black-White College, my
senior apprentice-brother was able to rely on his close combat skills
to become famous. I hear that he is most skilled in close combat and
is very formidable…but I’ve never seen him truly fight in close
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is most skilled
in close combat?” The azure-robed maiden no longer asked any
further questions, because the battle occurring in the skies was
making her incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning soared into
the heavens, as he was executing the Heavenly Transformation
technique, the two dragon-whiskers of the Dragonwhale in the sky once
more swooped towards him, trying to entangle him. In addition, the
Dragonwhale once more let out an angered snort. Rumble…two streaks
of dire-ice belched forth from its nostrils, spreading out and
freezing the air itself as it swept towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light was
able to dodge, but although Ning had the Windwing Evasion technique,
he couldn’t possibly compete with sword-light in terms of speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t dodge?
Then…he would chop it apart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!” Ning
violently swung the Darknorth swords in his hands, executing the
second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], the ‘Manifold
Thistlethorns’. Where his swords flashed past, the layers of
dire-ice were all chopped apart, and even the dragon-whiskers that
sought to entangle him were split apart and sent flying. Ning’s
speed dropped as a result, but he had already reached the head of the
Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The
Dragonwhale’s massive body suddenly twisted, and its massive tail
swept towards Ning in a whipping motion, covering the earth and
blocking out the skies as it did so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning leapt directly
atop the Dragonwhale’s massive tail, utilizing his Windwing Evasion
technique to charge directly towards the Dragonwhale’s head. The
divine ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’, was something which
allowed Ning’s speed to increase dramatically to begin with. Now,
with the Windwing Evasion supporting him as well, Ning was
astonishingly agile and quick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…this
Dragonwhale’s massive, monster body was still ten thousand meters
long. It was quite accustomed to enemies climbing atop its body in a
battle, and it actually didn’t care about it, because it had its
methods for dealing with this. In addition, generally speaking, most
of its enemies weren’t even able to break through its first
carapace layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, Ning had
moved from the tail of the Dragonwhale to its draconic head. “Kill!”
Ning’s eyes exploded with an incomparably savage intent for battle.
After three years, he was finally going to once more unleash his most
powerful divine technique, one of the top ten most terrifying divine
techniques which had existed ever since Pangu had established the
universe…the [Starseizing Hand]! In this instant, Ning felt his
blood was boiling, was bellowing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been so long.
Too long! He hadn’t met an opponent who could truly make him battle
wildly in far too long. Even when he had been very weak, he had still
been able to kill Adept Xu Li in a single exchange with the
[Starseizing Hand]. He had never before used the [Starseizing Hand]
to engage in a truly heart-pumping battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“COME, THEN!”
Ning’s aura was as magnificent as a dragon’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
Dragonwhale suddenly felt as though the aura of this ‘ant-like’
human on its body had suddenly exploded and become incomparably
terrifying. It even felt a sense of tremendous danger, the likes of
which it usually only felt when facing Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” A thick
dire-ice aura suddenly emanated from the body of the Dragonwhale, and
the vast amounts of dire-ice frantically tried to freeze Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s twin swords
instantly transformed into two sword-rivers. In an invincible,
irresistible manner, it blasted past the blocking dire-ice as though
the dire-ice was nothing more than rotting wood, and then, with a
crackle, charged directly into the body of the Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of Ji
Ning’s sword light, that incomparably tough body of the
Dragonwhale, comparable to a magic treasure…finally began to crack.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_25___A_Suggestion"></A>
Chapter 25 - A Suggestion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did he become
this powerful? My Fiendgod body isn’t able stop his attack at
all?!” The Dragonwhale could feel the ant-like man easily burrowing
through his head. The Dragonwhale instantly panicked. “Force him
out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had instantly
burrowed more than three hundred meters deep into the draconic head
of the Dragonwhale. Right at this moment, a flood of watery green
light suddenly surged towards him from every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine power!”
Ning instantly understood; this was the divine power of the
Dragonwhale. Divine power was stored in every single part of a
Fiendgod’s body. At this moment, with but a thought, the
Dragonwhale had sent the tremendous amount of divine power that
resided in its head in a flood towards Ning. It was simply too
ferocious! Endless amounts of divine power surged out, causing even
Ning to shrink back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually has this
much divine power?!” Suddenly, Ning understood that his chances of
actually killing this Dragonwhale probably weren’t very high. This
was because the amount of divine power contained within this massive
body was unfathomably greater than his own. To kill such an enormous
creature…one had to have power that was far greater than it, as
otherwise, one would only be able to harm it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning,
after executing the [Starseizing Hand], was incomparably valiant. He
burst through the flood-like waters of divine power, charging
straight towards the weak spots of the Dragonwhale’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wherever Ning moved,
those two streaks of sword-light accompanied him, wildly hacking and
chopping away throughout the insides of the Dragonwhale’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The head was the most
central, core part of the body. If an ordinary Xiantian Fiendgod’s
head was severely damaged, it would immediately perish. Upon reaching
the Blood-Drop Rebirth level (the Zifu level), although they wouldn’t
die…they would lose control over their bodies, and would only feel
an innate instinct to reform and repair their bodies. After reaching
the Wanxiang level, Fiendgods could rely on their control over their
bodies to easily change their appearances and shape, but upon the
head being damaged, they would still find their control over their
bodies being dramatically weakened, albeit they wouldn’t lose
complete control. They would only be barely capable of a few simple
techniques. After reaching the Primal level, however…they could
even separate off a part of their flesh to create a clone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgods at the Zifu
level were capable of Blood-Drop Rebirth. At the Wanxiang level, they
were capable of changing their appearances and form. At the Primal
level, they were capable of creating clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For powerful Fiendgods,
pulling out a hair and forming a clone with it was simplicity itself.
1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Primal-level
Fiendgods, the head was no longer important or special at all. At the
Wanxiang level, however…the head was still important. At this
level, the divine soul primarily resided within the sea of
consciousness; once the head was damaged, the divine soul’s control
over the body would naturally be greatly lowered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” As
Ning’s sword-light pierced through the vital points of the head,
the entire Dragonwhale’s body began to tremble in mid-air, and then
it began to fall towards the ground. While falling, the entire,
massive body of the Dragonhead was twisting and twitching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson and the
azure-robed maiden watched this below, incomparably nervous. The
azure-robed maiden, seeing this, sent mentally to Northson in
disbelieving joy, “Can it be that he’s won? Your senior
apprentice-brother really is so formidable that he can even defeat
the Dragonwhale?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seems so.”
Northson was watching as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, this
Dragonwhale is a Fiendgod. He won’t be destroyed so easily.” The
azure-robed woman continued to watch, nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the
Dragonwhale’s head. Ning had slashed through multiple vital points;
instantly, the resistance ability of the entire Dragonwhale began to
drop dramatically. Ning understood that his opponent’s control over
it’s body had already become extremely weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning’s
eyes flashed. “Waterflame Lotus.” Instantly, one enormous
Waterflame Lotus after another began to bloom in the surrounding
area, beginning to grind and strike at the Dragonwhale’s body.
These Waterflame Lotuses were all many tens of meters long, and
appeared at the chest of the Dragonwhale, beginning to grind away
wildly at parts of its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grind, grind, grind. It
wasn’t able to grind through! “Eh?!” Ning stared. They weren’t
able to grind through? “Smaller, smaller, smaller.” Ning willed
the Waterflame Lotuses to instantly shrink in size, and their power
continuously increased as they did so. Six Waterflame Lotuses, each
of them thirty meters in diameter, once more began to grind against
the Dragonwhale’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a freak.”
Ning was truly stunned. “The power of my Waterflame Lotuses is now
incomparably greater than in the past, but when their power is
dispersed too widely, they aren’t able to grind down its body at
all. Its flesh and its muscles are simply too tough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a diameter of thirty
meters, Ning was able to keep the Waterflame Lotuses at the peak of
their power. Clearly, only when the Waterflame Lotuses were at
maximum power would they be able to grind and damage this creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…they were
only able to grind a little bit of flesh away. How long would it take
to grind away a ten thousand meter body? Most likely, the speed of
the grinding wouldn’t even be able to match up to the rate at which
the divine power of the Dragonwhale would naturally regenerate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BOOM!” The head of
the Dragonwhale suddenly exploded, and Ning was thrown aside as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow. He
actually discarded his head.” As Ning was sent flying back by the
explosion, he felt stunned by the Dragonwhale’s decisiveness.
Although the Dragonwhale’s control over its body was very weak, it
was still capable of a few simple techniques. A self-detonation of
its head was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The head had completely
detonated, and the massive body of the Dragonwhale was sent flying as
well. In the process, the head of the Dragonwhale once more grew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale
released a furious howl. “RAAAAAAWR!” Accompanying this
heaven-shaking roar was its massive, sky-covering tail, which swung
directly towards Ning. It was too fast! In addition, this massive,
fan-shaped tail, in terms of width, was nearly three thousand meters.
Ning was in midair, unable to borrow strength from anything else and
not as nimble as he was on the ground. For a moment, he was
completely unable to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he couldn’t
dodge…then he wouldn’t!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall…BREAK!”
Ning’s twin Darknorth swords transformed into two rivers of
sword-energy. He let out an explosive roar, chopping directly towards
the massive tail sweeping towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive tail was
like a giant fan, blocking out the entire sky. The two streaks of
sword-light, however, were like arrows that were going to pierce
through the firmament. The two collided!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
heavens had shattered and the earth had collapsed. The air itself
seemed to blow apart. Fresh, scarlet blood instantly spewed out,
seeming to dye the skies themselves red. Ning was knocked downwards
like a meteor, smashing into the wilderness below. The desolate land,
with a massive thudding sound, instantly shattered apart, with
massive, deep crevices appearing in a turtle-shell pattern. As for
Ning himself, he was knocked deep underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human.” The
massive tail of the midair Dragonwhale now had an astonishing wound
in it. The massive wound, many hundreds of meters deep, had nearly
split the tail in half. This wound was currently healing at high
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It stared downwards,
clearly sensing that the aura of this human, deep underground, was
still as powerful and as wild as ever. It didn’t seem to have
weakened at all. The Dragonwhale now understood…the enemy was also
a Fiendgod Body Refiner. A single blow would at most be able to wound
the foe, but the foe could also heal perfectly at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that you are even more powerful as a Fiendgod Body Refiner than as a
Ki Refiner. You truly hide your power well.” The Dragonwhale’s
voice rumbled forth, and then it transformed into a streak of light,
flying far away at high speed. As it left, its formation flags also
flew into the air, soaring towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning leapt out
from the underground crevice, landing on the surface of the ground
once more. “He’s gone?” Ning continued to hold the Darknorth
swords in his hands, staring towards the distant, departing
Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you actually beat the Dragonwhale monster into a
retreat?” Northson was quite excited. The nearby azure-robed
maiden, in turn, was completely stupefied. She stared at the
Dragonwhale, which disappeared into the distance, then towards that
young, seemingly fragile youth, who looked just like he had in the
past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you beat the
Dragonwhale into retreating? Is it possible that you actually have a
younger twin brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
replied back, “What’s going on in that mind of yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can you be so
powerful? I had countless lucky encounters, you know.” The
azure-robed maiden stared at Ning blankly. “That was the
Dragonwhale…I heard that it was even able to stay alive when facing
Primal Daoists. It was extremely powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed
strong,” Ning said. “In particular, its body is so massive that
the amount of divine power within it has reached an inconceivable
level. To kill it? I don’t have that ability at all. Even Primal
Daoists…I imagine that only Primal Daoists that were capable of
completely dominating it would be able to kill it. Otherwise…ordinary
Primal Daoists wouldn’t be able to do anything to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Much like how Wanxiang
Adepts could have differing levels of power, the same was true for
Primal Daoists. Primal Daoists of the Black-White College, for
example, had all comprehended a complete Dao Path before entering the
Primal level! Or, for example, Northmont Blacktiger; who was a
candidate to be the next Marquis of Stillwater; he gave Ning a sense
of incomparably great danger. These could all be considered
exceptional figures amongst Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you aren’t able
to do anything to it, why did it flee?” The azure-robed maiden
asked. “Because he’s not able to do anything to me either,”
Ning laughed. “In addition, after I slashed through the vital
points in his head, his control over his body weakened
dramatically…any Fiendgod who tasted that once would never want to
taste it a second time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine soul could
clearly sense the body, but because of the damage to the head, its
control over the body was incomparably weak. This sort of feeling was
an absolute nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, each
time we exchanged blows, it came out the worse. Most likely, it felt
nervousness in its heart and was afraid that I had something else up
my sleeve,” Ning said. “And so…it naturally decided to hurry up
and flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” The
azure-robed maiden nodded. At the same time, she couldn’t help but
feel admiration for Ning. Her eyes flashed as she stared towards
Ning; he was too powerful. When he had fough against her, he had
merely been at the Houtian level. But now, he was actually as
powerful as this; even the Dragonwhale who she thought was invincible
had been beaten off by him. The other ten-plus Wanxiang monsters had
been killed as easily as chickens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, if we kept
on fighting, I would’ve left if he didn’t,” Ning said with a
sigh. Although by relying on the [Starseizing Hand], he could unleash
shockingly great power, this divine ability…it used up far too much
divine power. Its power vastly surpassed divine abilities like
‘Heavenly Transformation’, and by multiple levels, at that! This
was why Ning could explode with such strength, but the amount of
divine power it consumed was also incomparably astonishing. Ning was
unable to fight for long periods of time with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, enough of that,” Northson smirked. “I can’t
stand to hear you keep talking with such modesty. Just now, it was a
peak Wanxiang-level Fiendgod cultivator, and a Dragonwhale Godbeast
with a divine ability at that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, kid of the Ji
clan!” The azure-robed maiden suddenly called out to him. “Eh?”
Ning turned to look. “Little snakey-snake, what is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
spirit-beasts by your side? How about I join you?” The azure-robed
maiden came up with this suggestion. “I’m an Azure Skysnake; we
grow extremely quickly, and I’m skilled in discovering precious
treasure troves…when you want to teleport, you have to use Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seals, but for me, it is as simple as breathing. In
addition, when I’m at a higher level of comprehension in the
future, those large, spacelock formations will be unable to affect
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh, actually, I
already have a spirit-beast.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 26 - Dire-Ice, Earthfire
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have a
spirit-beast? Who? Why haven’t I seen it?” The azure-robed maiden
looked about, but she began to feel a vague anger in her heart. She
was a Wanxiang monster, but because she had been wandering the world
by herself for so long, she was truly beginning to grow tired. This
was why she had decided to establish a home for herself, here at
Mount Demonlotus..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, she had
suffered the pursuit and attack of the forces of the Dragonwhale. Ji
Ning’s sudden appearance, and also the relationship which existed
between them in the past, caused her to desire to journey through the
world alongside Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unexpectedly, this kid
of the Ji clan wasn’t willing to accept her good will!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s my Uncle
White,” Ning explained. “Uncle White previously followed my
father. After my father died, he followed me. The reason why he
didn’t come was because I am undergoing the Raindragon Guard
trials, and I am not permitted to bring spirit-beasts to the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” The
azure-robed maiden nodded, but she didn’t say anything else. Ning
revealed a smile. “However, although I already have a spirit-beast,
since you desire so badly to accompany me, I suppose I can force
myself to accept you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The hell do you
mean, ‘force yourself to accept me’?!” The azure-robed maiden
stared at him, furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, let’s
leave this place first.” Ning stared at the cracked, shattered
wilderness about them. “The ripples from the earlier battle might
have attracted the attention of some other monsters.” Mu Northson
and Qingqing both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dragon-headed warship
appeared out of nowhere. The three of them all stepped aboard the
warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At their level of
power, they were actually able to fly through the air by themselves.
However, that speed of flight was vastly inferior to riding on a
magic treasure…and in turn, riding on a magic treasure wasn’t as
comfortable as riding on a construct-warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The
dragon-headed warship soared forward through the clouds, while Ning
used a spirit-beast talisman. Maiden Qingqing, in turn, was willing
to become his spirit-beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the warship,
Ning stared at this azure-robed maiden. “I’ll call you Little
Qing.” “Fine.” The azure-robed woman nodded. “From today
onwards, my name shall be Ji Qingqing. What do you say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. The
nearby Northson jested, “When I lived in the tribes in my youth,
when women without clan surnames married a man, they would generally
take the names of the men they married.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, this junior
apprentice-brother of yours is actually so very naughty! I’m even
older than your grandmother!” Qingqing stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
“Fine, fine. You shall be Ji Qingqing. From today onwards, you
shall follow me…and if the day comes when you no longer wish to
follow me, just let me know, and I will restore you to freedom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the influence
of his father, Ji Yichuan, Ning treated his spirit-beasts as he might
his other brothers or sisters. He couldn’t force his spirit-beasts
to their deaths, or treat them as his slaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you saved my
life, in the future, I’ll definitely follow you.” Qingqing pursed
her lips. “In addition, since you have grown in power even more
quickly than I have…I want to see what will happen to you in the
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing. What
exactly happened to you in the past, after you left Eastmount Marsh?
Why did you end up here?” Ning asked. The nearby Northson perked
his ears up to listen as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing said, “That
year, when I comprehended the Void Blink technique, I escaped
Ironwood Zhan. I soon left Swallow Mountain and began to roam the
world. By relying on this innate ability, ‘Void Blink’, I
discovered quite a few marvelous fruits and holy elixirs, and quickly
grew to the Zifu level. Afterwards, I headed towards the famous
Whitedragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitedragon
Mountain?” Ning was stunned. “Are you referring to the monster
Immortal, Whitedragon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst humans of this
region, aside from the two most powerful forces of the Raindragon
Guard and the Northmont clan of Stillwater, the next most powerful
forces were the Black-White College, the Skysplitter Sword Sect, the
Hundred Flowers Fairyland, the Eastriver clan, the Dragonhunter clan,
the Bluewood clan, the Heavenly Saint Church, and the Blood God
Church, these eight supreme powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That, however, was just
amongst humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters had their
own great powers, such as monster Immortals. Immortal Whitedragon was
one of the extremely famous monster Immortals. This Immortal
Whitedragon’s true form was that of a female dragon, but she
possessed heaven-defying power. She was willing to teach anyone who
wished to learn; so long as one went to her, she would almost never
refuse them. However, she was still capable of training some truly
formidable monster cultivators, and had even produced Earth Immortals
and Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At Whitedragon
Mountain, I was highly valued, and was bestowed with quite a few
techniques,” Qingqing said. “After spending a few years training
at Whitedragon Mountain, I reached the peak Zifu level, and the
school instructed me to go out adventuring. They said that Azure
Skysnakes would only be able to grow fast when constantly journeying
and adventuring. The school instructed me to come to the wild marshes
of the Gaol Mountains, and I’ve spent three years here and broken
through from the peak Zifu level to the middle Wanxiang level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately asked,
“What level is your Manifestation at?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing said
confidently, “I was highly valued by the school. Naturally, my
Manifestation is that of the bright moon shining in the sky.” Ning
and Northson exchanged a glance, both rather speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years…Ning and
Northson knew exactly how much elemental ki was needed to advance
from the peak Zifu level to the middle Wanxiang level. Ning had spent
over a thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence to reach the
early Wanxiang level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many fortunate
events happened to you here at the wild marshes of Gaol Mountains?”
Ning asked.” “Seven, I suppose.” Qingqing spoke casually, but
then her eyes lit up. “Oh, right. I’ve used up everything that
can be eaten or drunk. However, there are two places that will be
very useful to you two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which two places?”
Ning and Northson instantly grew eager. A fortunate event? Aside from
him barely surviving the test of the underwater estate, Ning really
hadn’t had any fortunate events happen to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I discovered a vein
of dire-ice, and a vein of earthfire,” Qingqing said. “A vein of
dire-ice? And earthfire?” Northson and Ning’s eyes began to blaze
with excitement. In unison, they spoke out, “Where is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was dire-ice called
dire-ice? Why was earthfire called earthfire? After Pangu established
the universe, the natural world had given birth to many times of
natural, elemental energy, such as water, fire, lightning, light,
etc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning’s
Fiendgod body was formed from a wisp of the Lunar Truewater and Solar
Truefire that had been sent down by the two most exalted of heavenly
bodies, the Lunar Star and the Solar Star. That wisp of Lunar
Truewater and Solar Truefire…if one was capable of controlling them
in battle, then even an Earth Immortal who was brushed by them would
most likely perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because these
types of power came from the energy of the most exalted of stellar
bodies. This was why, when one broke through to become a Xiantian
lifeform, even Immortals were unable to disrupt it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fire, from low to high,
could be ranked as human fire, earthfire, skyfire, and truefire.
Human fire was the mortal fire which naturally occurred in the world,
the most ordinary of fires. As for earthfire…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
unique sort of fire which was created by the earth itself.
Theoretically speaking, Zifu Disciples should be capable of absorbing
a wisp of earthfire into their Zifu and nourishing it, but this was
extremely dangerous. Generally speaking, only one at the Wanxiang
level would go absorb earthfire and nourish it in their Zifu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthfire was divided
into nine grades. One could start with earthfire of the ninth grade,
then nourish it until it reached the first grade! The ninth, eighth,
and seventh grades were the low-grades; the sixth, fifth, and fourth
grades were middle-grades; the third, second, and first grades were
high-grades!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthfire of the first
grade…this represented earthfire taken to its limits. Actually, as
long as one reached the third grade…then one would be able to go
absorb a wisp of skyfire and allow the earthfire in one’s body
advance to the ‘skyfire’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
water as was true for fire. Water was also divided into human water,
earthwater, skywater, and truewater. Human water, as went without
saying, was the most ordinary, commonly seen type of water.
Earthwater was what the so-called ‘dire-ice’ was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivating earthfire
and earthwater was the same process. It required one to first find a
place which naturally had a vein of earthfire or earthwater! After
absorbing enough of the earthfire or earthwater into one’s body, if
the ‘planting’ processs was a success, there would be seeds of
fire or water which could then be nourished into earthfire or
earthwater. If one wasn’ able to find those veins of earthfire or
dire-ice…then there was nothing that could be done. This was a sort
of natural, precious treasure; one could hope to encounter it, but
not expect to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s right here in
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. The vein of dire-ice is a bit
closer, while the vein of earthfire is a bit farther away,”
Qingqing said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qingqing. You are
absolutely amazing.” Northson was incomparably excited, and he also
felt awe. “We weren’t able to find even one of them, but you
easily found two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh. Those
places that you normally won’t visit? I’ll often use my Void
Blink to enter and carefully investigate them. After having
investigated many places, I naturally discovered these two,”
Qingqing said smugly. “Given how rarely humans go there, after a
great deal of time passes, some precious treasures will naturally be
born.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly asked,
“What sort of dire-ice is that dire-ice? What sort of earthfire is
that earthfire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dire-ice and earthfire
were both just terms. There were a hundred types of earthfire, such
as moonflame earthfire, azurethunder earthfire, and what not. Even
skyfire was divided into many different types, and the awe-inspiring
truefire which caused even Immortals to tremble in fear was divided
in several types as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While I was at
Whitedragon Mountain, I procured a book, ‘Records of the World’s
Treasures’. They had records of various spirit-fruits,
spirit-grasses, and other things. There was no record regarding these
types of earthfire and dire-ice. When you go, you’ll know.”
Qingqing added hurriedly, “As for the dire-ice…I imagine that it
can be used anywhere from three to five more times. As for the
earthfire, that’s harder to say; perhaps it can only be used one or
two more times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Absorbing earthfire
into the body was a form of harvesting; a single vein of earthfire or
dire-ice couldn’t be harvested indefinitely. After being harvested
enough times, it would be used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m more aligned
towards water and wood. I choose the dire-ice,” Northson said. “I
train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],” Ning
laughed. “My body was born from Lunar Truewater and Solar Truefire.
Dire-ice, earthfire…I need to harvest each once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Let’s hurry
out.” Qingqing stood by the side of the boat, staring downwards,
then pointed towards the north. “Move towards there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Northson
replied. The dragon-headed warship immediately began to move towards
the direction where Qingqing was pointing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite excited.
His divine tattoos were what allowed him to control fire and water.
If he were to then nourish earthfire and dire-ice in his body, when
he combined them together, at very least, the power of his Waterflame
Lotus would increase dramatically. In addition, he had many other
ways he could use them. When earthfire and dire-ice were strengthened
to a sufficient level, they were definitely not inferior to any
divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning’s group
was headed towards the vein of dire-ice. Within a distant, short,
desolate mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” A
golden-robed Dong One slowly opened his eyes. “Finally, I’m
safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I joined forces with
those other five in Northriver Zhou’s group, but in the end, we
lost everything. I was fortunate in that six years ago, I acquired a
protective magic treasure thanks to that fortunate event, and so was
lucky enough to survive and escape. I wonder if the others are alive
or dead.” Dong One thought back quietly. When he recollected that
fight, he couldn’t help but feel a surge of fear, shock, and anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had heard long ago
of Ji Ning, and knew that Ning was a monstrous talent, but he didn’t
expect that even six truly elite Wanxiang Adepts would fail so
catastrophically. “That divine will technique…I wonder if it was
Ji Ning or Mu Northson who used it.” Till this very moment, Dong
One still had no idea which of the two had used the divine will
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This mountain is an
extremely mysterious place; it can be said to be the most mysterious
mountain I have located. I’ve spent so much time healing here, but
no one has discovered me.” Dong One secretly rejoiced at this. “And
it seems as though there is an underground river below here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One’s body
flickered, and he moved through the winding caverns, going deeper and
deeper within. He continued to investigate this underground river.
Soon, he felt the temperature rise to an increasingly high level, and
he slowly saw, off in the distance, a wisp of golden fire within the
cracked earth. The fire blazed with scorching heat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A vein of
earthfire!” Dong One called out in shock.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 27 - Harvesting Dire-Ice
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One had been
training for hundreds of years now, and had adventured in many
places. He had his own share of fortuitous encounters, and even had
the chance to cultivate dire-ice in his body. Previously, when he had
battled Ji Ning, he had put that dire-ice on display.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Done
One looked carefully towards that wisp of golden fire that was
swirling in the crack in the ground up ahead. This crack was roughly
six meters wide, and if one looked down into it…one would able to
barely make out the frothing lava below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This earthfire…has
some gold mixed into it? And it is both pure and dazzling…” Dong
One nodded slightly as he noted all these things. “Given that it
was born atop a river of lava, this earthfire should be the
‘goldflame earthfire’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than a
hundred types of earthfire. Some were actually insidiously,
bone-piercingly cold, while others exploded with uncontrollable
wildness. As for goldflame earthfire…it was famous for being
‘scorching’, and was an extremely fine type of earthfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity. I train
in freezing-attribute arts.” Dong One shook his head. “In
addition, my body is already nourishing dire-ice, and is completely
unsuited for nourishing earthfire as well. Once the dire-ice and
earthfire clash…most likely, I’ll transform into dust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely rare
for one to be able to simultaneously nourish both earthfire and
dire-ice. Doing so was extremely difficult, and one had to meet
extremely exacting standards in terms of talent and technique. Ning,
however, clearly fulfilled these requirements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t use it,
but others can.” Dong One had a sudden thought, a natural thought;
he could trade this goldflame earthfire to another Wanxiang Adept.
This sort of naturally occurring earthfire vein was something one
could only dream of; naturally, he had to sell it for a high price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll leave for
now.” With a flash, Dong One quietly slipped away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship was rapidly advancing towards the north through the clouds.
Mu Northson was constantly scanning the ground through the sparse
clouds. “Qingqing, are we there yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there to the
side, a small azure snake wrapped around his wrist. The little azure
snake suddenly raised its head, staring downwards, then spoke out in
the human tongue. “Not yet. I’ll tell you when we get there.
We’ll definitely arrive today, so stop worrying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s dire-ice!
How can I not be impatient?” Northson mumbled, “If we’re too
slow, someone else might end up seizing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that really
happens, you’ll just have to consider yourself unlucky.” After
saying a few things, the little azure snake once more wrapped itself
around Ning’s arm, leisurely closing its eyes and falling asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps because she
knew Ning from in the past…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps because they
were from the same homeland…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps because Ning
saved her life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But for some reason,
she very much liked to snuggle up to Ning. She felt quite comfortable
when doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, she’s not even looking outside. Is it possible
that we might’ve flown past without her even knowing about it?”
Northson said, worried. “Well, we’ll just fly back if that’s
the case,” Ning said with a smirk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I wonder what
sort of dire-ice it is,” Northson mumbled. “I’ve never had a
stroke of luck like this before.” And in truth, Ning was very
curious as well. What sort of dire-ice was this? Was it suitable for
him? His divine body was formed from Lunar Truewater and Solar
Truefire; thus, this dire-ice would hopefully, ideally be able to
connect with Lunar Truewater. Some types of dire-ice actually weren’t
able to really merge with Lunar Truewater, such as the ‘sinblood
dire-ice’. But of course, aside from those extremely rare cases,
the vast majority would be suitable for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The little
azure snake suddenly transformed into a mist, then reformed into
human shape. “Almost there.” Qingqing stood at the ship’s
rails, staring downward. “Hey, Woody, hurry up and change
directions. Curve towards the east a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist title is
Twinwood, not Woody.” Northson gave her a glare. “Not even my
senior apprentice-brother addresses me as ‘Woody’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing stared back at
him. “So what if I call you Woody? Ji Ning is my master, but you
aren’t…you’ve gotten such a great benefit from me in the form
of dire-ice, and you are going to get upset at me just because I call
you ‘Woody’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said,
resigned, “Fine, call away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to laugh. This
junior apprentice-brother of his really was easy to pick on; even
Qingqing was able to effortless pick on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh, we’re there.”
Qingqing pointed downwards. “It’s that giant lake, down there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship quickly shrank in size, and as it did so, the surface of the
warship quickly changed to become one with the color of the sky as
well, so as to avoid attracting attention. Soon, the warship arrived
in the air above this vast lake. And then, after storing the warship
away, Ning, Northson, and Qingqing moved to stand atop the lake’s
surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is it?”
Northson looked around. “This lake is thousands of kilometers
wide.” “At the bottom,” Qingqing quietly sent mentally to them.
“I have an innate affinity for water, and I entered this lake and
accidentally discovered that a secret, hidden area at the bottom.
Don’t worry…there are quite a few dangerous zones in the bottom
of this lake, so there are few monsters present, and no Wanxiang
monsters. Follow me and don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, into the
water.” Qingqing led the way, immediately entering the water. The
elemental ki surrounding their body kept the water away, allowing
them to effortlessly dive deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is deep,”
Northson sent mentally. Ning nodded as well. “It’s many
kilometers deep.” They were now able to see the bottom of the lake.
At this depth, despite their visual acuity, even they could just
barely make out the sights around here. Although they occasionally
encountered some lesser monsters, the powerful aura which Qingqing
intentionally spread out instantly terrified them into staying far
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing pointed
towards a dark abyss below. “Follow that underwater gorge and keep
going down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the
underwater gorge, the temperature of the water began to fall more and
more, and pieces of ice began to appear around them. And then, at the
very bottom of this lake gorge, an extremely thick layer of sturdy
ice appeared. Ning, Northson, and Qingqing came to a halt, standing
atop this layer of sturdy ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, I relied
on the ‘Void Blink’ technique to pass through this wall of ice to
go play around,” Qingqing sent mentally. “Roughly three thousand
meters beneath this layer of ice, there’s a hidden dire-ice vein.
Without me guiding you, you wouldn’t have been able to find this
place at all, just barging around randomly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three thousand
meters?” With but a thought, Ning sent his divine sense sweeping
downwards. Deep within this incomparably enormous piece of ice, there
was indeed a vein of dire-ice; just a single one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be cautious, Ning
and Northson both used agility techniques to charge forward by three
hundred meters each time. As they charged forcefully in, they
effortlessly smashed a tunnel through the ice. Although this ice was
as tough as a rock, to a Wanxiang Adept…it was naturally easily
parted. The coldness of the ice, in turn, was nothing to them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…Ning’s
group arrived at the location of the dire-ice vein. “This is…?”
Ning and Northson both stared at the vein of dire-ice. This vein of
dire-ice was completely formed from various pieces of dire-ice. It
was tens of meters long, and the pieces of dire-ice even had
human-shaped elemental spirits playing around in them, causing the
dire-ice to be filled with something akin to sentience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowspirit
dire-ice?” Ning revealed a look of delight. “It really is
snowspirit dire-ice!” Northson was overjoyed as well. As for the
nearby Qingqing, she immediately asked, “Well, how is this
dire-ice? I swallowed a piece of it as well and am cultivating it
inside my body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is known as
snowspirit dire-ice,” Ning said. After having spent three years at
the Black-White College, he naturally knew far more now than he had
in the past. “Even amongst dire-ice, this is a top-grade type; it
is innately filled with sentience. You should know that dire-ice can
be divided into nine grades, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I know, I
know.” Qingqing nodded. “I know this much. I hear that if one
absorbs in a first grade piece of dire-ice, one will possess
incomparably astonishing power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. But some
types of dire-ice are almost impossible to nourish to the first
grade,” Ning said. “Dire-ice is divided into nine grades; the
ninth, eight, and seventh are the ‘low-grades’, the sixth, fifth,
and fourth are the ‘middle-grades’, while the third, second, and
first are the ‘high-grades’. Generally speaking, it’s quite
impressive for dire-ice to be nurtured to the third grade; dire-ice
of the second grade is extremely rare, and the first grade is even
less common.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowspirit dire-ice
is extremely fine dire-ice, with tremendous potential. It can be
nourished to the first grade,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looks like my luck
isn’t bad,” Qingqing called out in delight. The nearby Northson
said, “And it looks as though quite a few people can use this vein
of dire-ice. Let’s immediately begin the harvesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qingqing, I’ll
leave the protecting to you.” Ning waved his hand, producing six
formation flags. “This is a bewildering formation that is extremely
strong. Unless one is skilled in formations, there is no chance of
being able to break through. While my junior apprentice-brother and I
are implanting the dire-ice into our bodies, help us stand watch.
This process is extremely dangerous, and we cannot stop it midway.
You must be very vigilant..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Qingqing
nodded. “Don’t worry, Master.” Of course she understood.
Dire-ice was, intrinsically, an extremely damaging, harmful thing;
otherwise, Immortal cultivators wouldn’t value it so much. This
sort of natural dire-ice was even more savage. During the implanting
process, one had to absorb the dire-ice into the Zifu of one’s own
body; if one was interrupted midway, the dire-ice might rupture
within the Zifu, and could even damage it. It was even possible that
this might result in death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning possessed the body
of a Fiendgod, so he wouldn’t actually die, but he still was
worried about his Zifu being damaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
freezing gorge at the bottom of the lake. Ning’s group had quickly
dug out a room of freezing ice, which became merged with this vein of
dire-ice. Outside, the bewildering formation had been set, with
Qingqing managing it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and
Northson, they sat down in the lotus position atop the ice, facing
the vein of dire-ice. “Junior apprentice-brother, you must be
careful,” Ning warned solemnly. Harvesting dire-ice…at most, Ning
might damage his Zifu and would need to spend several years healing.
His junior apprentice-brother, however…if things went badly, he
might die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already come
to a decision that if something truly amiss happened during this
process…even if he had to injure himself and halt his implanting
process to protect his junior apprentice-brother, he would do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Northson laughed. “The Dao of Constructs is a Dao of using
countless strange materials to begin with. Harvesting dire-ice…as
long as I’m careful about it, it’ll be simplicity itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Then, he
turned his head to look towards his piece of dire-ice, filled with
sentience. He immediately opened his mouth lightly, and began to
absorb! A pincer of elemental ki surged out, and a wisp of the
dire-ice in front of him began to be absorbed into Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So cold.” As soon
as the dire-ice entered his body, he instantly felt his entire body
grow cold. As a Fiendgod Body Refiner, Ning naturally didn’t mind.
However, the nearby Northson was suffering quite a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s mind
began to float the memories of how to use the [Flowing Watersource]
technique to harvest dire-ice, earthfire, direwind, direlight, and
other materials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the skies of the
Zifu region, there were thousands of stars, a luminous moon, and a
blazing sun. They simultaneously shone down rays of light. This was
all pure Wanxiang elemental ki, and they quickly formed a small,
rather nondescript island atop the boundless sea of elemental energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning absorbed that
wisp of dire-ice into his body, it departed from the outside world
and emerged here, within the Zifu region. And, as it did…Ning felt
his entire Zifu turn cold, almost stabbingly so. Not hesitating at
all, Ning instantly guided that piece of dire-ice to fly towards that
small island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like a tree being
driven into the ground, the piece of dire-ice was driven straight
through this small island.

Chapter 28 - Primal Monster
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning and Mu
Northson were absorbing wisps of dire-ice from within the glacial
ice, trying to implant it into their Zifu region…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The winds were stirring
and the clouds were gathering in the skies above ‘Dragonwhale
Peak’, of the Mount Demonlotus region. A vast amount of elemental
ki was gathering here, and in the skies, the vague manifestation of
an enormous turtle with a serpent coiled around it could be seen 1.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Turtle-Snake.
The Turtle-Snake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many monsters on
Dragonwhale Peak all raised their heads, staring in astonishment at
what had appeared in the skies. The gathering of the elemental ki,
the manifestation of the Turtle-Snake…these monstrous Immortal
cultivators naturally all knew what this represented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Wanxiang monster,
here on Dragonwhale Peak, has broken through to the Primal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be the
Primal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
astonished and excited. When Ki Refiners reached the Primal level,
regardless of whether they were Fiendgods, humans, or monsters, the
‘Primal Turtle-Snake’ would appear. The appearance of the Primal
Turtle-Snake would naturally generate a constant flow of ‘primal
fire’. The Primal Turtle-Snake embodied the most supreme of the
mysteries of the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who broke through to
the Primal level? Our Dragonwhale Peak has quite a few Wanxiang
monsters, and several of them are at the peak-stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that last
time, when his Majesty led a group of Wanxiang monsters out, he
returned by himself. I heard that all the other Wanxiang monsters
that went with him died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Wanxiang
monsters of Dragonwhale Peak, including his Majesty, number just two
or three in total. This time, it should be his Majesty who is making
the breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the monsters chatted
amongst themselves, the most powerful leader of the Mount Demonlotus
region, the Dragonwhale monster, walked out of his closed meditation
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…hahahaha….”
The massive, enormous Dragonwhale laughed with jubilation. His
laughter crashed out in waves like the thunder, shaking the entire
Dragonwhale Peak. Upon hearing this laughter, how could these
monsters not understand? Their king had made a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
your Majesty! Felicitations, your Majesty!” The monsters in front
of the Dragonwhale all fell to their knees and called out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
your Majesty! Felicitations, your Majesty!” The distant monsters
began to call this out as well, and then even more distant
monsters…in short, all of the monsters of the entire Dragonwhale
Peak began to cry out, “Congratulations, your Majesty!
Felicitations, your Majesty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their voices rumbled
through the skies and the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal? Upon reaching
the Primal stage, one would be considered a mover and shaker of the
entire Stillwater Commandery region. In addition, given the
Dragonwhale’s innate gifts, even though he had just made a
breakthrough, his combat power would still be incomparably
astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Majesty, you
have painstakingly trained for so long, but today, you have broken
through to become a Primal. You have gained eternal life, and in the
future, not even Immortals can compare to you.” A sharp-mouthed
simian monster was calling out flattery next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon becoming a Primal,
one’s lifespan did indeed become infinite. However, the
increasingly powerful ‘Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations’ would
cause Primal Daoists to eventually die at some point. Thus, only
becoming a Celestial Immortal would one truly gain eternal life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the flattery was
quite pleasing to hear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Majesty’s
innate talents are incredible, and he is a Dragonwhale with a
Fiendgod’s body…even Immortals will most likely be unable to do
anything to his Majesty,” another nearby monster, a devilishly
alluring one, flattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Majesty…”
One person after another began to flatter him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale glanced
at the surrounding lesser monsters. He sighed in his heart. In the
past, his Dragonwhale Peak had been the leading mountain peak of the
Mount Demonlotus region, and he always had ten-plus Wanxiang monsters
present. However, after that massacre by that human brat, Ji Ning,
only two Wanxiang monsters were left, and they lived in two separate
regions of Dragonwhale Peak. These little Zifu monsters in front of
him were only able to engage in flattery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortals?” The
Dragonwhale secretly shook his head. He knew exactly how powerful he
was. “I’ve only made a breakthrough as a Ki Refiner; I didn’t
make a breakthrough as a Fiendgod. After becoming a Primal…although
my power has indeed increased significantly, I’m still far from
being able to compete with Immortals. Still, in the future, if I
encounter that human punk, Ji Ning, I’ll definitely execute him.”
The Dragonwhale monster’s dark green eyes flashed with a savage
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations on
your breakthrough, Big Brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, two
streaks of light flew over. It was the other two Wanxiang monsters
who lived on Dragonwhale Peak. The Dragonwhale looked towards them,
then said in a clear voice, “It is good that you have come, my
brothers. I just made my breakthrough. When I think about how our
other brothers and sisters were massacred by that human brat…my
heart aches, and I feel endless regret. I was just about to give an
order for some of the other monster of the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains who are on good terms with us to help me search for him. We
must find those two human brats.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well spoken, Big
Brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We should
indeed take revenge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two monsters both
landed. Their bodies were massive and pitch-black, with curved horns
on their heads. They were a pair of bison-type monsters, and they
were the two who the Dragonwhale trusted in the most. Even when he
went out to do battle, he would have these two stay behind to protect
his lair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale nodded.
“I’ll send someone to deliver the letters now to the various
monster kings and have them help investigate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you’ve
made this breakthrough, the various monster kings will all have to
give you face, your Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust that we’ll
quickly be able to find them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two bison-type
monsters spoke in unison. As for the Dragonwhale, he took out a sheet
of leather parchment. Atop it, he wrote a description of Ning,
Northson, and Qingqing, as well as provided drawings of them that
were almost lifelike in their accuracy. In addition, he also
described the dragon-headed warship and a few other unique aspects.
He also filled this parchment with his powerful Primal aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the
water-imprinting technique. As a water-type monster, the Dragonwhale
naturally found it quite easy to utilize this technique. It used it
dozens of times, making tens of copies of the leather parchment. And
then, he instructed his many Zifu monsters to go deliver the letters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the Zifu monsters
all transformed into streaks of light, moving towards the various
bases of power amongst the monsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I think of that
human brat, I can’t help but want to eat his flesh and drink his
blood.” The Dragonwhale ground his teeth. “I haven’t even
avenged the death of my lifelong brother. And now, so many brothers
and sisters who have accompanied me for so many years have died as
well. The more I think about it…detestable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, don’t
be angry for now. I trust that in a few days, you will hear some
news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once we find those
human brats, we’ll go kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of the bison-type
monsters tried to placate him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” The
Dragonwhale nodded. “I’ll endure it for a few more days, and then
I’ll go kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peacock king was
seated on its throne. It glanced at the leather scroll, and as it did
so, its face instantly changed. It looked down from the throne. “Your
king…he broke through to the Primal level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our king made the
breakthrough just today,” the Zifu-level simian said with a touch
of delight. The peacock king nodded. “Understood. I will instruct
the monsters under my command to help search for these two humans and
that Azure Skysnake. Go and make the report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One group of powerful
monsters after another received letters from the Dragonwhale. From
the letter, they could sense that the Dragonwhale had broken through
to the Primal level. Those powerful monsters who had previously been
equals with the Dragonwhale now no longer dared to treat him with any
discourtesy at all. All of them gave the order to begin the search
for those two humans and the Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meanwhile, Ning and
Northson had no idea as to what had just happened in the outside
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the room of ice.
Ning and Northson were seated in the lotus position in front of the
dire-ice. The vein of dire-ice, previously many tens of meters in
size, was now less than thirty meters. Clearly, it was now a full
size smaller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One wisp after another
of dire-ice continuously flew towards the mouths of Ning and
Northson. Clearly, however, Ning’s absorption rate was much faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s about it.”
Ning’s complete attention was on his Zifu region. He didn’t dare
to be the slightest bit rash. The dire-ice within the little island
atop the sea of elemental ki in the Zifu region was beginning to
solidify and taken shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this point in time,
the dire-ice within the Zifu region was like a poisonous pustule that
could explode at any moment, causing the entire Zifu to be damaged!
This was an extremely dangerous moment! This was because the dire-ice
had yet to completely solidify and take shape. The more Ning
absorbed, the greater the danger would be. Only after the implanting
process was complete would things be safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve absorbed
enough of the dire-ice. I should be able to begin condensing it into
a ‘seed’, now.” Ning spent a few moments in preparation, and
then, with a thought, caused the thousands of stars, the Jade Rabbit,
and the Golden Crow within the skies of his Zifu region to begin to
shoot down rays of light towards that dire-ice island. These rays of
light contained incomparably pure elemental ki, and as they appeared
in the air above the dire-ice island, they began to gather together
there. They formed an incomparably transparent seal over the
dire-ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an earthen
rampart or barrier that had been erected over it, completely sealing
it in. The entire dire-ice island appeared almost crystalline in its
transparency. Above it, multiple runic symbols began to appear, and
the dire-ice began to appear and condense atop each of the runes. It
was as though the runes were the countless branches of a large tree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short period of time
later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle!” A sound
akin to the wild grass growing out from the earth. An extremely thin
layer of dire-ice emerged from the surface of the mountain, trembling
and shaking, but continuing to grow. And so, a vein of dire-ice
appeared in Ning’s Zifu, just like that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success!” Ning
instantly opened his eyes, overjoyed. He instantly saw the distant
Qingqing, who was standing guard carefully while staring at the
nearby Northson, who was still seated, absorbing the dire-ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you
succeeded?” Qingqing asked excitedly. Ning nodded. “Right. Has
anything happened to my junior apprentice-brother?” Qingqing shook
her head. “Nothing. Only, he clearly absorbs dire-ice much more
slowly than you do. You succeed in the implanation in just a day.
Given his speed, he’ll probably need three days to fully complete
the process.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. His Zifu
was even more stable than his junior apprentice-brother’s, and his
divine will was powerful as well. He was also able to control
dire-ice more easily as well. These were the reasons why Ning had
expected his implantation process to be quick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master. I have a
present to serve as your congratulatory gift for success in
implanating the dire-ice,” Qingqing laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulatory gift?
There’s no need for such things between the two us,” Ning said
with an involuntary laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll definitely
like it, Master.” Qingqing let out a mysterious smile. Then, with
the wave of her hand, she produced an enormous wooden chest that was
completely gray and emanated a fragrant scent. Ning said, puzzled,
“Something within the chest?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Qingqing
smugly opened the lid to this wooden chest. Within it, there was a
chunk of ice that was two feet long and one foot wide, and which
glowed with a hint of green light. When this piece of ice was fully
revealed, the surrounding temperature began to fall. It must be
understood that this was a room of ice to begin with; and yet, this
piece of ice was capable of causing the temperature to drop even
more?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is ancient
glacial ice,” Qingqing said smugly. “I discovered this, too, in
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. That place even has a
freezing pool of liquid. I was enjoying myself immensely, lying down
in that freezing pool and absorbing the frigid aura from it to
nourish my dire-ice, when some Immortal cultivators suddenly came.
Thus, I dug out this piece of ancient glacial ice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did indeed feel
exceptionally delighted and surprised. Qingqing truly was a little
treasure trove. That piece of dire-ice in his body was nothing but a
mere ‘seedling’, dire-ice of the ninth grade. It needed constant
nourishing. Although elemental ki could be used to nourish it, the
speed would be too slow. It would be much faster to use certain types
of precious, rare treasures, and ancient glacial ice was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you need it
for yourself?” Ning asked. “Use it for yourself. I’m in no
rush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A slightly awkward look
appeared on Qingqing’s face, “Eh heh heh, I dug out quite a bit.
I just gave you a small chunk.” “How big is your piece of ancient
glacial ice?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten meters tall.”
Qingqing lowered her head, then stretched out her dainty little hand.
An enormous chunk of ice suddenly appeared out of nowhere; it looked
like a miniature iceberg. And then, it vanished away as Qingqing
stored it away again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. It really
was ten meters tall. He then turned to look at his congratulatory
gift, the six foot tall chunk of ancient glacial ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head and
laughed. He immediately accepted it, then immediately began to
utilize the power of this ancient glacial ice to nourish the dire-ice
within his body.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning sat there, his
right hand extended. A hazy elemental ki enveloped the chunk of
ancient glacial ice within the heavy wooden chest. The cold energy of
the ancient glacial ice was absorbed by Ning steadily, all the way
into his Zifu region. Within his Zifu region, the dire-ice, upon
coming into contact with the cold energy, instantly began to
excitedly, wildly absorb it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Qingqing,
who had hesitated for quite some time, suddenly spoke out. “Eh?”
Ning turned his head to look at her. “Master, after you use up your
piece of ancient glacial ice, I can give you more.” Qingqing looked
carefully towards Ji Ning. “I’ll give you another six foot
chunk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly started
to laugh. He could tell that this Little Qing was a bit of a miser.
As he looked towards Little Qing…another woman’s figure suddenly
appeared within his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister Autumn
Leaf,” Ning murmured to himself. “It’s been more than three
years since I left Swallow Mountain. Three years since I’ve seen
her. I wonder how elder sister Autumn Leaf is doing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That woman who had
accompanied him since he was a child, who was like an older sister to
him; Ning felt deep emotions for her. “After I become a Raindragon
Guard, I need to begin investigating those three culprits who, many
years ago, harmed father, mother, and uncle so catastrophically,”
Ning mused to himself. “And…I also need to go back to Swallow
Mountain to go visit elder sister Autumn Leaf, Bluestone, and
Serpentwing Lake…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly had a
strong desire to return to Serpentwing Lake. It had been so long
since he had lain within that small boat atop Serpentwing Lake and
just floated on the surface of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing Lake!”
As Ning thought of this, a faint, fierce light began to flash in his
eyes. “Sooner or later, there will come the day when I will be able
to ensure that those I love will always live joyful lives. Tragedies
will never befall those by my side. Never!” Ning’s heart was
filled with an incomparably powerful desire, and his Dao-heart was
extremely pure. “As for Snowdragon Mountain? They are nothing more
than my first stepping stone on my Immortal path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Ning’s
target had always been to become a major power who could dominate the
Three Realms; a figure who could completely control his own destiny.
Snowdragon Mountain? Ning had never treated them as his number one
priority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
three days passed within that room of ice. The dire-ice in Ning’s
body, after having been nourished by the ancient glacial ice, was now
significantly larger, and had reached the eighth grade. However, only
the early grades would progress this quickly; the farther along it
went, the slower it would become. Some types of dire-ice with weaker
potential would have no hope at all of reaching the first grade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
towards the nearby Northson. Northson was opening his eyes. “Ah,
success,” Ning said. “Right.” Northson’s eyes were filled
with delight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woody,” Qingqing
said, “I’ve prepared a gift for you. Consider it a congratulatory
gift for implanting that dire-ice.” “A gift? For me?” Northson
was instantly astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yep,” Qingqing
nodded smugly. Within her dainty hand, a fairly small wooden box
appeared. Upon seeing the size of the wooden box, Ning instantly
clapped his hand to his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Qingqing
opened the wooden box up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancient glacial
ice!” Northson instantly called out in surprise. Earlier, he had
focused all of his attention on implanting the dire-ice, and hadn’t
been able to divide his attention at all. Naturally, he had paid no
attention to the conversations going on outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced out of the
corner of his eyes at the chest. That piece of ancient glacial ice
within the ‘small’ chest was merely half a foot long. Qingqing
hurriedly looked towards Ning, winking at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I accept…”
Northson began, but Ning rose and interjected, “Just take it. After
you take it, we’ll head out immediately and go to the earthfire
vein.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slightly more than half
of the nearby dire-ice vein was left. Ning could go find other
Wanxiang Adepts and engage in a trade…but the two group battles in
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, one against those six
Wanxiang Adepts, the other against those ten-plus Wanxiang monsters,
had quickly taught Ning something. Given his current level of power,
when adventuring in the outside world, it wouldn’t be too hard for
him to acquire treasures. He really didn’t need to waste his time
conniving and scheming on potential trades with one or two Wanxiang
Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a desolate
mountain. A Xiantian monster was standing guard here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Majesty ordered
me to go patrol and investigate the various mountains for that human
cultivator. The wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains have so many
mountains. Who knows which one the human cultivator has gone to? How
could I possibly be so lucky as to run into them while patrolling
this mountain?” A yellow-haired monster was leaning against a giant
rock. As a Xiantian monster, he would’ve been a minor figure even
in the Swallow Mountain region. Here, in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains, he was an even more minor figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two human youths
actually caused King Dragonwhale to suffer such a loss.” The
yellow-haired monster still clearly remembered the contents of the
letter. The water-imprinting technique had been used to duplicate
thousands of copies of the leather parchment scrolls which the
Dragonwhale had sent out. All of the Xiantian monsters had seen the
contents, and they had all memorized it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light
suddenly flew through the clouds, charging towards a nearby mountain.
“Is that…?!” The yellow-haired monster was instantly startled.
Upon taking a closer look, it revealed a look of shock and delight.
“No mistaking it. That’s a dragon-headed warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After seeing the
dragon-headed warship fly to the mountain, it saw three figures
disembarking; Ning, Northson, and Qingqing. And then, the three of
them disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that mountain
over there. There are no monsters nearby, just a few minor monsters
who aren’t worthy of concern,” Qingqing said. The dragon-headed
warship instantly dove downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spread out his
divine sense to encompass a range of three hundred kilometers. This
was the maximum range Ning could currently search at. Upon doing
so…indeed, he saw that for hundreds of kilometers around, only
minor monsters were present; there was one that was possibly just
barely at the Zifu level, and who was painstakingly training within a
private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” They
executed their movement techniques, entering the heart of the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing led the way as
they moved through the mountain. “If we follow this tunnel, we’ll
quickly arrive at the river. If we follow the river, we’ll soon be
able to see the earthfire vein.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. Moments later,
a subterranean river appeared within the gloomy, dark underground.
The end of the river had a six meter wide crack, and within the
crack, there was a tendril of golden fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The earthfire vein.”
Ning’s eyes lit up. “That should be…goldflame earthfire!”
Ning immediately recognized it. “This is an excellent type of
earthfire as well.” Ning felt great joy in his heart, and he stared
downwards. Beneath the deep crack was a roiling river of scorching
hot lava. It made sense for the goldflame earthfire to appear here,
above a river of lava. But when Ning looked at the lava…for some
reason, he suddenly felt his heart clench!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a vague sense of
danger which something within the deep, dark regions of his soul
could sense. It was a warning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head,
no longer looking at the river of lava, and the sense of danger
instantly disappeared. “Can it be that there is a region of
shattered space below?” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning normally
looked at some twisted areas of shattered space, he would also feel
his heart clench slightly. In a place like the wild marshes of the
Gaol Mountains…situations like this were extremely common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go into the
lava. You in particular, Little Qing. Don’t charge into it rashly,”
Ning instructed. “Don’t enter the lava?” Qingqing looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “There
should be a spatial distortion or rift below. Be careful. Right; I’m
probably going to take much longer for the harvesting of earthfire,
because my body already has dire-ice in it. I need to be even more
careful in harvesting earthfire. I imagine that I’ll need anywhere
from three to six days.” Ning then sat down in the lotus position
next to the goldflame earthfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to us,”
Qingqing said. Northson added, “Don’t worry at all; relax. I’ll
go set up the formation right away.” The two of them had already
set up an alarm formation outside the mountain, and then within a few
kilometers of the goldflame earthfire vein, they set up a second
bewildering formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position. He opened his mouth, and with ‘pincers’ of
elemental ki, he guided the goldflame earthfire directly into his
mouth and into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthfire and dire-ice
were polar opposites. Because Ning already had dire-ice in his body,
he had to be incomparably careful when absorbing earthfire into his
body…if any of it leaked out and if the earthfire and dire-ice
interacted with each other, there would be an explosion. Even if Ning
was able to survive, thanks to his Fiendgod body, his Zifu region
would still probably be completely ruined. Even if he was lucky and
it wasn’t destroyed, it would still be badly damaged to the point
where he would be like his father, never able to advance at all as a
Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning couldn’t
possibly give up this opportunity because of such a minute risk. The
path of Immortals was always one in which one would fight for any
chance to become an Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
three days passed. The Xiantian monster had painstakingly run back to
report, and then the Zifu monster had personally gone to Dragonwhale
Peak to make the report. “King Dragonwhale, this is the map.. Three
days ago, those humans you are chasing after, your Majesty, appeared
in this area.” A black-furred bear monster was speaking with great
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over here?” The
Dragonwhale sat on his throne, staring at the map in his hands. He
quickly understood the location. “Very good. Go back and tell old
Wolf that he helped me this time, and I’ll remember it.” The
Dragonwhale’s voice boomed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
black-furred bear monster bowed respectfully, then immediately
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale’s
shadowy green eyes were filled with a murderous intent, and the aura
from his body was more than ten times as violent as it was in the
past. After becoming a Primal Diremonster…his power had naturally
increased dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother.” The
two bison-type Diremonsters standing nearby both looked towards their
king. “I’m going to kill that human brat. My two brothers, for
now, look after Dragonwhale Peak,” the Dragonwhale instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, Big
Brother. Leave everything here to us,” the two bison-type
Diremonsters replied. “Then just wait for me to return and drink
celebratory wine.” The Dragonwhale let out a savage laugh, and then
its body disappeared from the cavern estate with a flash. Soon, an
azure streak of light appeared in the skies, streaking towards and
disappearing into the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a green leaf,
there were three Wanxiang Adepts who were soaring through the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Dong
One, have we reached that place where you said you found the
earthfire vein?” A bald, black-robed woman was speaking in a
pressing manner. Her face was covered with red tattoos, and she
looked quite devilish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
don’t worry. I’ve sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. What
have you to fear?” The golden-robed Dong One smiled as he spoke.
“The earthfire vein is in an extremely secretive place…even that
cave within the mountain is extremely remote and hard to find. I only
encountered it through luck; I trust that within such a short period
of time, no one else should have been able to find it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One was in a
splendid mood, because he had traded the location of this earthfire
vein for quite a few treasures. But of course, this was just an
agreement; both sides had sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.
Only when they actually reached the earthfire vein would they give
him the items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are. It’s
that short mountain below us.” Dong One pointed downwards through
the clouds, where a short, squat mountain could vaguely be seen.
“That desolate, short mountain over there. Not even monsters can be
bothered with taking over that place. It’s quite unremarkable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the two
Wanxiang Adepts next to him, one male and one female, were filled
with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,” Dong
One said confidently, and then he controlled the flying treasure to
descend rapidly.
</P>

Chapter 30 - Hunted
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
subterranean region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position. Wisps of earthfire were unceasingly being
absorbed into his Zifu region. The glow of the goldflame earthfire
within the crack in the ground was now much weaker than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Northson’s
face suddenly changed. “What is it?” Qingqing hurriedly looked
towards him. “A person has arrived!” Northson’s face was now
quite solemn. “It could also be a monster. Either way, some form of
lifeform has barged into the mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, they had set
down an alarm formation within the mountain. Since alarm formations
were meant to warn the user, they naturally were hidden extremely
well, to the point where they didn’t cause any elemental ki ripples
at all. Anyone who barged into the region would unconsciously
activate the alarm formation. However, there was no way for Northson
to know exactly who had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate the
bewildering formation,” Northson instructed. “Even if it is a
Wanxiang Adept or Diremonster who has come…even if they enter the
underground river region, from a distance, they will be baffled and
affected by the bewildering formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Qingqing
hurriedly activated the formation which Ning had given her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wanxiang Adept of
Snowdragon Mountain, Dong One, was currently in an excellent mood,
and he led these two other Adepts down towards the underground river
in a very practiced manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really is quite
hidden,” the nearby, bald, black-robed woman laughed. The bald,
white-robed man by her side nodded. “One can only enter this
mountain through movement arts…if one didn’t have a divine sense,
one really wouldn’t be able to find this place and enter. Fellow
Daoist Dong, how did you enter this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are mistaken.”
Dong One shook his head. “There is an extremely well-hidden
entrance to the insides of this mountain from the outside world. I
found it by accident, but I’ve already destroyed that entrance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, so that’s the
situation.” The two bald Adepts both nodded. Soon, the three of
them reached the river. “Look.” Dong One pointed towards the
distance. If we follow that river and constantly advance, we will
shortly be able to see the earthfire vein.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After we discover
the earthfire vein, we two fellow disciples will carry out our
promise.” The bald, white-robed man smiled. “Good.” Dong One
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three advanced at
high speed along the river. A short while later, Dong One suddenly
stretched his hand out and barked, “Halt.” The man and woman
looked towards him. “What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s
wrong.” Dong One frowned as he stared forward. “Logically
speaking, by now, we should be able to see the earthfire in the
distance. But I can’t see it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The two
Adepts were both shocked. The female one barked fiercely, “You are
playing us!” But her white-robed senior apprentice-brother shook
his head. “Don’t be hasty. Fellow Daoisti Dong has already sworn
an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. He shouldn’t have lied to us…and
I can vaguely sense elemental ki ripples from up ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ripples?” Dong One
and the black-robed woman both looked towards him. “Yes.” The
white-robed man nodded. “Let’s continue to move forward. You’ll
be able to sense it soon as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redleaf [Hongye]
lives up to his reputation,” Dong One sighed in amazement to
himself. “The genius disciple of the Bloodlotus Monastery! The
power and sensitivity of his soul is far superior to mine.” The
reason why he had chosen these two was precisely because he knew that
Redleaf was extremely powerful; if he hadn’t been delayed by other
matters, he probably would’ve become a Raindragon Guard long ago.
Redleaf definitely had many magic treasures; knowing this, Dong One
chose to trade with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They advanced by
another half-kilometer. By now, both Dong One and the woman could
sense the elemental ki ripples as well. “That’s a bewildering
formation,” the white-robed Redleaf said softly. “In addition, it
is an extremely complicated one. It seems, fellow Daoist Dong, that
another Immortal cultivator came after you left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!? What were the
chances of that!?” Dong One gritted his teeth. But of course, he
had no idea that even before he came, the Azure Skysnake had already
discovered this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This bewildering
formation is an Earth-ranked magic treasure, and the user should be
at the Wanxiang level,” Redleaf sent mentally to them. “In
addition…generally speaking, only Wanxiang Adepts will go harvest
this type of earthfire. If my guess is correct, they’ve already
discovered our arrival. However, since they haven’t moved to
attack, they probably aren’t confident in being able to beat us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Dong One
and the black-robed woman both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait a bit.
Let me break this formation,” Redleaf said. “The two of you stay
outside. You are not to enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
senior apprentice-brother,” the black-robed woman said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redleaf’s eyes were
filled with complete confidence. And then, he walked to enter the
bewildering formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the bewildering
formation. “That’s Dong One, Redbud [Hongrui], and Redleaf!”
Through the bewildering formation, Northson quietly peered towards
the three figures who were flying down through the distant river.
Upon seeing this, he was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are they?”
Qingqing hurriedly asked. “Dong One is of Snowdragon Mountain.
Redbud and Redleaf are two disciples from the Bloodlotus Monastery,”
Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the two were
chatting amongst each other, the nearby Ning, who was in the middle
of harvesting the earthfire while seated in the lotus position, began
to grow anxious. Because of how incomparably strong his soul was,
even stronger than those of many Primal Daoists, he didn’t have to
completely block off his six senses while implanting earthfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong One? Redbud?
Redleaf?” A thought came to Ning’s mind. “These three…when we
all reported our names and titles at the Crimson Dragon Mountains,
when Redleaf reported his name, all the Wanxiang Adepts were shocked.
Clearly, this Adept Redleaf is an extraordinary figure. I have to
speed it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
been extremely cautious, making safety his top priority. However, in
reality, he was capable of going a good deal faster, while just
increasing the level of danger very slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb!” One wisp
of earthfire after another entered Ning’s mouth and his Zifu
region. Within his Zifu region, the amount of earthfire within the
‘earthfire island’, which was far away from the ‘dire-ice
island’, was beginning to grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation,
Redleaf walked forward while calling out in a high voice, “I don’t
know which fellow Daoist is within this formation, but I would like
to ask you to collect it. We can negotiate things peacefully. But if
you aren’t willing to do so and force me to break this formation,
then we’ll have to shed all pretense of cordiality.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redleaf.” An icy
voice rang out from within the formation. “Leave obediently. If you
really break this formation, then we’ll fight to the death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whose voice is
that?” Adept Redleaf frowned. The distant Dong One and Redbud
frowned as well, because they were very familiar with the voices of
every single member of the hundred who had joined this Raindragon
Guard trial, but they couldn’t tell whose voice this was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he can call me
out by name, he definitely is one of the hundred,” Redleaf mused to
himself. “Since he intentionally disguised his voice, and tried to
frighten me off by saying we would fight to the death…hmph, if he
was actually powerful, why would he have to use these techniques?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Redleaf calmly
stepped directly into the bewildering formation. Upon doing so, the
surrounding space instantly grew chaotic. A bewildering fog drifted
everywhere, and it became difficult to even tell the directions.
Adept Redleaf stood there within the formation, taking a few casual
steps forward. After attuning himself to the transformations of the
formation, he instantly began to laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, fellow Daoist Dong, I’ll definitely break this
formation within two hours.” Adept Redleaf’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One minute after
another passed. Murderous auras began to emite from Northson and
Qingqing. “Three in total,” Northson said with a growl.
“Qingqing, you take care of that woman, who seems to be the
weakest. Leave the other two to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you handle it?”
Qingqing looked at him. “Don’t worry. I also have some things
which Master bestowed upon me which I’ve never used. When the time
comes, I’ll definitely annihilate both of them with one blow. Do
you think that we disciples of the Black-White College are so easily
antagonized?” A cold light was flashing in Northson’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. Even
I’ve heard of the famous reputation of the Black-White College.
Supposedly, every single member is a supreme genius.” Qingqing
nodded. “Leave that woman to me, then…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson and Qingqing
were incomparably cautious, preparing to battle at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb!” Ning
began to absorb the earthfire at an even more rapid pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive body of the
Dragonwhale King had appeared in the air above this squat mountain.
It stared down towards the mountain, its dark green eyes filled with
a heaven-shaking killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right here? Human
brat, Ji Ning, I hope you are still here!” The Dragonwhale King
sent out his will. Boom! A vast, rolling wave of divine sense
instantly spread out in every direction. It had trained for more than
ten thousand years, after all; its soul was incomparably powerful,
and its Dao-heart was also very resilient. Thus, upon becoming a
Primal Diremonster…after but a single day, he had acquired divine
sense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some Primal Daoists
would need six months or a year to acquire their divine sense after
their breakthrough. If one’s foundation was insufficiently stable,
then the rate at which one would acquire divine sense would naturally
be slower. Someone like Ji Ning, who possessed a divine sense at the
Zifu level…could only be described as an utter monster. It was no
wonder that so many believed him to be a reincarnated Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale’s
divine sense spread out to a range of a hundred kilometers,
completely covering the short mountain below. “Eh? Nobody?” The
Dragonwhale King frowned. “Wait; that mountain actually has an
alarm formation within it.” The divine sense could see everything
within its range with perfect clarity. Although not even Redleaf or
Dong One had been able to discover the alarm formation, the
Dragonwhale King had effortlessly discovered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There must be
someone there.” The Dragonwhale King instantly charged tens of
kilometers downward, towards the short mountain below. And then, with
a single blinking movement, moved deeper inside the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
The Dragonwhale once more spread its divine sense. “Hahaha…” A
look of savage joy instantly appeared on the Dragonwhale’s face.
This time, he effortless detected that less than a hundred kilometers
away, close to an underground river, there were several human
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That human brat, Ji
Ning, is harvesting earthfire? And there is a human cultivator who is
outside a formation, trying to break it?” The Dragonwhale laughed
coldly. “These humans are actually fighting amongst themselves…how
laughable. Unfortunately…all of them shall die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will set down a
massive spacelock sealing formation outside, and then kill them all.”
The Dragonwhale immediately began to carry out his plan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the humans had
detected the arrival of the Dragonwhale. The Dragonwhale had
intentionally avoided the alarm formation. The only person who was
aware of his arrival…was Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Dragonwhale’s
divine sense had swept out towards him, Ning’s own divine sense had
naturally detected it. After all, in terms of just divine sense, Ning
was even more formidable than the Dragonwhale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine sense?”
Ning was shocked. “A Primal Daoist? Or a Primal Diremonster?”
Ning was truly stunned. Ning slowed down his absorption of the
earthfire, and with a single thought, instantly spread his divine
sense out towards every direction. He instantly discovered the
Dragonwhale King, who had already moved to the skies above the short
mountain. The Dragonwhale King was currently planting formation flags
everywhere, preparing a spacelock sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…human
brat?” The Dragonwhale sensed Ning’s divine sense. Instantly, he
sent through divine sense, “I have to thank you. If it hadn’t
been for you, how could I have broken through to become a Primal so
easily? Hahaha, to thank you, I will annihilate all of those humans
who are planning to act against you. But of course, all of you will
die as well. Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale
instantly used his blinking movement technique to go inside the
mountain once more. He soon arrived at the underground river, then
charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
Dong One and Redbud were outside the formation, watching as Adept
Redleaf was striving to defeat the formation from within it. “The
Wanxiang Adept within the formation is dead for sure.” Redbud’s
eyes were filled with eagerness. “Right.” Dong One was eager as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One had no
idea…that within the formation were the two people he feared the
most; Ji Ning and Mu Northson. And, at this moment, a Dragonwhale
King was charging straight towards him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all…the surrounding area was completely sealed by a spacelock
sealing formation. There was no way to flee at all.

Chapter 31 - Vengeance in the Next Life
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One and Redbud
were both outside the formation, waiting. “Eh?” The two of them,
as though having sensed something, turned to look behind them, only
to see in the gloomy darkness a massive, muscular figure surging
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a giant figure
that was two stories high. Clearly, this wasn’t a body which a
normal human being could possess, and it wasn’t attempting to hide
whatsoever the savage, monstrous aura which poured out wantonly from
it. Its two sinister green eyes seemed to carry a lofty, arrogant
look within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?”
Redbud barked. But Dong One said cautiously, “Monster, hurry up and
leave. We don’t want to kill any monsters right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t want to
kill monsters, but I want to kill humans right now.” The
Dragonwhale King was incomparably relaxed right now; a sort of
relaxation that came only when one had an absolute advantage in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill humans?” The
faces of Dong One and Redbud changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to blame
someone, blame that brat, Ji Ning.” After finishing his words, a
giant black sword, wreathed by a river of golden flames, stabbed
directly towards Redbud and Dong One.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The two
of them were completely baffled, but in the face of this attack from
the giant black sword, they didn’t have any time to ponder; they
hurriedly prepared to battle the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-robed woman, Redbud, suddenly waved her hand, and two blood-red
silk ribbons slashed through the air. While flying, they appeared to
be two dragons of blood, and emitting draconic roars, they swept
towards that giant black sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freeze.” Dong One
pointed towards the distance, and his dire-ice swept forward,
preparing to freeze and lock that giant sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!” Like a hot
knife going through butter, the giant black sword easily dispersed
both of the blood dragons. The golden flames on the surface of the
giant black sword appeared incomparably brilliant…they effortlessly
dissipated the dire-ice, and in an instant, appeared in front of the
body of the bald, black-robed Rosebud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
Redbud hurriedly leapt backwards, transforming into a streak of light
and about to retreat as an azure bell suddenly appeared in her hands.
However, the golden flames on that giant black sword suddenly
expanded, and with a boom, it instantly enveloped Redbud. “No!!!”
A miserable, agonized scream. Bathed in golden flames, Redbud howled
in agony, and then her body was instantly charred to ash. Even her
divine soul was burnt into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
earthfire is this?!” Dong One was so terrified, his face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister!” Adept Redleaf, within the formation, heard that
miserable scream coming from the outside. He grew frantic. “Dong
One, what happened to my junior apprentice-sister?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, earthfire?”
The Dragonwhale King let out a cold laugh. “This is Primal Fire!”
Dong One’s face completely changed, and the face of Adept Redleaf,
within the formation, changed as well. Primal Fire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just from looking at
the surface of the flames, it was hard to tell; after all, there were
more than a hundred types of earthfire, including gold, white, green,
and all sorts of other flames. It was quite hard to differentiate
them. Primal Fire, however…was the flame which the Primal
Turtle-Snake naturally generated. Its power was tremendous; most
likely, earthfire would have to be cultivated to the third grade
before being able to compete against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s dead. Now,
you can die as well.” With but a thought, the Dragonwhale King sent
his flying sword chopping towards Dong One. This was a Heaven-ranked
flying sword, which it had acquired by luck. Given its power,
acquiring an ordinary Heaven-ranked flying sword wasn’t too
difficult. Although it wasn’t very skilled at using flying swords,
since it had become a Primal Daoist, it was able to fill this flying
sword with his Primal-level elemental ki, and also fill it with his
Primal Fire. Thus, the power of this attack was absolutely comparable
to the power of his Fiendgod divine ability attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, I ran
into a disciple of the Black-White College who could use a divine
will attack. This time, I ran into a Primal Diremonster. Why am I so
unlucky?!” Dong One’s face was ashen. Gritting his teeth, he
instantly transformed into a streak of bloody light. Swoosh! He
quickly moved far away with an evasion technique, moving so fast that
even the Dragonwhale was slightly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I
prepared a spacelock sealing formation long ago.” The Dragonwhale
King shook its head and laughed coldly. With but a single step, it
moved tens of kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Dragonwhale King
went chasing after Dong One, Adept Redleaf, within the formation, had
an ugly look on his face. “Junior apprentice-sister died? A Primal
Diremonster appeared?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the fog, Adept
Redleaf gritted his teeth, then produced a long, black weaver’s
shuttle in his hands. This black shuttle emanated an evil, ancient
aura; this was a treasure for escape which Adept Redleaf had
discovered when adventuring, which had been passed down from the
Fiendgod Era. Its name was the ‘Lightspeed Shuttle of the Nine
Heavens and Ten Hells’. Upon using it, one’s speed would become
incredibly fast, and the tips of the shuttle itself were extremely,
shockingly strong as well, capable of effortless piercing through
even a towering mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after using it
a single time, the shuttle’s power would be exhausted, and he would
have to wait ten more years before the power would regenerate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No other choices.”
Adept Redleaf immediately willed it to activate. Swoosh! The evil
black shuttle suddenly increased massively in size, while the Adept
himself hid himself within it. Swish! The long black shuttle
instantly transformed into a streak of light, moving with such
astonishing speed that the tiny bewildering formation wasn’t able
to impede it in the slightest. It easily passed through the
formation…and then, moving like a streak of black lightning, it
effortless pierced through the rocky mountain, then stabbed against
the edges of the sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch! It pierced
directly through…and then, moving at high speed, disappeared into
the distant wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One, who had been
hoping to flee, stared at the grand sealing formation. Instantly, he
despaired; he had already tried to attack it twice, but hadn’t been
able to do anything to it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” The Dragonwhale King suddenly appeared. Its two
dragon-whiskers suddenly appeared, wreathed in blazing embers of
Primal Fire as they swept towards Dong One.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of utter despair
was on Dong One’s face. Although he had protective treasures, they
would only be able to endure for a brief moment. If he wasn’t able
to escape this formation, the end result was still a single word;
death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you have to blame
someone, blame that brat, Ji Ning,” the Dragonwhale King said with
a cold laugh. “You are just the starting courses…eh? One of you
actually fled? What sort of a treasure was that long shuttle? It was
so fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite his extensive
experience, even he had never heard of this ancient treasure which
had been passed down since the Fiendgod Era, the ‘Lightspeed
Shuttle of the Nine Heavens and Ten Hells’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why should I blame
Ji Ning?” Dong One roared in fury, “If I have to die, let me die
knowing why.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale King
stared in astonishment at the human cultivator before him. “Can it
be that you don’t know that the person within the formation is that
brat, Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is inside
the formation?” Dong One stared. But…but but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had known that it
was Ji Ning inside the formation, he would have immediately fled
without saying a second word. Last time, the six of them, despite
joining forces, had all fallen to Ji Ning and his fellow disciple.
Why would he try to act against Ji Ning yet again? But Ji Ning hadn’t
said a single word…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You damnable,
detestable Ji Ning! In this life, you doomed me, but in the next
life, I’ll take my revenge!” A wild, berserk look appeared on
Dong One’s face. BOOM! As the dragon-whiskers swept forward, his
entire body instantly blew apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that the
opponent was a Primal Daoist, and had no intentions of allowing the
Primal Fire to burn him to death, because if it did, even his divine
soul would be burnt to ashes. That meant his soul would be destroyed!
If he committed suicide, at least he would be able to rejoin the
cycle of reincarnation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A straightforward
death.” The Dragonwhale King actually didn’t care at all. With a
wave of its hand, it collected the treasures which Dong One had left
behind, but it couldn’t be bothered to actually flip through them.
With a leap, it once more charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated there
in the lotus position, one wisp of earthfire after another being
absorbed into his Zifu. His absorption speed was so fast that the
nearby Qingqing and Northson both felt their hearts race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is my senior
apprentice-brother doing? Is he alright?” Northson was worried.
Qingqing looked towards Ning as well. “Master wishes to finish
implanting the earthfire as quickly as possible.” And indeed, Ning
was going all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, during the
last three days, he had already absorbed quite a bit of the
earthfire. Just now, when Adept Redleaf and the others had come to
break the formation, Ning had immediately begun to accelerate the
absorption process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally have
enough earthfire.” Ning could no longer be bothered with anything
else. “Condense!” The thousands of stars, the Jade Rabbit, and
the Golden Crow within his Zifu region all emanated countless rays of
light which descended upon the earthfire island, as though creating a
giant barrier which completely covered all of it. The earthfire
quickly began to swirl and merge into the runes atop it, causing them
to transform into gold. Crackle! Atop the earthfire island, a tiny
little golden flame was suddenly born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief. Opening his eyes, he glanced at his junior
apprentice-brother and Little Qing. Ning’s forehead and back were
all covered with cold sweat. Towards the very end, he really was
going all out in absorbing earthfire. That sort of absorption speed
was truly deadly; it was as though he had been dancing atop a steel
wire. The slightest mistake, and he’d fall off. However, with a
Primal Diremonster outside, Ning had no other choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what’s going on outside?” Northson hurriedly
asked, “I saw that Adept Redleaf, who had been in our bewildering
formation, has already escaped, and there was a battle outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the
Dragonwhale,” Ning said grimly. “Dragonwhale?” Qingqing said,
shocked, “The Dragonwhale Diremonster we ran into last time? But
just now, I heard the words ‘Primal Fire’ coming from outside;
can it be that the Dragonwhale has already broken through to become a
Primal Direfiend?” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing and Northson’s
hearts instantly turned cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unlike Adept Redleaf,
Ning and Northson had just left their schools; they had spent very
little time adventuring outside, and the treasures they had on them
were limited to what their schools had given them. They didn’t have
any strange treasures, like the ‘Lightspeed Shuttle of the Nine
Heavens and Ten Hells’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The grand sealing
formation is still just an Earth-ranked magic treasure,” Ning sent
mentally. “Although it is now a Primal Diremonster and has
activated it with Primal-level elemental ki…there is a limit to the
power of the seals. If I strike it at full power, I might be able to
break through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I have a guardian construct which Master gave me;
it can burst forth with the power of a Primal Daoist for a short
period of time. It should be able to break through the formation.
However, this guardian construct can only battle for ten breaths,
after which it will instantly disintegrate, because the materials it
was made out of were ordinary,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt relieved. It
made sense; his own master, Immortal Diancai, had also given him two
protective items. Daoist Jadefine doted even more dearly on her
apprentice, Northson. In addition, she specialized in the Dao of
Constructs…some truly monstrous constructs were capable of battling
opponents at a higher level. It was only natural for his junior
apprentice-brother to have some protective treasures as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” A deep
voice laughed out. “Ji Ning, brat, you were so smug and brash last
time; did you think that a day like this would come? Ten thousand
years of training…it all came to a head, and I broke through to the
Primal level. Now, killing you will be much easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill me? When we
battled, you survived because of how fast you fled,” Ning said
coldly. “Although you have become a Primal, you’ve only recently
broken through; I imagine your power isn’t too ridiculously great
yet. I still am capable of killing you! We disciples of the
Black-White College specialize in battling those at a higher level
than us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College?” The Dragonwhale King was slightly startled, but then it
sneered. It had a Fiendgod’s body, a divine ability, and was a
Primal Diremonster that had exceptionally superlative talents. Why
would it worry about a Wanxiang Adept?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you leave now,
you can keep your life. Otherwise…” Ning stared towards the
outside; the Dragonwhale King was standing right outside the
formation. To the two of them, both of whom possessed the divine
sense, bewildering formations were completely useless.
</P>

Chapter 32 - Awoken
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing, pack up
the bewildering formation,” Ji Ning instructed. This bewildering
formation was of no use at all against the Dragonwhale King; it would
only baffle themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation vanished.
The massive, bulky body of the Dragonwhale King could now be seen,
standing off in the distance. The aura of the Dragonwhale King was
now clearly far more savage and explosive than it had been in the
past. In his subconscious…Ning felt a sense of danger. This was a
warning from his divine soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to thank you
for helping me break through to become a Primal. Thus, I helped you
kill those two humans. They should be your enemies, yes?” The
Dragonwhale looked at Ning disdainfully, then said, “My brothers
and sisters all died in the hands of you three. And you, Ji Ning…you
deserve death more than anyone else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
Dragonwhale’s eyes flashed with cold light. Swoosh! A giant black
sword, thirty meters long, almost the size of a warship, chopped
directly towards Ji Ning, the surface of the sword covered with the
swirling flames of Primal Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Seeing
this, Ning let out a cold snort, while at the same time, his own
divine sense sent out the [Soulshaker Art]. The rolling waves of
divine will swept forward like a flood, viciously striking against
the Dragonwhale’s Primal soul! Rumble…the Dragonwhale felt its
Primal soul shudder, and the power of its magic treasures was
noticeably lowered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the
Dragonwhale to be secretly shocked; how did this Ji Ning have such a
powerful soul? Could he be a reincarnated Immortal? But even if he
was, he still had to die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaaargh!” The
giant black sword, carrying Primal Fire, howled as it flew towards
Ning. Ning let out an angry roar, and his body instantly expanded as
he transformed into a ten meter high giant. The Darknorth swords in
his hands transformed into a blur as they moved to engage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Sword-light and
the giant black sword collided in midair. Ji Ning, after using the
[Starseizing Hand], had released incredibly great power with this
sword attack, and was able to forcibly knock the giant black sword
backwards, while he himself took two steps back. At the same time,
the Waterflame Lotus appeared around his body. The petals of this
breathtakingly beautiful lotus now contained both snowy dire-ice and
golden earthfire…causing its power to increase dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dragonwhale, you
want to rely on magic treasures alone to kill me? You are looking
down on me a bit too much,” Ning laughed loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale noticed
this as well. This Ji Ning’s power was far beyond that of those
other two Wanxiang Adepts, especially in close quarters combat; he
was exceedingly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you wish, then.”
The Dragonwhale King let out a massive howl, and instantly, its
entire body transformed into a heaven-filling fog, but then, next to
that underground river, its body began to transform into its true
form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly sent to
the nearby Northson and Qingqing, “Junior apprentice-brother,
Little Qing, once this Dragonwhale takes its true form, it’ll cause
the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter; the surrounding
parts of the mountain will definitely be shattered. I’ll battle
against him and hold him off; you two, hurry up and go break out of
this sealing formation. Junior apprentice-brother, use whatever means
you must in order to break through the formation and uproot the
formation flags. Once the formation is gone, I’ll have plenty of
ways to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson hesitated
momentarily, then nodded. “Fine. Senior apprentice-brother, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Ning lowered his head, glancing sideways his junior
apprentice-brother and Qingqing. After having transformed into a
giant due to the ‘Heavenly Transformation’ divine ability, it
really did feel a bit odd interacting with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true form of the
Dragonwhale was beginning to take shape in this subterranean cavern.
Its body was simply too vast, while the caverns were too small. After
having used its divine ability, it was ten thousand meters in length,
while its body was many hundreds of meters wide. For such an enormous
body to be squeezed into a mountain cavern meant that the surrounding
mountain itself would begin to split apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break apart!” The
Dragonwhale felt too confined and cramped as well. When it was young,
it had lived in the Darknorth Seas. After coming to this vast region,
it normally battled in the wide, spacious skies. Naturally, it
preferred wide spaces, and wasn’t very comfortable when
underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its enormous, ponderous
body began to shake violently and wriggle about, its tail slapping
about as well. Slash! It was like an earthworm flipping over, and in
the process, the mountain peak above that had taken up ten kilometers
suddenly fell over and collapsed. Many stones were knocked flying
into the skies as well. Even the earth itself was ripped apart, while
the underground river ceased to floor. The underground passage,
previously thirty meters wide, was instantly, forcibly expanded to
three thousand meters wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” Even
the boiling lava beneath them began to soar towards the skies,
belching forth in a paroxysm of fire as the river of lava itself
reversed course. The Dragonwhale’s revealing of his true form had
truly caused the heavens to split and the earth to shatter. As for
Ning, he held his twin swords in his hands, watching this as the
Waterflame Lotus bloomed about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and leave,”
Ning immediately transmitted and shouted to them, “If we get
separated, we’ll reunite at the dire-ice location.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing instantly
transformed into a small snake, wrapping herself around Northson’s
arm. As for Northson, he transformed into a streak of light, breaking
through the crumbling rocks and charging outside, moving as fast as
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, fleeing? Do
you really think you’ll escape?” The Dragonwhale’s massive
draconic head released a wild, savage laugh. The sky was now visible
from their location, and the lava around them bubbled and hissed. It
was a picture of utter chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The two
dragon-whiskers of the Dragonwhale descended in a sweeping movement
towards Ning, surrounded by Primal Fire and moving as fast as
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning’s
sword-light was especially dazzling. “BANG!” Ning’s twin swords
clashed against them, and with the collision, Ning was knocked flying
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Its power increased
by quite a bit.” Ning was sent smashing through tens of meters of
the mountain rocks, and his face changed. “Ah, right. Those
dragon-whiskers are its ‘intrinsic magic treasures’ which it
spent many years cultivating. Now that it has become a Primal, in its
true form…the power of its intrinsic magic treasures have naturally
improved dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having reverted
to its true form, the Dragonwhale’s power had increased
significantly. Even despite using the [Starseizing Hand], Ning still
felt as though he couldn’t be able to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
my power, now, is still quite a bit weaker than a Primal Daoists.”
Ning faced the Dragonwhale King, not knowing how to battle him and
trying to think of a way to delay. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world went silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The river of lava,
previously flowing in the opposite direction, came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spraying water of
the underground river froze in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stones that had
been blasted into the skies froze there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still in the
pose of executing the Windwing Evasion and retreating frantically…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was standing
in front of the grand sealing barrier, unmoving…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the incomparably
massive Dragonwhale Diremonster that was floating in the air had come
to a halt. Its dragon-whiskers that had been dancing in the air were
now frozen there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant, it was
as though everything in this region had gone still. But Ning,
Northson, the Azure Skysnake, and the Dragonwhale King, these four
living creatures, knew very well that this wasn’t the case!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Ning
could feel an incomparably powerful force instantly descend, so
powerful as to completely suppress him. He felt like an ant atop of
an iceberg, completely unable to move. He even felt as though he
couldn’t change his facial expressions. That surge of power was
simply too massive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…what is going
on?” Ning was completely stunned and uneasy. His soul was pulsing
at him, screaming of a terrifyingly great danger. Ning had the
feeling that whatever threat had appeared was capable of instantly
annihilating him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…what’s
this??!” Northson, who had just reached the grand sealing
formation, was incomparably frantic as well. In his heart, he was
also completely stunned. He felt as though he had been completely
suppressed and sealed away; he couldn’t even move a single finger.
He could also see that even the rocks in midair weren’t moving at
all, causing him to feel all the more horrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragonwhale was
stunned as well. It was a Primal Diremonster, and a Dragonwhale at
that; how incredibly great was its power? With but a single flip of
its body, it could shatter the heavens and break the earth. And yet,
in this instant, its massive body hung there in midair, completely
unable to move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
reached the Primal stage. What power is this, which is capable of
preventing me from even fighting back? Even Immortals shouldn’t be
this powerful. Can it be a Celestial Immortal? Or a Loose Immortal
who has lived for hundreds of thousands or millions of years?” The
Dragonwhale’s heart was filled with many thoughts as well, and it
too was both terrified and restless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning didn’t
move at all, he could still see. “Is that…?!” Ning suddenly
stared in astonishment as the distant, bubbling river of lava began
to part. The entire earth began to crack open, as a massive, fiery
red hand, wreathed in lava, emerged from it. This hand…just staring
at it, Ning became filled with despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was something
which occurred only when the disparity in power had reached an
unbelievable level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This palm of this
titanic hand was more than three thousand meters long, and the palm
lines were all clearly visible. These ancient, criss-crossing palm
lines appeared to be carved or sculpted. As this titanic, fiery hand
stretched out from the lava, it seized the head of the Dragonwhale in
midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRUNCH.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like crushing an egg,
the titanic, fiery hand easily pinched and squished the skull of the
Dragonwhale. Although the Dragonwhale was a Fiendgod Body Refiner,
during the instant in which its head was pinched, even its soul was
crushed and dispersed. It wouldn’t even have the chance to
reincarnate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An exalted Primal
Diremonster had just died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning’s
heart was filled with incomparable shock, but his facial expressions
remained completely unchanged from earlier. Even his facial muscles
couldn’t budge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An even more
titanically massive, fiery red head suddently emerged from the
splitting lava. Right; a head! He had a single eye, a nose, and a
mouth. The size of his head alone was more than three thousand meters
tall. His entire, massive body slowly emerged from the deep abysses
of the earth. Only after half of his body was revealed did he come to
a halt. His body seemed to be formed from solidified magma, and it
emanated an incomparable, scorching aura. He glanced at the corpse of
the Dragonwhale, which now lay amongst the shattered rocks. His
single, fiery red pupil had a cold look in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A puny earthworm
actually dared to destroy my residence and disturb my slumber. He
deserved to die,” this titan rumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was unable to
reveal any expressions on his face. But in his heart, he was
screaming in shock, “Fiendgod, this is definitely a true Fiendgod!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant, Ning
could think of no other possibilities. Neither Immortals nor
Diremonsters matched this creature’s appearance. This incomparably
ancient, terrifying presence…in terms of appearance, aura, or
power, the only type of creature which matched it was a Fiendgod!
Fiendgods were born from the heavens themselves, and thus most had
incomparably vast bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were incredibly
powerful, and they had been born unfathomable ages ago, during the
Fiendgod Era!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And two humans,
along with a little snake.” This ancient Fiendgod, who had been
slumbering for who knows how long, swept his single eye to glance
towards Ning, Northson, and the Azure Skysnake, as though he were
looking at ants.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 33 - Fiendgods and Humans
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Mu Northson,
and the Azure Skysnake could feel the hint of killing intent wafting
towards them from this ancient Fiendgod. The three of them truly were
like ants before him; whether or not he killed them was truly a
trifling matter. After all, he had been sleeping happily deep beneath
the river of lava. After having been woken up, it was rather
irritated, and so the main culprit, that Dragonwhale, was the first
to die. Ning and the others were just unlucky enough to be caught up
by it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Northson,
upon feeling that killing intent, couldn’t help but feel despair in
his heart. Was he going to die?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t die. I
can’t die! I just entered the Black-White College. I swore an oath
in front of Mother’s grave…that I would make the Bluewood clan
regret what they did! I haven’t, I haven’t done anything yet. I
can’t accept this, I can’t!” Northson’s eyes were filled with
boundless panic and regret, but under that boundless pressuring
power, he couldn’t even change his facial expressions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I going to die?”
The Azure Skysnake was coiled around Northson’s arms. She was able
to see the towering, vast, ancient Fiendgod from the corner of her
eyes. The feeling that ancient Fiendgod gave her was that of the vast
universe itself; she couldn’t even bring herself to want to try to
resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s sad that I’m
going to die along with Woody. If I have to die, I should die
alongside Master,” the Azure Skysnake murmured to herself. She
looked towards Ning as well, but because the mountain was blocking
her vision, she wasn’t able to see him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning also felt as
though death was coming towards him. He had never had a strong a
feeling of impending death before; not even when he was progressing
through the three trials of the underwater estate had he felt so
powerless! He couldn’t fight back at all…this sensation of
impending death was something Ning couldn’t resign himself to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t
destroyed Snowdragon Mountain yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t even
come close to being a major power in the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother…I
want to see if they are living good lives after their reincarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And Autumn Leaf…she
must be waiting for me still.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt powerless.
Although he still had that protective brooch in front of his chest
that had been given to him by Immortal Diancai, which would release a
protective sword-ki with but a thought…it would only be able to
resist the power of a Loose Immortal or an Earth Immortal for a
single breath’s worth of time. In the face of a Fiendgod who had
killed a Primal Diremonster as easily as stepping on an ant, what
could it possibly do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate.” Ning
had bound the brooch long ago. With but a thought, Ning instantly
attempted to activate the brooch, and the protective sword-ki within
it tried to surge outside. Although it was probably useless, he had
to at least give it a shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The ancient
Fiendgod’s single eye turned to stare at Ning. That seemingly
omnipresent power seemed to completely focus on Ning as well, also
pushing down towards Ning’s brooch. The protective sword-ki within
the brooch tried to charge out, but it was pressed down upon by an
invisible, formless strength, preventing it from emerging.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was pushed back
inside!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it to
activate again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But yet again, it was
pushed back inside!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
Ning now felt truly powerless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a hint of surprise
was in the ancient Fiendgod’s single eye. He looked at Ning,
murmuring to himself, “A Sword Immortal? A Loose Immortal or an
Earth Immortal? The sword-ki is both condensed and sharp; although
it’s a bit different from that of Immortal Northwalker, who chased
me around in the past, it’s still quite astonishing. This human
brat most assuredly has a powerful Sword Immortal behind him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Sword
Immortal…most likely has other colleagues and seniors who stand
behind him as well.” The ancient Fiendgod mused to himself, “I
had best leave. I suffered miserably enough, the last time I was
chased around.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As someone who had
existed from the Fiendgod Era to the present era, he knew exactly how
terrifying the humans were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You kill a puny one, a
strong one comes. You kill the strong one, an entire host of strong
ones would come!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humans simply had far
too many experts, and they could send out entire groups of Immortals
to attack him, a single person. The countless times he had suffered
in this manner had caused him to become incomparably cautious. It was
precisely this caution which had allowed him to survive to the
present day. Otherwise, he would’ve been killed or sealed away by
the humans long ago!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, most importantly
of all, humans trained far too quickly! Fiendgods were the favored
children of the heavens. They were born with tremendous power, and
didn’t even suffer from the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations
as they naturally increased in power. Only human cultivators had to
deal with the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations! However, in
turn, Fiendgods were far slower in learning and comprehending. They
generally would spend tens or hundreds of thousands of years in
training, or even millions of years. Training, to them, took an
incomparably long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But humans? A single
human could become an Immortal in just a few centuries! A few
centuries? This was an extremely short period of time for Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had terrifying
reproductive abilities, powerful learning abilities, and a rapid rate
of advancement…this was why humans became the true leader of the
countless races of this world, and indeed, of the entirety of the
Three Realms. They were the true overlords! Even Fiendgods had to
avoid them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? And a Loose
Immortal has come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient Fiendgod
glanced towards the distant skies. It would be extremely easy for him
to kill this Loose Immortal, but did he dare? He did not, because he
knew that this Loose Immortal should be a member of the Raindragon
Guard. If he killed one of them, very soon, the Guard would send tens
or even hundreds of Loose Immortals…and perhaps even the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty would send some of its ancient,
nigh-unkillable figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
The ancient Fiendgod’s entire body instantly emerged from the
ground. With but a single step….whoosh. Space itself twisted, and
the ancient Fiendgod entered the twisting void, disappearing without
a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spraying water and
flying rocks that had previously been locked in midair finally
collapsed. For a moment, there was utter chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He left?” Ning
gawked in astonishment. And then, from the corner of his eyes, he
stared at the massive corpse of the Dragonwhale. He immediately waved
his hand, collecting the entire, massive, three thousand meter long
corpse of the Dragonwhale into his storage-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having reached
the early Wanxiang level, Ning had switched to using an Earth-ranked
storage belt. This was a spoil of war he had acquired from killing
the Wanxiang Diremonsters earlier. This belt had an enormous space
within it; however, the massive body of the Dragonwhale still took up
more than half of the space within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson ran over, excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The Azure
Skysnake transformed into an azure shadow, moving forward and coiling
herself around Ning’s arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having just
escaped from certain death, they all had somewhat changed feelings in
their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, why did that Fiendgod leave?” Northson
hurriedly asked, “And why didn’t he kill us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either.” Ning shook his head. Although the Fiendgod had been
mumbling to himself, the surrounding space had been completely
locked; not even sound waves were able to move. Naturally, Ning
hadn’t heard anything. But right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blood-robed elder
suddenly appeared in the skies. This blood-robed elder had a crown on
his head, and the blood-red robes were incomparably beautiful.
However, a hint of resentment was within his gaze. “I actually let
it escape. It ran quite quickly. It can consider itself lucky.” As
soon as he had sensed the local ripples, he had immediately hurried
over here, but on the way, he had noticed that the Fiendgod had begun
to flee. He had wanted to pursue it, but unfortunately, he hadn’t
been able to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You three.” The
blood-robed elder, after appearing in midair, stared downwards
towards Ning, Northson, and the Azure Skysnake. As he did, the three
of them felt their hearts grow numb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should’ve seen
that Fiendgod emerge, just now.” The blood-robed elder’s voice
was icy cold, and slowly, the world itself around them seemed to
begin to freeze. Ning, Northson, and the Azure Skysnake all felt an
invisible pressure crush down towards them, quite similar to the
technique which the Fiendgod had previously used. However, this
pressure was far weaker than that of the Fiendgod’s. Despite that,
however, Ning’s group knew that this Immortal in front of them was
still invincible, as far as they were concerned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, what did it
look like?” The blood-robed elder pointed towards the Azure
Skysnake. “You, monster. You speak first.” A look of terror
appeared on the Azure Skysnake’s face, and she immediately said,
“It was an extremely massive Fiendgod, with a palm of more than
three thousand meters long. As for its body, it was thirty thousand
meters tall! Its body appeared to be formed from lava stones. It had
a single eye, a single nose, and a single mouth. It didn’t have
hair, and lava seemed to be flowing from its head as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of shock
appeared in the eyes of the blood-robed elder. Him? Only now did the
elder know which Fiendgod it was, and cold sweat trickled down his
back. That was too close; fortunately, he hadn’t caught the
Fiendgod, as if he had, he probably would’ve died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, he pointed
towards Northson. “You. Speak.” As soon as his words came out,
Northson felt an invisible power command his soul. Although he
remained conscious, his mouth began to speak by itself. “He emerged
from the lava beneath us. His entire body was fiery red, he bound us
with an invisible pressure that we weren’t able to resist at all.
He had a single eye, a single nose, a single mouth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You. Speak.” The
blood-robed elder pointed at Ning. Ning, too, sensed an invisible
divine will instantly invade his sea of consciousness. However,
Ning’s powerful divine will pushed back against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A soundless,
invisible collision of divine wills. Although the blood-robed elder
held an absolute advantage, he was unable to control Ning like a
puppet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Your divine soul
is this powerful?” The blood-robed elder looked towards Ji Ning.
“Which school are you from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior is Ji
Ning, disciple of the Black-White College. My master is Immortal
Diancai.” Ning continued respectfully, “Next to me is my junior
apprentice-brother, Mu Northson. This Azure Skysnake is a
spirit-beast I have recently tamed while wandering the wild marshes
of the Gaol Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Diancai?
The Black-White College?” The blood-robed elder nodded calmly, then
said in a still-cold voice, “I ask you this; when the Fiendgod
appeared…why didn’t he kill the three of you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I don’t know..”
Northson said the same thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing just shook her
head, not even daring to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed elder
knew very well that this particular, ancient Fiendgod had a strange
temper. When angered, it would occasionally kill humans. However,
because that ancient Fiendgod had always been cautious and low-key,
and had never acted to kill human Loose Immortals with powerful
backgrounds, the Grand Xia Dynasty had never put too much effort into
chasing after and capturing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had engaged in
wanton massacres and killed many influential figures, the Grand Xia
Dynasty, in its rage, might send its full might against him. In that
situation, it probably would be caught alive after just a few days!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you can
consider yourself lucky to have survived a meeting with a Fiendgod,”
the blood-robed elder barked. “However, you absolutely must not
reveal the details of this meeting. If I find out that you have, then
the Raindragon Guard will hold you accountable for it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning,
Northson, and the Azure Skysnake all acknowledged this order. The
blood-robed elder calmly waved his hand. “Then hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group didn’t
dare to tarry; they immediately boarded the dragon-headed warship,
transforming into a streak of light and leaving at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shortly after they
left, yet another person appeared. This was a silver-haired youth
with loose, unbound hair, and who also had a crown on his head.
Immediately afterwards, a muscular, armored old man appeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod emerged?”
The silver-haired youth laughed calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which Fiendgod was
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had guessed that
the emergence of this ancient Fiendgod would cause quite a stir.
Still, for now, these were problems for Immortals to deal with; they
were far from being something he could intervene in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, this time, that was far too close. We nearly died
there.” Northson let out a sigh, staring towards the clouds nearby,
then down towards the vast wilderness. “It’s so good to be
alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s so good to be
alive.” Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had truly died
like this, then that would be far too unfair. There were many things
he had yet to do!

Chapter 34 - Entering the Raindragon Guard
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship was flying through the clouds. Ji Ning and Mu Northson, faces
full of joy, were going through and binding the assorted magic
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, this Dragonwhale’s wealth was far greater than
the wealth of those four Wanxiang Adepts we killed,” Northson said,
incomparably excited. “Previously, we killed more than ten Wanxiang
Diremonsters, but all their wealth combined…can’t match up to
this single Dragonwhale.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. The
Dragonwhale King had roamed the world for ten millennia, and had even
escaped from Primal Daoists on numerous occasions, then had advanced
to the Primal stage itself,” Ning said. “And it just broke
through to the Primal level. If it had spent a thousand years
training at the Primal level, its wealth would be even more
astonishing. However, a Primal Diremonster who had been training at
the Primal level for a thousand years…I probably wouldn’t be able
to block it at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson immediately
shook his head. “Even a Primal who had trained for a thousand years
would perish upon encountering that ancient Fiendgod! And you were
quite fast with your hands, senior apprentice-brother; as soon as the
Fiendgod left, you immediately collected this massive corpse of the
Dragonwhale. The Loose Immortal who came afterwards didn’t notice
anything; if he had, he probably would’ve taken it with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
He, too, felt that he had been quite clever. Still…this Dragonwhale
King truly did possess an astonishing amount of wealth. There had
been eight magic treasures stored in its Zifu region, and upon the
Dragonwhale’s death, they had fallen to the ground alongside its
corpse. Two were Earth-ranked storage treasures, four were
Earth-ranked magic treasures, while two were Heaven-ranked magic
treasures. Those two Heaven-ranked magic treasures alone were worth
thousands of kilograms of liquefied elemental essence! Ning and
Northson were currently binding the storage-type treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many magic
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What treasure is
this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And here are other
storage-type treasures. These should have belonged to Adept Dong One
and Adept Redleaf. Keep searching!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s a bottle of
liquefied elemental essence. Wow, three hundred kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine this one
must be quite excellent. It should be the protective magic treasure
of Adept Dong One. He previously relied on it to escape from my
attacks; I didn’t expect that he would end up dying in the hands of
this Dragonwhale, and his treasure would fall into my hands…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
sorted through one magic treasure after another, appraising their
value. The nearby Qingqing, in turn, picked up a few in curiosity.
She was a Diremonster, after all…and one who hadn’t been training
for too long. She naturally wasn’t able to assess the value of many
unique, peculiar magic treasures. Thus, all she could do was stand
next to them and celebrate with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve finished
searching them.” Ning let out a long sigh of relief. “That was
awesome.” Northson’s eyes were glowing with delight, and he
chortled, “Senior apprentice-brother, I really am beginning to
admire you more and more. This Dragonwhale corpse you picked up…I
admire you so much, I could prostrate myself before you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
“Anything you need?” Northson took a careful glance, then shook
his head and said, “None of them are on the Dao of Constructs.
There really isn’t anything I need in particular.” Ning shook his
head as well. “Nothing for I need either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong One’s protective
treasure wasn’t bad, but its power was only ordinary; in the face
of a Primal Daoist, it wouldn’t be able to hold for too long. Ning,
by relying on his own power, was already able to flee for his life in
the face of a Primal Daoist’s attacks; naturally, he wouldn’t
care too much about it. His protective sword-ki treasure was
something which could block the attacks of even a Loose Immortal or
Earth Immortal for a full breath’s worth of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s split the
liquefied elemental essence in half,” Ning said. “As for the
magic treasures, let us send them to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
and sell them, then we’ll split the revenue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you collected
them, senior apprentice-brother.” Northson stared at him, but Ning
just laughed and ‘barked’ at him, “Stop kidding around, all I
did was grab it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about me, what
about me?” The nearby Qingqing said. Ning gave her a sideways
glance. “You miser! For you, finding treasures is as easy as eating
food or drinking water. Stop fighting with impoverished cultivators
like us over treasure.” Qingqing’s hill-sized chunk of ancient
glacial ice alone was worth more than five thousand kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing instantly
pouted. “Stingy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
days after this, Ning’s group returned to the dire-ice room to
continue their training. That place was quite secretive and hidden.
After the three months came to an end, Ning’s group began their
return journey to the Raindragon Guard encampment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.” The
dragon-headed warship soared there through the clouds. Ning stood
atop the ship, staring towards the distant earth. Soon, he saw, off
in the distance, a mountain peak. It was the Raindragon Guard’s
encampment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, we’re
back. We are about to become Raindragon Guards!” Northson whooped
in delight as the warship hastened downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, no one came
to block Ning’s group. They flew directly towards the peak of the
mountain encampment, the place next to the teleportation array. Ning
instantly saw those two plainly dressed elders who stood next to the
teleportation array; it was the same two Ning had seen last time,
that skinny old man and the fat old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two more made it
back alive,” the fat elder laughed, and then his gaze fell upon the
little snake wrapped around Ning’s wrists. “A monster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
spirit-beast which I tamed in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite
formidable, young fellow. The wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains are
incomparably dangerous…it’s one thing for you to come back alive,
but you actually brought a spirit-beast back as well?” The fat
elder shook his head and sighed. “The two of you can go rest over
there and wait a while. There are still thirty or so who haven’t
arrived yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced towards
the distance in surprise. A total of just sixteen Immortal
cultivators were there, either seated or standing and chatting with
each other. Including Ning’s group, there were only eighteen
present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, how do you
know that there are thirty who have yet to arrive?” Ning asked
curiously. Northson was puzzled as well. “Right. A hundred of us
headed out; how do you know how many have died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the fat elder and
the skinny elder laughed. “Have you forgotten the talisman which
each of you bound upon entering the Crimson Dragon Mountains?” The
fat elder asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
instantly remembered; only after binding the talismans had they been
permitted to enter the Crimson Dragon Mountains, as otherwise, they
wouldn’t have been allowed in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When one of you
dies, the talisman becomes an ownerless object. Thus, we Raindragon
Guards would immediately become aware of it,” the fat elder said.
“Right now, fifty two of the talismans are in good shape, while the
others are ownerless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson now
both understood. So that tiny little talisman they had
received…actually had this secret hidden with it. The Raindragon
Guard’s methods really were unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Northson
asked, “A while ago, my senior apprentice-brother and I came back
to send some ordinary mortals here. Those ordinary mortals who had
been corralled and raised as livestock by the monsters…how are they
doing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, are they doing
alright?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fat elder said,
somewhat surprised, “Oh, it was you two who sent them over? Don’t
worry; of course they are doing alright. We Raindragon Guards will
naturally take care of those pitiable tribesmen; however, they were
teleported away long ago and left the Gaol Mountains long ago. We
Raindragon Guards will take good care of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
That was good. Only, he didn’t know…what that little kid called
‘Ironboy’ would end up like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
immediately moved with Northson to one side. With but a flick of
their fingers, they each pointed towards a boulder that had been
chopped flat. Crackle…frost appeared, instantly covering the stones
with a layer of ice. These boulders were used for the Raindragon
Guards who had come here to rest on, but with so much wind and dust
swirling about, they had naturally been quite dirty. After Ning and
Northson revealed this ability, quite a few nearby cultivators looked
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dire-ice?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, cultivators came
over to chat with the two of them. Ning and Northson chatted with
them, making quite a few friends amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One surviving
cultivator after another hurried back from locations throughout the
wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. Eastriver Cloudsoar, who both
Ning and Northson recognized, returned as well. However, Cloudsoar
returned with only one arm, and the baleful aura around him was much
stronger than it had been in the past. This caused quite a bit of
silent discussion amongst the various cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
Northson sent mentally, “In the past, Eastriver Cloudsoar was quite
the talker; why is it that he’s grown so much colder? And he’s
lost an arm…but it’s just an arm. All he needs to do is eat a
spirit-pill that allows the regeneration of limbs. In addition,
Wanxiang Adepts can also slowly regrow their arms by using their
elemental ki. Why hasn’t he done so at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
He, too, had noticed…that after this tempering experience,
Cloudsoar seemed to have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
half a day passed. More cultivators returned. “Look, Meng Liuqing!”
Northson sent mentally to Ning, “She’s the only survivor of those
six Immortal cultivators who tried to gang up on us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meng Liuqing?”
Ning saw this female cultivator of the Meng clan arrive as well. She
descended from the skies. Upon seeing Ning and Northson, her face
changed slightly. She immediately turned and was about to walk to one
side, when…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meng Liuqing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce voice rang
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Liuqing turned her
head, only to see a one-armed, white-robed youth, filled with a
baleful aura that reached the heavens, and whose eyes were filled
with an icy light. “I, Eastriver Cloudsoar, will definitely avenge
my slain younger sister. Meng Liuqing…prepare for your death! And
the other five…I won’t spare any of you!” As the disciple of
the Eastriver clan, he dared to say these words openly and directly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other five?”
Meng Liuqing shook her head. “I don’t know about Dong One, but
the other four…Northriver Zhou, Xu Manquan, Nongsan, and Jihe…are
already dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudsoar was stunned.
“Dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the surrounding
cultivators looked towards them as well. Dead? Four Wanxiang Adepts
had died? These cultivators all grew curious…what exactly had
happened?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They died in the
hands of the two disciples of the Black-White College.” Meng
Liuqing glanced sideways towards Ning and Northson. Enmity had been
created between her and the two of them; naturally, she didn’t mind
giving the two of them a bit of extra trouble. Earlier, she had
intentionally reported the names of those four, so that the friends
and family members of the four would know who had done the deed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You b*tch!”
Northson instantly rose to his feet and roared with fury,
“Previously, the six of you tried to ambush and sneak attack the
two of us. Four of you died, and now, you are still trying to plot
against us? Listen up, you b*tch! In the future, you’d best never
run into me. If I do, I’ll take your life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
stared coldly towards her as well. Unfortunately, this was the
encampment of the Raindragon Guards; no one dared to fight here. As
for Meng Liuqing, she just gave Ning and Northson a cold glance;
since there was already enmity between them, why fear this additional
threat?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists Ji
Ning and Mu Northson.” Eastriver Cloudsoar turned to look towards
Ning and Northson, then bowed deeply. “Those six didn’t go kill
Diremonsters; instead, they came to ambush and kill us, fellow
cultivators. They deserved to die in your hands, fellow Daoists. In
the future, if either of you need anything, fellow Daoists, just let
me know; I, Eastriver Cloudsoar, will definitely comply, even if I
have to go through water or climb past fire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are too
courteous. We, too, were ambushed and attacked, so we simply dealt
with them.” Ning and Northson hurriedly went over to raise
Cloudsoar from his bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, all of the
remaining, surviving cultivators had returned. Adept Redleaf returned
as well! Only, Adept Redleaf had no idea that it had been Ji Ning and
Mu Northson within that formation! Still, he had heard the
Dragonwhale King say something about ‘blame Ji Ning’, and so he
naturally gave Ning a deep look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You fifty two
survived. If you have brought back the corpse or the head of a
Wanxiang Diremonster, then you will naturally become Raindragon
Guards,” the skinny elder said. “Go. Go into the teleportation
array and return to the Crimson Dragon Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifty two
cultivators all entered the teleportation array. Soon, the array lit
up, and Ning’s group of fifty two were once more teleported back to
the Crimson Dragon Mountains, more than two million kilometers away.
