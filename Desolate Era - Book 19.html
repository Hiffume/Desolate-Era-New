Chapter 1 - The Secret History Of The Three Realms (1)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spatial whirlpool
led directly to the air above Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Redsnow,
come with me,” Subhuti instructed in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ji Ning and
Empyrean God Redsnow both obediently followed behind him. As for Snow
Scorpion, Primelight, and the other Empyrean Gods, the six of them
temporarily entered the underwater estate for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that Daoist
monastery inside Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti gracefully
landed on the ground, then sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow both
stood obediently by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow.” Subhuti
looked towards Redsnow. Smiling, he said, “Last time, when I saw
you fight in the Nihilum Zone, it didn’t seem as though you had yet
touched upon the essence of spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was due to that
battle, especially when I saw you attack, Patriarch, that I gained
some insights. I was able to join the power of time and the power of
space together, and thus able to seek out the gateway that leads to
spacetime,” Redsnow said reverently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti now understood.
When he had struck, his attack had naturally contained the countless
mysteries of spacetime within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow had been
training for countless eras; he had been just a single step away from
entering the realm of spacetime. After that life-and-death battle,
and after seeing Subhuti attack…it wasn’t strange for him to have
been inspired by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know which
person in the Three Realms has the highest level of insight into
spacetime?” Subhuti beamed merrily as he looked at Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once heard my
Manorlord say,” Redsnow said respectfully, “That you, Patriarch,
have the greatest command over spacetime in the entire Three Realms.
This is the reason why you can move about without a trace, and why
you were able to establish your Crescent world on a completely
different dimensional level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti let out a sigh.
“Threelives did indeed value you highly. He was willing to tell you
anything. Yes…my Crescent world is on a completely different
dimensional level than the rest of the Three Realms, which is why
those other Daofathers are unable to find it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…what do you
mean, ‘different dimensional level’?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Subhuti and
Redsnow were cultivators in spacetime. As for Ji Ning? He hadn’t
even gained insights into the Grand Dao of Space or the Grand Dao of
Time, to say nothing of spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you ever seen a
layer cake?” Subhuti smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other worlds of
the Three Realms all exist on the uppermost layer of a ‘layer
cake’,” Subhuti said with a laugh. “My Crescent world, however,
is in one of the other layers. Ordinary movement techniques and
Greater Teleportation techniques only allow you to move across the
uppermost surface of the layer cake…thus, no matter what you do,
you are unable to enter my Crescent world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
“So space can actually be divided into a series of layers…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven and Earth are
naturally filled with endless mysteries and marvels.” Subhuti
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…doesn’t that mean the Crescent world is the safest place of
all? Aside from you, Master, no other Daofathers can enter here.
Doesn’t this mean that you can completely avoid this great storm?”
Ning hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Subhuti shook
his head. “I cannot avoid it. I suppose I can temporarily avoid it
for now…but later on, I won’t be able to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is that? They
clearly have no way of entering this place. Why can’t you avoid
it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti pondered for a
moment, then shook his head and said, “I can’t answer your
question for now. There are many things which even I do not
understand. However, I can subconsciously sense fate working behind
the scenes to guarantee that no living creature within the Three
Realms will be able to avoid this tribulation. Ji Ning…since you
have already become a Pure Yang True Immortal, I will naturally tell
you many of the secrets of the Three Realms. But those that even I
don’t know, I naturally cannot tell you. Remember this; this vast
universe is far too mysterious. Even Mother Nuwa eventually made the
decision to enter the infinite primordial chaos in search of
answers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow.” Subhuti
looked towards Redsnow. “All of my other supreme techniques have
successors…but I have yet to find any suitable successors to my
most valuable skills, my supreme space-time arts. Are you willing to
accept me as your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow was
shocked…then overjoyed. He hurriedly fell to his knees. “Your
disciple greets you, Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Subhuti
laughed as well. “You may rise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your junior
apprentice-brother greets you, senior apprentice-brother.” After
rising, Redsnow immediately bowed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
rendered speechless. Redsnow had been born during the earliest days
of the universe, and so Ning had always respectfully addressed him as
‘senior’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For you to address
me as senior apprentice-brother…sounds really awkward,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
address each other as you please.” Subhuti smiled as he looked at
his two disciples. He was in an excellent mood today. Ji Ning’s
rate of advancement was absolutelyastounding, and Redsnow was going
to be the heir to Subhuti’s most powerful arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti laughed, “Ji
Ning has been my disciple for quite a few years, now…but I imagine
that he doesn’t even know how powerful his other fellow disciples
are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly do not
know,” Ning admitted respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that his master
had a total of nineteen disciples. If Redsnow was included, then the
total was twenty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew of the names
of every single fellow disciple, starting from their eldest
apprentice-brother, but he didn’t know exactly how strong each of
them were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you have
grown in power. As for Redsnow, he’s just a step away from becoming
a Daofather. I continue to feel as though this great storm is hiding
many mysteries within it; you fellow disciples will need to help each
other and support each other,” Subhuti said. “Of my many
disciples, a total of four have reached the True God or Daofather
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four?” Ning and
Redsnow were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first is my
eldest disciple,” Subhuti said, “Which is to say, the
wood-chopping ‘Woodcutter’ who lives in the mountains out back.
If you ever have any questions regarding cultivation, you can go ask
him about them. Without any question, he is the most powerful figure
amongst my disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second is my
second disciple, the guardian of the Three Realms Palace, the one who
is always napping; Crazy Ji.” Subhuti continued, “Crazy Ji can be
considered the disciple who has truly inherited my many techniques
and is most like myself. Buddhist techniques, Daoist techniques…he’s
learned them all. If you have any questions, you can also ask him
about them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third is my
sixth disciple, the one who created and is the master of the
Flower-Fruit Mountain world, Sun Wukong,” Subhuti said. “He once
was provided guidance by Mother Nuwa, and he is extremely skilled in
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final one is my
twelfth disciple, Blacktiger. He loves to roam about the Three
Realms. He has not established a major world of his own, has few
subordinates, and is the weakest of the four…but he’s still at
the True God/Daofather level. He has such a lazy, slothful
disposition that I only accepted him as my disciple due to ties of
karmic destiny that existed between us…but who would’ve thought
that he’d reach the Daofather level as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti introduced all
four Daofathers under his tutelage in one breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelfth
apprentice-brother Blacktiger referred to himself as ‘Great King
Blacktiger’. When Ning had been studying and training at Mount
Innerheart, Blacktiger had actually come to visit him and had even
sparred with him. Ning had never imagined or had any inkling at all
as to how powerful this man really was! The feeling that Blacktiger
had given him was that he wasn’t even as powerful as Silvermoon.
Who would’ve thought that was all just a show…that he was at the
True God/Daofather level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other disciples,
including Ji Ning, are all at the Empyrean God/True Immortal level,”
Subhuti said. “The two of you must not be lazy. The great storm has
descended upon us; if you can train to the True God/Daofather level,
you’ll have a greater chance of surviving it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ji Ning and Redsnow said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Subhuti
nodded, then smiled. “You now know how powerful your fellow
disciples are. As for some of the secrets of the Three Realms…Redsnow
may know a few, but because Ji Ning was previously weak, I hadn’t
spoken to him about them. Let me narrate some of them in detail. I
will tell you what happened during the destruction of the Primordial
Era. I trust that after you listen to me, you’ll fully understand
what the Seamless Gate truly is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow both
listened attentively. Not even Redsnow knew much about the war which
destroyed the Primordial Era.

Chapter 2 - The Secret History Of The Three Realms (2)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A reminiscent look was
in Subhuti’s eyes. He said softly, “Let us start the tale from
the dawn of the primordial chaos. Long ago, before the Primordial Era
began, our ‘Three Realms’ was located in a region of complete
primordial chaos. The primordial chaos, in and of itself, is an
incomparably marvelous thing. It began to give birth to Elder Gods,
True Gods, and Empyrean Gods. Due to them having been birthed within
the primordial chaos, they styled themselves the same way, calling
themselves the ‘Elder Gods of Primordial Chaos’ and so on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Gods?” Ji
Ning was instantly stunned by his master’s words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daos contained
within this region consisted of ten Heavenly Daos, eighty-one Grand
Daos, and 108,000 lesser Daos.” Subhuti continued, “The ten great
Elder Gods were born with control over a Heavenly Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangu, born with
control over the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa, born with
control over the Heavenly Dao of Life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi, born with
control over the Heavenly Dao of Destruction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Phoenix, born
with control over the Heavenly Dao of Yin.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancestor Dragon,
born with control over the Heavenly Dao of Yang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the Heavenly
Daos of the Five Elements, they were controlled by Firegod Zhurong,
Watergod Gonggong, Metalgod Rushou, Woodgod Jumang, and Earthgod
Houtu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These ten were all
born with innate control over the Heavenly Daos. Pangu was the
greatest of them!” 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked towards
Ji Ning. “Disciple, you seem to have many questions for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Elder Gods…your
disciples has never heard of such a thing.” Ning was stunned. “Your
disciple always believed that the True God level represented a
limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very few in the
Three Realms know of them, and I’ll explain the reason for that
later. Pangu, Nuwa, and the others are not like us. They were born
with control over the Heavenly Daos, and they are innately more
powerful than us,” Subhuti said. “In addition to them, the
primordial chaos also gave birth to powerful True Gods who were born
with control over a Grand Dao! I was one of them, as were Threelives,
Crimsonbright, Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, and
the Welcomer Buddha. All of them are True Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On a still lower
level were the 108,000 Empyrean Gods who were born with control over
an ordinary Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti continued,
“These are the Elder Gods, True Gods, and Empyrean Gods who were
born from the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most exalted and
most powerful of the gods was Pangu, born with control over the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos. Although Pangu was extremely
powerful…the invisible hands and machinations of fate worked
through him.” Subhuti let out a sigh. “He was born with the
destiny of establishing our world. He was the last to be born, and
when he emerged from the primordial chaos, he came out with his great
Pangu Axe in hand. He cleaved apart the primordial chaos itself,
separating Heaven from Earth, burning up his very lifeforce and dying
in the process. As a result…the utterly enormous Primordial Pangu’s
World was created.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After being
established…the Primordial Pangu’s World began to give birth to
many different lifeforms, all of whom were born from Heaven and
Earth. The strongest were born at the Empyrean God level, while the
weakest were at least at the Xiantian level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened
carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven and Earth
gave birth to so many incomparably exquisite things. Those of us who
emerged from the primordial chaos were filled with curiosity towards
this new world.” Subhuti sighed. “Some of us took over
territories for our own use, while others went into seclusion. As
Pangu’s World gave birth to more and more living creatures, the
world itself became an increasingly exciting place to be in. People
like Threelives began to create their own kingdoms, as did several of
the Elder Gods…and thus war began to erupt, with many being slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very common for
wars to erupt due to conflicting ambitions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various major
powers even created Ki Refining techniques for the countless living
creatures of Pangu’s World,” Subhuti said. “In fact, Tathagata
even created a completely separate system called ‘Buddhism’,
which in reality can be considered a variation on the Ki Refining
system. The various True Gods such as myself and Tathagata then were
able to train to become Daofathers, using the Ki Refining techniques
we developed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother Nuwa was the
first to break through,” Subhuti said. “Mother Nuwa possessed
tremendous willpower and wisdom. After gaining insights into the
Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang, her power instantly increased
explosively, and she then created the human race. Only then did all
the major powers of the Primordial Era understand that one’s power
could increase to a higher level once one comprehended a set of
Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, the major
powers of Pangu’s World all began to focus on training…but they
then discovered that once you mastered a particular Heavenly Dao,
mastering the opposite Heavenly Dao would be incredibly difficult.
For example, if someone who had already mastered the Heavenly Dao of
Life wished to then meditate on its opposite, the Heavenly Dao of
Destruction, the Heavenly Dao of Life itself would forcefully disturb
him. There was simply no way to gain insights at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a very long
period of time, no one aside from Mother Nuwa was capable of gaining
insights into a matching set of Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But then…Daoist
Three Purities appeared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities was born a True God of Primordial Chaos; his original name
was Yuanshi! He was extremely talented, managing to first master the
Heavenly Dao of Yang, then the Heavenly Dao of Destruction. However,
he was never able to succeed in mastering the Heavenly Dao of Yin or
the Heavenly Dao of Life, the complimentary Daos to what he already
had. And so…he steeled his mind and made a major decision.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killed himself?!”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Redsnow,
however, simply smiled. Although this was a secret, Redsnow had been
born when Pangu’s World had been created, and had followed Daoist
Threelives for many years. He knew many things, including this story.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities set down a seal upon his own truesoul, a seal that would
lock away his former memories unless he mastered either the Heavenly
Dao of Yin or the Heavenly Dao of Life,” Subhuti said. “And then,
Daoist Three Purities entered the paths of reincarnation, then killed
himself. Because he died within the paths of reincarnation, his
truesoul was naturally sent straight into the cycle of
reincarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a huge
gamble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Daoist Three
Purities’ soul was shattered in his next life, then his truesoul
would be sent to the River of Destiny. He would be finished,”
Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To seal away one’s
memories unless one mastered either the Heavenly Dao of Yin or the
Heavenly Dao of Life. In other words…unless he became a Daofather
once more, there would be no way for him to reawaken his memories
from the past. But how incredibly difficult would it have to be for
one to become a Daofather once more, without any past memories at
all? Even though one might be incredibly talented due to the quality
of one’s truesoul, the path of cultivation was an incredibly
dangerous one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one was killed and
one’s soul was shattered, everything would be oever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He failed numerous
times. He was reincarnated a total of nine times,” Subhuti said.
“Of his nine reincarnations, six of them were as ordinary mortals
who didn’t even embark on the patho f cultivation. Thus, upon dying
he was naturally sent to be reincarnated once more. In two other
lives, he died at the Zifu level and was once more sent to be
reincarnated. Finally, during his ninth life, he was reborn as a
member of the primordial human clan…Laozi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this life, he was an
absolutely dazzling figure. He advanced at an absolutely breakneck
pace, and because his memories of his past life were unable to
disturb him, he was able to train all the way to become a Daofather
through mastering the Heavenly Dao of Yin. Only then did were his
former memories awakened…and both the Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang
were now under his control. His power instantly exploded!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He then devised the
Three Pure Ones technique, becoming so powerful that even Mother Nuwa
might not have been a match for him at that point in time. He
essentially became the number one leader of the entire Primordial
Era. Because Yuanshi had devised the Three Pure Ones technique, he
gave himself the title ‘Daoist Three Purities’. He then
established the Daoist Path, passing down many Daoist techniques and
becoming the leader of the Daoist Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned by
what he heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because his memories
were masked during the reincarnation process, he was able to gain
insights into a complimentary Heavenly Dao without being impacted by
his original Heavenly Dao. But this was a gamble. If his soul was
shattered, he would have truly perished.” Subhuti sighed. “Because
of Daoist Three Purities, there were a total of six Daofathers who
also committed suicide after setting down seals upon their
truesouls.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…there has
never been any word of them since. From the Primordial Era to the
modern day, there has never been any traces of them,” Subhuti said.
“Perhaps they have died…or perhaps they are continuing to pass
through the endless cycle of reincarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nonstop reincarnation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those Daofathers who
committed suicide all had extraordinary truesouls; their talent had
to be extraordinary as well. As long as they had a chance to embark
on the Immortal path, they undoubtedly would…but the Immortal path
was an extremely deadly one. One might be slain by an enemy,
resulting in one’s soul being shattered and dispersed! An extremely
long period of time had passed since the Primordial Era. Those six
Daofathers were most likely long deceased, their souls having entered
the endless River of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the six of
them disappeared, a very long period of time passed with no other
major powers deciding to reincarnate themselves. However…all the
major powers had hearts that were focused on the Dao, and all of them
wished to grow more powerful.” Subhuti sighed. “And so, Buddha
Tathagata, then an ordinary figure amongst major powers, sent himself
into the paths of reincarnation, killing himself and being
reincarnated anew. Back then, Tathagata had already mastered four of
the Heavenly Daos of the Five Elements. All he needed to do was
master the Heavenly Dao of Earth, but he could not; whenever he
tried, the other four Heavenly Daos would disturb him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A crazy man can get
crazy results.” Subhuti shook his head and sighed. “On
Tathagata’s third reincarnation, he became the prince of a small
human kingdom. His name was Sakyamuni. He was naturally a brilliant,
dazzling figure…and in the end, he mastered the Heavenly Dao of
Earth and became a Daofather. His former memories were awakened, and
the Buddhists, previously just one of many organizations within
Pangu’s World, instantly skyrocketed in power. Tathagata thus
became the leader of the Buddhist Sangha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have now heard
the tales of how the leaders of the Daoist Path and the Buddhist
Sangha rose to power. What do you think?” Subhuti looked towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible
determination. Incredible willpower.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two had already
been Daofathers to begin with. They could live eternal, careless
lives of freedom…but both of them had hearts that were extremely
focused upon the Dao. For the sake of gaining a higher level of
enlightenment, they were willing to wager their eternal lives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had won their
bets…but many other Daofathers had lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To train in the Dao to
a higher level…it was far, far too difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, the
Primordial Era was an era of nonstop war,” Subhuti said. “The
most powerful actors were the kingdoms that were controlled by a few
of the Elder Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once, a war erupted
between the kingdoms led by the Elder God of Water, Gonggong, and the
Elder God of Fire, Zhurong. These two Elder Gods began to battle with
reckless abandon atop Pangu’s World. Gonggong, seeing that his
forces were about to be defeated, went completely berserk. The crazed
Gongong, in his madness and fury, actually rammed against and
shattered Mount Buzhou, which Pangu had used as a pillar to hold up
the heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a result…the
heavens themselves were shattered. The very foundation of Pangu’s
World was in danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven and Earth
began to tremble, as though the end times had come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both Gonggong and
Zhurong panicked. All the major powers of the Primordial Era gathered
together, wanting to stop the destruction of the world, but none of
them had any solutions. In the end, it was Mother Nuwa who saved us.
At such a critical moment, she actually made yet another a
breakthrough, resulting in her gaining complete mastery over the
Heavenly Daos of the Five Elements. She gathered together the essence
of the Five Elements from Heaven and Earth, then created a divine
five-colored stone which she used to repair the hole in the skies.
Only after she did so did Heaven and Earth slowly return to normal.
Since she was now a master of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements, she
became the indisputably most powerful figure of the Primordial Era.
Because Nuwa healed the heavens and saved the world, everyone in the
Primordial Era would respectfully refer to her as ‘Mother’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother Nuwa was
extremely close to Elder God Fuxi, who was like a brother to her. He
disliked battle, but he saw Mother Nuwa making constant breakthroughs
while his own power barely budged. As a result…he committed suicide
and threw himself into the cycle of reincarnation. He sealed away his
memories, which would only be awakened once he mastered the Heavenly
Dao of Life.” Subhuti shook his head. “He was reborn as a human,
and he became one of the Three Emperors of Mankind of the Primordial
Era, Fuxi. But to this very day, he has yet to awaken his former
memories.”

Chapter 3 - The Secret History Of The Three Realms (3)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Fuxi was
reincarnated as a human, he ended up mastering the Heavenly Daos of
Yin and Yang, gaining inconceivable amounts of insight into the art
of formations. To this very day, he remains the most skilled
formations expert of the entire Three Realms,” Subhuti said.
“However…although his power has reached an incomparably
frightening level, he’s never been able to regain his memories,
because he still has yet to comprehend the Heavenly Dao of Life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning let out a sigh.
The man had already mastered two Heavenly Daos, but he still wasn’t
able to awaken his memories? The will of Heaven truly did toy with
men and Immortals alike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth…since, he
was once an Elder God with an incomparably powerful body, his current
level of power is most likely roughly on par with his former level of
power as an Elder God.” Subhuti said. “This reincarnation…I
don’t know if it was a good thing for Fuxi or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In any event, the
Primordial Era persisted for a very long period of time. Some focused
on the Dao, while others focused on warfare and killing. The human
race rose to sudden prominence, then began to face one war after
another. Many major powers died, and even more Empyrean Gods died.”
Subhuti shook his head and sighed, a look of sadness and pity in his
eyes. “Because of ambition…multiple Elder Gods died as well. Even
the most powerful force of the Primordial Era, the dragon race, fell
into darkness due to the death of the Ancestor Dragon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancestor Dragon
is dead?” Ning cried out in shock. The Ancestor Dragon was one of
the ten great Elder Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From what his master
was saying, Elder Gods all had incomparably mighty bodies and were
similar to the Human Emperors and the leaders of Buddhism and Daoism
in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just the
Ancestor Dragon. The Elder God of Metal, Rushou, was killed in battle
as well!” Subhuti shook his head. “That’s the nature of war…and
when there are no outside threats, internal wars will become
particularly vicious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Internal wars?”
Ning was startled. “Master, are you saying…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Internal wars?”
The nearby Empyrean God Redsnow, who had been listening quietly this
entire time, was startled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the many battles
that went on during this period of time were ‘internal wars’,
then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the
Primordial Era, when Shennong wandered the primordial chaos in search
of precious materials, he ended up discovering an alien lifeform
within it,” Subhuti said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alien lifeform?”
Ning and Redsnow were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The primordial chaos
is vast and infinite. You must understand that all the Elder Gods
themselves were born from it…which means that it naturally is
capable of giving birth to other creatures as well.” Subhuti let
out a sigh. “The alien accidentally discovered us…but
fortunately, Shennong discovered it as well and ensured it wouldn’t
be able to infiltrate us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alien was
incomparably vicious and frenzied in its assaults. It immediately
launched a war against our primordial world,” Subhuti said. “I
imagine both of you have heard of this alien’s name before. His
name…was Rahu! He was the first Outsider who came to us from the
primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first?” Ning
and Redsnow instantly understood. Most likely, more Outsiders had
come from the primordial chaos as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu was absolutely
berserk. He boasted to us, ‘I, Rahu, have roamed the primordial
chaos for eons. Do you think I will fear the puny denizens of a
backwaters chaosworld?’” Subhuti shook his head. “We instantly
understood that there had to be other powerful creatures living
within the primordial chaos as well. Rahu was just one of them. Rahu
didn’t really get a full picture of our world’s power before
launching a war against us. Thus, even though he was completely
berserk, he was still defeated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then…with but
the wave of his hand, Rahu was able to manifest a vast, massive
army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He himself was a bit
more powerful than even the likes of the Human Emperors or the
Buddhist and Daoist leaders. Only Mother Nuwa was a match for him!
However, we managed to win through sheer numbers, grinding him down
and killing him,” Subhuti said. “After Rahu died, we used his
shattered body as ingredients for forging many treasures. Your Rahu
Bow, Ji Ning, was one of those treasures. Although most of them were
initially just top-grade Pure Yang treasures when first created, more
than 90% have evolved to become Protocosmic spirit-treasures by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu’s arrival
caused the entire primordial world to be shocked into wakefulness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We thought to
ourselves, ‘So, aside from us…there actually are other living
creatures within the primordial chaos as well, some of whom possess
tremendous power.’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…the
Primordial Era began to stabilize. The many frenzied wars began to
come to an end, and in fact we began to feel regret for what we did.
So many major powers had been killed in our internal wars, all for
the sake of foolish ambition. Because the human race had their three
Emperors of Mankind, and because the various other races no longer
wished to engage in internal squabbling…mankind ended up becoming
the leader of the races.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time flowed on, and
countless eras went by.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…yet
another storm arrived.” Subhuti said solemnly, “Countless major
powers, including both Mother Nuwa and myself, sensed an incomparably
powerful force drawing close to our primordial world. Thus…we went
into the primordial chaos, moving towards that force to investigate
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After travelling
through the primordial chaos for more than half a month…we finally
discovered what that force was!” A hint of grief and pain could be
seen in Subhuti’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow both
continued to listen carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was an absolutely
massive, ellipsoid world…a chaosworld that was almost the same as
our Pangu’s World!” Subhuti said heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chaosworld, just
like Pangu’s World?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow both
called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at the
two of them. “Since Pangu was able to cleave apart the primordial
chaos to establish Heaven and Earth in creating his Pangu’s
World…why wouldn’t there be others within the infinite primordial
chaos that could do the same?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow were
instantly rendered speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That other world
also had its Elder Gods! However, in order to differentiate them from
us, we referred to them as Fiends. We called them Elder Fiends, True
Fiends, and Empyrean Fiends!” Subhuti said heavily, “As for that
world itself..we referred to it as the Seamless Chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless
Chaosworld?” Both Ning and Redsnow were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seamless?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seamless Gate?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The modern
‘Seamless Gate’ originated from the Seamless Chaosworld.”
Subhuti nodded. “The Seamless Chaosworld and our Pangu’s
Chaosworld…these two chaosworlds were continuing to move through
the primordial chaos, drawing closer and closer to each other. There
would come a day in which the two chaosworlds would smash into each
other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In fact, as our two
worlds drew closer…the major powers of both sides could
subconsciously sense that the hands of fate were working to fuse the
two worlds together into a single, massive chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless
Chaosworld was different from our world,” Subhuti said. “In our
Pangu’s Chaosworld…because Mother Nuwa was a transcendent figure
who rarely got involved in worldly matters, we ended up having many
internal wars and many casualties. The most powerful member of the
Seamless Chaosworld, however, was the Elder Fiend of the Heart,
Demonheart. This demon possessed tremendous ambition, and he had long
ago taken over the entire Seamless Chaosworld with his unmatchable
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, they had
five Elder Fiends of Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, and Heart! They also
had two other Daofather-level figures who were as powerful as the
likes of Daoist Three Purities! Patriarch Demonheart in particular…he
was very close to Pangu’s level of power. Not even Mother Nuwa was
a match for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our side had
suffered heavy losses due to our years of internal struggles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually had
even more True Gods than us. Too many of ours had died in our
internal wars.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth, they were
more powerful than us! Given Patriarch Demonheart’s ambitions…he
naturally wanted to take control over the fused chaosworld, but those
of us from Pangu’s Chaosworld naturally wouldn’t agree! And
so…war began!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangu’s Chaosworld
against the Seamless Chaosworld…a war that shattered the heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, right at
this critical moment, a terrifying figure appeared…the Lord of All
Things!” Subhuti was deathly serious now. “The Lord of All Things
was and remains the most terrifyingly powerful Outsider from the
primordial chaos that Pangu’s Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld have ever encountered. In fact, the reason why our two
chaosworlds were slowly moving closer to each other was because of
his secret machinations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow felt
their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After both
chaosworlds had suffered tremendous casualties during the war…the
grand army of the Lord of All Things appeared.” Subhuti continued,
“The reason why he was known as the ‘Lord of All Things’ was
precisely because he had reached an unfathomable level of expertise
in making use of the various materials of the universe. In fact, the
entire Dao of Constructs originally stemmed from him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Lord of All
Things had an enormous number of golems under his command, many of
which were at the Daofather level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, he also
had a large number of Queen Mothers under his command. These were the
same as the creatures you encountered within the Nihilum Zone,
capable of giving birth to countless powerful soldiers. When all of
the soldiers joined together into armies, each of them had the combat
power of a Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His personal power,
however, was actually just on par with the likes of Daoist Three
Purities or Tathagata. However, the Lord of All Things had even
altered his own body. It was quite unique, because it was simply
unbreakable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sudden arrival
of the Lord of All Things, along with his grand army that was
comparable to the total power of either chaosworld…it was a
calamity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, right at
that critical moment, Mother Nuwa made her breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A qualitative
breakthrough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She broke through to
Pangu’s level, and she instantly began to massacre our enemies. The
Lord of All Things was slain, while Patriarch Demonheart was forced
to hide by merging his body into the Heavenly Daos. The Seamless Gate
had already suffered enormous casualties during the war, and the
survivors were absolutely butchered by Mother Nuwa. The only one who
managed to escape from her hands was Patriarch Windfiend, who was
second in power only to Patriarch Demonheart. He even managed to
rescue many of the major powers of the Seamless Gate as well.
Fortunately, the first person Mother Nuwa acted against was Patriarch
Demonheart; otherwise, Patriarch Windfiend probably would’ve been
able to rescue him and save him as well. His fleeing abilities truly
were incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch
Windfiend?” Ning and Redsnow both memorized this name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who could flee
from Mother Nuwa and save so many other major powers as well was
worth of them memorizing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Windfiend
is now respectfully referred to by the Seamless Gate as the Lord of
All Fiends. His power is truly unfathomable!” Subhuti exclaimed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That apocalyptic
war…it caused the two chaosworlds that were about to fuse together
to instead completely shatter apart. The largest remnant piece is now
known as the ‘Primordial Ruinworld’, while the other pieces
became the Celestial Realm, the Netherworld Kingdom, the three
thousand major worlds, and the trillion minor worlds,” Subhuti
said. “As for the soldiers and the army left behind by the
Outsider, the Lord of All Things…some of them were slain by Mother
Nuwa, but most of them ended up being driven into the Primordial
Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The remnants of his
army didn’t pose a major threat to us. Rather than get rid of them,
we left them there as a warning and a reminder,” Subhuti said
solemnly. “We were to never forget that the primordial chaos still
contains other living creatures. We simply can’t afford to engage
in internal wars of attrition any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
were formed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later on, for an
extremely urgent reason, Mother Nuwa left us and entered the
primordial chaos, never to return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Mother Nuwa
left…Patriarch Windfiend came back, bringing the many major powers
of the Seamless Chaosworld with him.” Subhuti shook his head. “He
was simply too difficult to deal with, and his forces weren’t weak.
Since we were worried about the threat which Outsiders posed, and
since Patriarch Windfiend wasn’t confident that he could defeat
us…our two sides came to an accord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since then, we
have had no further quarrels with the Seamless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
living creatures within the Three Realms which have the blood of gods
in them, while others have the blood of fiends within them. In truth,
since both our world and the Seamless world were both chaosworlds,
there wasn’t that much of a difference between us. Thus, we simply
referred to these creatures as ‘Fiendgods’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for those who
were born from Primordial Chaos? They were jointly referred to as
Fiendgods of Primordial Chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strictly speaking,
though…those of us from Pangu’s World should be referred to as
Empyrean Gods and True Gods of Primordial Chaos, while those of the
Seamless Gate should be referred to as Empyrean Fiends and True
Fiends of Primordial Chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti continued,
“Countless years passed. The Three Realms gave birth to many more
major powers, and the Three Realms once more began to flourish and
grow. However…not too long ago, all the major powers began to
subconsciously sense that an unavoidable war was going to erupt
between our side and the Seamless side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All major powers
possess fairly formidable subconscious senses towards fate, as you
know. We could sense that if we tried to avoid the war…the result
would be death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow now
completely understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So the Seamless Gate
had originated from a separate chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The whispers of fate
and destiny are never wrong.” Subhuti shook his head. “Although
all of us have many suspicions…we can clearly sense that the Nuwa
Alliance will only be able to survive if we annihilate the Seamless
Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
couldn’t but interject, “The Nuwa Alliance belongs to Pangu’s
Chaosworld, while the Seamless Alliance comes from a separate one.
Why, then, are people like Old Man Yuan hesitant?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suhbuti said coldly,
“They are a pack of fools! Both of our sides have shared the Three
Realms for countless years now, and many of the major powers on both
sides have become very close friends with each other. There are
countless ‘Fiendgods’ amongst the many races. In truth, both
sides all but merged together long ago…and so Old Man Yuan and his
ilk still wish for both sides to peacefully coexist. They view the
Seamless as being brothers and are unwilling to become enemies to
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the whispers of
fate definitely can’t be wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am absolutely
certain that we can only survive if we wipe out the Seamless Gate. In
turn, the Seamless Gate is also absolutely certain that they can only
survive if they wipe us out. Although there are many things we do not
understand with regards to this great tribulation…fate always
points and guides us towards the correct path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at the
two men before him. “Ji Ning. Redsnow. The two of you are still
weak; you need to continue training for now. After all…even if we
manage to survive this storm, it’s very possible than yet another
Outsider like the Lord of All Things will appear, causing yet another
tribulation to descend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Both
Ning and Redsnow were very solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outsiders from the
primordial chaos?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Other chaosworlds?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why had Mother Nuwa
entered the primordial chaos, never to return?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These questions caused
Ning and Redsnow to understand that in the past, they had been like
frogs within a well, unable to see the greater world outside. In
truth…the heavens were far vaster than they had imagined them to
be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having concluded his
tale of the secret history of the Three Realms, Subhuti let out a
smile. “Right. Ji Ning, I understand you have a daughter with you.
Show her to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” When
Ning thought of his daughter, his heart instantly turned warm. He
immediately willed for his daughter Brightmoon to emerge from the
world of the Violetdawn Pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The barefoot Brightmoon
nibbled on her fingers as she curiously stared at her surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.”
Brightmoon instantly wrapped her arms around Ning’s thigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon, come
here. Kowtow and show your respects to the Old Patriarch,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon’s eyes
instantly turned huge. She stared carefully at the ruddy-faced,
white-bearded old man, then obediently fell to her knees and
kowtowed. “Brightmoon greets you, Old Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Subhuti
was greatly pleased by what he saw. Laughing, he said, “Your father
is my disciple, and so you can be considered a member of Mount
Innerheart as well. Thus, I shall transmit Fiendgod Body Refining
techniques and Ki Refining techniques to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pointed towards her.
Swish! Instantly, a streak of light flew straight into Brightmoon’s
forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master!”
Ning was overjoyed. At present, there were very few things capable of
making Ning happy, and the person he cared most about was this
precious daughter of his. Mount Innerheart’s rules were very
strict, so Ning didn’t dare to casually teach her any of the
techniques he had learned here, but the other techniques he had
weren’t particularly elite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If your daughter can
overcome her tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal or Empyrean
God, I’ll give her another give. Alright, you can leave now.”
Subhuti waved his arm. “Redsnow, you stay for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Both Ning
and Redsnow assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately picked
up his daughter, who had fallen into a dazed, sleep-like state.
Subhuti had transmitted a veritable ocean of techniques to her, and
there was a limit to how much she could process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the following days,
they remained at Mount Innerheart. Ning lived a peaceful life here,
along with his daughter. Only when he was with his daughter would the
pain in his heart be slightly alleviated. Slowly, Ning’s heart grew
calmer and calmer. He was quietly preparing, because he could sense
that the day of his tribulation was drawing closer and closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.”
Brightmoon came running towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon.” Ning
smiled at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, I heard you
are about to undergo your Empyrean Tribulation?” Brightmoon raised
her head to look at the nearby Uncle White. “Grandpa White, my
father is going to undergo his Empyrean Tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who told you?!”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in Mount
Innerheart knows about it,” Brightmoon immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow disciples
really are blabbermouths.” Ning shook his head helplessly, then
looked at Brightmoon and nodded. “Yes. Tomorrow, I shall undergo
the Empyrean Tribulation.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 - Empyrean God Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the
Empyrean Tribulation is very dangerous.” Brightmoon was very
worried. Her two hands were clenched tightly in front of her chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning bent downwards,
gently taking his daughter into his arms. He looked at her face, then
smiled. “Brightmoon, don’t worry. The Empyrean Tribulation might
be dangerous to others, but to me, your father…it’s really
nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really?”
Brightmoon hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really. You have to
trust Father,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Brightmoon reached out with her little hands to hug Ning’s head.
“Father, Mother’s gone. I don’t want you to leave me too.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his heart
ache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon was still
very young. Yu Wei’s death had an enormous impact on her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father will never,
ever leave you, Brightmoon.” Ning held his daughter in his arms,
then whispered to her, “Father will always protect you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s
promise to his daughter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night, Brightmoon
slept by Ning’s side. She was afraid that Ning was going to leave
her and go take on the Empyrean Tribulation by himself, and she
insisted on personally watching him undergo it. Only then would she
feel at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to get up.”
Ning tweaked his slumbering daughter’s little nose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ungh…”
Brightmoon struggled to opeher eyes, then gazed blankly at her
surroundings for a moment. Clearly, she hadn’t fully woken up yet,
but upon seeing Ning she couldn’t help but reach out to hug him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to get up. It’s
already bright outside.” Ning gave his daughter a little kiss on
the face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Brightmoon
rubbed her eyes, then sat up and looked towards the outside. It was
early dawn right now, and the skies were slowly brightening. “Ah?!
Father, you are going to undergo your Empyrean Tribulation today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…so hurry up
and get up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
and Little Qing had been waiting here for some time now. Upon hearing
the playful voices coming from within the room, they couldn’t help
but reveal smiles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These days, Master
only ever laughs when he’s with little Brightmoon,” Little Qing
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s redirected
all the love he felt towards Yu Wei and his parents to that little
girl.” The Whitewater Hound let out a sigh. “Fortunately, Yu Wei
gave birth before it all happened. Otherwise…I really can’t
imagine what my son Ning would be like right now, after suffering
such heavy blows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaaak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the room
swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome, slender
white-robed youth walked out, leading an adorable little girl by the
hand. The handsome youth looked young, but his calm, sea-deep eyes
seemed to hold infinity within them. Everyone understood that he was
no longer young. His heart, in particularly…would no longer be
young again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Uncle
White and Little Qing followed behind Ning. Right after they emerged
from the courtyard, they saw Bluecliff Xiaoyu waiting outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Xiaoyu
called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holding his daughter
Brightmoon’s hand, Ning led Uncle White, Little Qing, and Xiaoyu
out of Mount Innerheart. He then used a spatial teleportation to
arrive at a vast, desolate area within the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large group of people
had already gathered in this location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow and the rest of
the seven Empyrean Gods, Silvermoon, Lord Jiang, Crazy Ji, and the
others had all arrived. They had even brought their disciples and
grand-disciples with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After landing, Ning
waved his hand. Autumn Leaf, Mu Northson, and several others suddenly
appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you have to be careful. Although the Empyrean
Tribulation won’t be too hard for you, it’s still good to be
careful,” Crazy Ji instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry at
all, second apprentice-brother.” Ning nodded, then walked by
himself to a nearby location. He only took three steps, but moved a
total of three thousand meters away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then…he just silently
stood there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] energy had been forcibly barred at the
seventeenth stage for a long time now. It was ready to break through
at any moment…and now, it broke through the final bottleneck to
enter the eighteenth stage! At the same time, Ning’s true body also
broke through to the peak of the Void level as a Ki Refiner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he simultaneously
broke through in both aspects, the Heavenly Daos immediately began to
activate and take effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…a
wind began to arise around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His tribulation has
started.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master really is
quite straightforward. As soon as he arrived, he immediately
initiated his tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother is formidable and has experienced extraordinary
things. His Empyrean Tribulation will most likely be similarly
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crowd watched from
far away with nervousness, especially Brightmoon. Her two little
hands were so tightly clenched that her nails were white. She chewed
on her lips as she stared at Ning. She was afraid…afraid that her
father would disappear as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, in the
distant wilderness, stood an old man and a woodcutter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody was able to
detect their presence. Not even Crazy Ji noticed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me…do you
think your junior apprentice-brother will succeed?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Empyrean
Tribulation? No question about it. The only question in my mind is,
during his nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation, will the ‘Pure
Yang Goldlight Thunder’ appear?” The woodcutter chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang Goldlight
Thunder? Hrm…it has indeed been a long, long time since it last
appeared. From the Primordial Era to the modern day, the number of
times it has appeared has been pitifully low. If it does
appear…although it will pose a major threat, it’ll also allow
your junior apprentice-brother to possess an even more perfect
Empyrean God body,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind. Fire. Thunder.
These three tribulations served to temper the body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refiners generally
would gain a Celestial Immortal body when they succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Fiendgod Body
Refiners, their Empyrean Tribulations would generally be much more
powerful than the ones the Ki Refiners faced. When they succeeded,
however, they would gain the body of an Empyrean God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful the
Empyrean Tribulation, the more perfect an Empyrean God body one would
possess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power amongst Empyrean Gods as well, after all. For some weak
Empyrean Gods, countless eons would needed for their bodies to train
to the peak of power. The quality of an Empyrean God body was one of
the factors that determined if one would be able to become a True God
or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wild wind began to
howl as countless wind-blades swirled together into an enormous
vortex, with Ji Ning standing at the very heart of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind tribulation
alone is even more terrifying than the nine nine-sets of thunder
tribulation which his Primaltwin endured.” The distant viewers had
strange looks on their faces. The power of this wind was simply too
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even for Ning, his Ki
Refiner techniques were useless right now. He was completely relying
on the Sixth Cycle of his [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stood there in the
the center of the wind vortex, staring at the skies in a very calm
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final burst of
invisible Empyrean God Wind arrived, entering through his head and
spreading out throughout his body, causing every single part of it to
shudder. His heart, however, was as calm as water. He wasn’t moved
even slightly. While shuddering and trembling, Ning’s divine body
began to soundlessly evolve. This evolution wasn’t particularly
noteworthy, however; only when the thunder tribulation ended would
his body truly undergo a qualitative change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind tribulation
is over.” Ning raised his head to look at the sky as he murmured
softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
scorchingly hot cloud had appeared in the air above him. This
spinning cloud was covered with a layer of golden flame that was
visible to the naked eye. As the cloud descended, the temperature in
the surrounding area began to drastically rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate.” The
distant Crazy Ji immediately waved the ragged fan he was holding, and
a blurry azure light arose to surround the spectators, protecting all
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything in the
wilderness around Ning, however, was instantly charred. In fact,
everything began to transform into dust as the cloud of fire
continued to descend. The ground itself began to disappear beneath
Ning, who simply stood there in the air, staring at the cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…the flames
descended upon Ning, who still didn’t do anything to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All tribulations
started weak and grew progressively more powerful; the same was true
for the fire tribulation. If the Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] was unable to endure the tribulation, Ning would then
move to fight back. The fire tribulation, however…Ning felt
confident that it wasn’t capable of forcing him to defend himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flames blazed about
him, quickly reaching to the truefire level. One type of truefire
after another appeared, including even Solar Truefire. But Ning
simply continued to stand there, not caring at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the cloud of
fire dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly seemed to
transform into a burning man as a fiery light suddenly engulfed his
entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Brightmoon,
watching from far away, was so terrified that her face turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. This is
Empyrean God Fire. There’s no way to block it; all you can do is
endure it. Although it’s far, far more powerful than Celestial
Immortal Fire,” the nearby Little Qing explained, “Your father’s
Dao-heart is formidable. He isn’t afraid of this fire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, Ning quickly
returned to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. Soon,
the skies themselves began to gather power within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow,
Silvermoon, and the other distant spectators all turned solemn. The
wind tribulation and fire tribulation had been extremely easy for
Ning. Given that his heartforce had reached the fourth stage, even
the demonheart tribulation would most likely be quite easy. Fourth
stage heartforce made him an incredible figure of the Three Realms;
there was no way he would succumb to the demonheart tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only potential
threat to him was actually the thunder tribulation…which would also
serve as the most important part of the tempering of his Empyrean God
body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how
powerful the first bolt of junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s nine
nine-sets will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all watched
nervously. It was absolutely guaranteed that Ji Ning would undergo
the full nine nine-sets. The more powerful the first thunderbolt was,
the more terrifying the final, eighty-first thunderbolt would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sky went dark!”
Brightmoon suddenly called out nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone, Ji Ning
included, raised their heads to stare at the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire sky had
turned pitch-black, as far as the naked eye could see. The seemingly
infinitely large stormclouds had covered this entire region, and
their overwhelming power was simply shocking to behold. As for
Ning…he still just stared calmly towards the skies. Now, however, a
pair of divine swords had appeared within his hands.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Empyrean_God_Ji_Ning"></A>
Chapter 5 - Empyrean God Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a shocking
aura!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji twirled his
fan, narrowing his eyes. Empyrean God Redsnow just watched solemnly.
All of them were extremely experienced and had seen many things; they
knew very well that normally, the clouds of the thunder tribulation
would consist of two dark clouds that would draw close to each other
and merge together. This was true even for most nine nine-sets of
thunder tribulation. Only when the thunder tribulation underwent a
qualitative change would something like this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast heavens were
filled with a tribulation cloud of seemingly infinite size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very center of
the infinite tribulation cloud, countless streaks of violet light
could be seen dancing about. The violet light began to swirl about
and gather in number until they filled nearly the entire cloud. By
now, one could see violet streaks of light stretching off as far as
the naked eye could see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, a storm
whirlpool began to form in the air above Ji Ning. The whirlpool began
to spin in a very sluggish, arduous manner, but as it spun, it
continuously drew in and devoured the violet light around it. Even
the tribulation cloud itself was being sucked into this maelstrom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The edges
of the tribulation cloud could now be seen. It continued to shrink
and flow into the maelstrom, as did the endless streaks of violet
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the center of
the maelstrom was a region of utter chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the only thing left in the skies was this terrifying chaos maelstrom.
The tribulation cloud had completely vanished. Not even any hint of
its former aura of might had been left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I feel so
nervous right now…” Mu Northson mumbled softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never seen
any records regarding a thunder tribulation like this in any of the
books of Mount Innerheart.” Little Qing was worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bolts of lightning
began to materialize within the chaos maelstrom. These lightning
bolts were almost completely violet, with a few streaks of white
mixed into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-white
thunderbolt came crashing down from the vortex in the skies. It
didn’t possess a savage, dominating aura; instead, it possessed a
terrifying aura of imperial majesty, making viewers feel as though it
was an emperor that they had to bow their heads before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned
slightly. “When my Primaltwin underwent its tribulation, this sort
of beautiful, violet-white thunderbolt only appeared starting from
the seventy-third bolt. I didn’t expect that the very first bolt my
true body would encounter would be on this level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a feeling that
this thunder tribulation of his wouldn’t be so easily overcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
in midair, allowing the thunderbolt to crash upon his body and
allowing sparks of electricity to dance across him. A divine body on
the level of a Pure Yang treasure wouldn’t be easily damaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One thunderbolt after
another came crashing downwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
thunderbolts continued to rise. By the ninth bolt, the thunderbolts
had turned completely white, a dazzling, pure, sacred white that
contained an ineffable nobility and majesty to it. The white bolts
crashed down upon Ning’s white-robed body, but Ning simply stood
there, head raised as he watched them slam down towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The thunder
tribulation’s not that bad.” The distant Brightmoon watched as
her white-clothed father was bathed in the radiance of the white
thunderbolts. A look of veneration was in her eyes as she said
excitedly, “Father hasn’t even done anything, but he’s still
able to easily endure them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Brightmoon,
the fact that your father is easily able to resist these thunderbolts
doesn’t mean that his thunder tribulation isn’t a terrifying one.
Before you were born, your father’s Primaltwin underwent the
Celestial Tribulation. When that happened, only the very final
thunderbolt of his nine nine-sets was this dazzling white color.”
The nearby Uncle White explained, “Your father has trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and has a formidable divine body, which is
why he can take it head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] is that powerful?” Brightmoon’s eyes sparkled. “I
want to learn it too!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bolts of lightning
continued to crash downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The noble, dazzling
white color began to be intermixed with streaks of gold, causing the
thunderbolts to have an aura of supremacy and exaltedness. It was as
though Ning was facing the Dao of the Heavens itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the thunderbolts
crashed down upon him, bathing him in electricity, Ning felt as
though he was being washed in water. His entire divine body felt
quite comfortable, and it was slowly beginning to change in very
minor ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-sixth
bolt…the forty-ninth bolt…the fifty-fourth bolt…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
thunderbolts continued to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sixth Cycle of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] truly is incredible.” Empyrean God
Redsnow sighed softly. “All those years ago, when I faced the final
thunderbolt of my Empyrean Tribulation, I had to go all-out in order
to survive it…but it was only as powerful as this fifty-fourth
thunderbolt of Ji Ning’s. But Ji Ning hasn’t even been forced to
fight back; his divine body is completely capable of enduring this
level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Redsnow, you were born when Heaven and Earth had
first been established. Back then, the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] didn’t
even exist,” Crazy Ji said with a laugh. “From the looks of
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s thunder tribulation…there is
a high chance that the Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder will appear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang Goldlight
Thunder?” Empyrean God Redsnow grew slightly worried. “If that’s
the case…I’m afraid that the Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] won’t be able to withstand it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji lightly
twirled his fan. Chuckling, he said, “Just watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bathed in electricity,
Ning could clearly sense the power of the thunder tribulation
continuing to grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventy-second
bolt. The seventy-third bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning bolts had
turned almost completely golden, with just a little bit of white
remaining within them. The power of the thunderbolts was so great
that Ning’s body was beginning to shudder. Tiny wounds had begun to
appear across his body, but his divine power automatically and
instantly healed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re actually
striking me so hard that my divine body is almost unable to endure it
any longer.” Ning still just stared at the skies, allowing the
thunderbolts to come crashing down as he watched them carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventy-eighth
bolt. The seventh-ninth bolt. The eightieth bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” The
white-robed Ning’s body momentarily blurred as he assumed the
[Three Heads, Six Arms] form. Six of the Ananda World-Swords appeared
within his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!” The six
Ananda World-Swords in his hands, Ning charged upwards towards the
skies, charging straight towards the chaos maelstrom within them. A
streak of completely pure gold had appeared within the chaos
maelstrom as well. This lightning bolt didn’t have any other colors
within it whatsoever. The pure gold thunderbolt carried a supremely
Yang, supremely aggressive aura, and supremely sharp aura. Just
looking at it would make one’s heart shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying.”
Brightmoon’s heart trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang Goldlight
Thunder!” Redsnow was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang Goldlight
Thunder.” Crazy Ji finally stopped fanning himself as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti and
the woodcutter watched from afar as this happened. Pure Yang
Goldlight Thunder…it would only appear during these tribulations.
Normally, there was no way for Immortals or Fiendgods to train to a
level where they could manifest this Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder. The
power of this thunderbolt was too shockingly great, and it contained
boundless mysteries within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, using [Three
Heads, Six Arms] and his six Ananda World-Swords, charged straight
against the heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supremely Yang and
supremely aggressive Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder came smashing down
towards him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRASH!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six dazzling streaks of
sword-light lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single streak of
sword-light was filled with Ning’s powerful heartforce. His fourth
level heartforce had been completely poured into his swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
BOOM BOOM! The six powerful streaks of sword-light smashed head-on
against the thunderbolt. The bolt of Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder was
completely blasted apart with a violet explosion, but shattered bits
of golden electricity still came crashing down upon Ning’s body.
However, they were only enough to cause Ning’s divine body to
tremble slightly. They were unable to leave behind any actual wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The chaos
maelstrom in the skies rapidly began to shrink, condensing into a
final streak of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The streak of lightning
landed upon Ning’s body, having moved so incredibly fast that there
was no way to block it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…pop…rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense all of
his bones crackling and popping. Thanks to this profound, arcane
streak of lightning, his body was quickly changing and transforming,
becoming even tougher and even more powerful. At the same time, his
internal organs and his muscles were rumbling as they transformed as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends…if one endures the Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder, then after
one becomes an Empyrean God, one will have a perfect divine body.”
Ning understood what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If an Empyrean God
wished to break through to become a True God, a prerequisite was that
the Empyrean God’s body had to first be perfected. A perfect divine
body meant that in terms of speed, divine power, or physical
strength, one had to reach the utter peak of power possible for
Empyrean Gods. If there was no Pure Yang Goldlight Thunder, he would
have to slowly train for an extremely, extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position within the desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demonheart
tribulation had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The demonheart
tribulation is of no threat to Ji Ning.” Patriarch Subhuti smiled
merrily towards his distant disciple, then nodded and said, “We can
consider his Empyrean Tribulation to have been a success.”
Patriarch Subhuti then vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woodcutter nodded
slightly as well. In a soft voice, he said, “I wonder if this
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning of mine will be able to break
through to become a True God or Daofather before the final Endwar.”
And then, the woodcutter vanished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the two vanished,
the only one of the spectators who seemed to vaguely sense something
was Crazy Ji. Crazy Ji turned his head, scanning behind him with a
frown on his face. “What did I just sense? Was that Master and
eldest apprentice-brother?” In all of Mount Innerheart, the only
ones who were capable of acting in such mysterious, inscrutable ways
were his master and the eldest apprentice-brother, the most
formidable figure amongst all of the disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heartforce was
far too powerful. Although the demonheart tribulation that descended
upon him was extremely terrifying, Ning’s heartforce was able to
easily resist it. Ning only had to spend roughly a month within the
demonheart world before he completely awakened from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve always known
that she would be the shadow cast over my heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I even tried to
force myself to believe that she really was my senior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…I could still
sense, no matter how hard I tried, that it was nothing more than a
lie. An illusion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position. He slowly opened his eyes, filled with unshed tears.
However, his tears quickly dissipated and vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce had
reached the fourth stage. It was far, far too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had wanted to spend
some extra time with ‘Yu Wei’ in the world of the demonheart
tribulation, but alas…he found out, to his agony, that his
heartforce was so powerful that he couldn’t help but see through
all of the lies. The Yu Wei of the demonheart world was fake. An
illusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, Ning
understood that if his heartforce had only been at the third level,
he might been completely unable to tell that the Yu Wei of the
demonheart world was an illusion…and that he might’ve truly,
forever become trapped within that world, never to escape again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing more than
foolish hopes and dreams…” Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heaven and Earth seemed
to change in color as beautiful, auspicious clouds of light filled
the skies and golden lotuses filled the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enormous copies of the
Solar Star and Lunar Star appeared in the air above Ning. An utterly
torrid flow of power from the Solar Star and Lunar Star was
transmitted directly into Ning’s body, as did an enormous amount of
natural energy from Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seated atop a
field of golden lotuses, had become the heart of this
seemingly-infinite storm of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light swirled across
his entire body…and within it, a golden pellet Jindan took form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, his
divine body began to ravenously devour the power of the Solar Star
and the Lunar star. By the time everything came to an end and the
world turned normal again, Ning’s divine body was already beginning
to emanate a natural aura of majesty and power, an aura that belonged
exclusively to the most supreme of Empyrean Gods…because Ning’s
divine body had already reached the perfect level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.”
Brightmoon ran straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, still seated in
the lotus position, laughed as he hugged his daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, you are too
incredible!” In her father’s arms, Brightmoon raised her head to
look at him. Light was shining from her eyes. She would never, ever
forget the sight of her father being bathed in lightning, nor would
she ever forget the sight of the enormous Solar Star and Lunar Star
appearing above her father’s head as he sat there atop a bed of
golden lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heartbeat later,
Empyrean Gods Redsnow, Primelight, Snow Scorpion, Dovesnake,
Ninefangs, Sunblaze, and Darkmoon all moved in unison towards Ji
Ning. Looks of utter excitement were in their eyes, and the giant
yellow bear appeared as well. The eight of them looked towards Ning,
faces full of joy and anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…they all
knelt down respectfully on one knee. “Respectful greetings to you,
Manorlord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starseizing
Manor…was finally going to once more appear within the Three
Realms!

Chapter 6 - The Starseizer World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter still in
his arms, Ji Ning hurriedly rose to his feet. “Everyone, please
rise!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did the seven
Empyrean Gods and the giant yellow bear rise to their feet, their
eyes still filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, don’t
kneel before me.” Ning shook his head, his daughter still in his
arms. “I am nothing more than the heir to my master, Daoist
Threelives, which is why I was fortunate enough to become the
Manorlord of the Starseizing Manor. In terms of cultivation, all of
you have been training for far, far longer than I have. In terms of
power, I am just like the rest of you, a mere Empyrean God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Manorlord is the
Manorlord.” The dazzlingly beautiful white-browed woman, Snow
Scorpion, revealed a smile. “The Manorlord commands the Starseizing
Manor. We are your subordinates. We have to follow the rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s right,
Manorlord.” The bald old man, Ninefangs, let out a laugh. “Long
ago, countless Fiendgods would prostrate when our Godking gave an
order. Ahaha…just thinking about those days makes my blood boil.
Back then, I hadn’t even become an Empyrean God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, don’t…”
Dovesnake was about to say something as well, but Ning swept them all
with his gaze. “My rule is…you are not to kneel before me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow and the rest of
the seven exchanged glances. They could sense Ning’s resolve, and
so they no longer argued against him. They respectfully assented,
“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At his current level,
Ning’s Dao-heart was incomparably pure. He liked what he liked, and
he disliked what he disliked! There was no way Ning would allow the
old rules of the Starseizing Manor to bind himself. Ji Ning was
different from the former Godking, Daoist Threelives; Daoist
Threelives liked to dominate and liked to fight for supremacy in the
world, but Ning did not. He preferred to focused on increasing his
personal power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one was powerful
enough, one would naturally be able to dominate all those in one’s
path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa was a good
example. She had been the paragon of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s goal was to
reach Pangu and Nuwa’s level…and then to surpass them! But of
course, that was assuming Pangu’s level wasn’t the final stage
possible in cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many distant
spectators were all completely stunned. Amongst the many disciples of
Mount Innerheart, the vast majority of them, aside from the likes of
Patriarch Subhuti and Crazy Ji, did not know of the connection
between Ji Ning and Daoist Threelives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Mu Northson or
Autumn Leaf knew about it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Threelives?
He was a True God who was born from the vast, infinite primordial
chaos. According to the legends, the divine ability he created, the
[Starseizing Hand], is no less terrifying than [Houyi’s Archery].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So senior
apprentice-brother is actually the successor to Daoist Threelives?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Empyrean God
Redsnow and the rest of the seven had intervened during the Realmwar,
word had long since spread that these were the former followers of
Daoist Threelives. This resulted in his name once more being
discussed by the many Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms.
The likes of Mu Northson and Uncle White had naturally heard of the
story of Daoist Threelives as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the familiar
faces of his kinsmen and his fellow disciples with his gaze, then
nodded. “Daoist Threelives is my master as well. When I was young,
I was fortuitous enough to receive his legacy. From today forward…I
shall also be considered a member of the Starseizing Manor. Redsnow
and the rest of the seven are also Empyrean Gods of the Starseizing
Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Innerheart was
composed of members of many different organizations. For example, it
included the Flower-Fruit Mountain lineage, one of the most powerful
of Diremonster lineages. Ning had now become the commander of the
Starseizing Manor lineage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then does that mean
I’m also considered as belonging to the Starseizing Manor lineage?”
Northson laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess you could
just barely qualify as a member,” Little Qing chortled. “I’m
Master’s spirit-beast; I definitely qualify as a member.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you have suddenly risen to the exalted
rank of Manorlord of the Starseizing Manor. In the future, I imagine
that there will be many favors I will need to ask of you,”
Silvermoon said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, my
Starseizing Manor is still a bit weak. Senior apprentice-brother, why
don’t you join our lineage?” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had a total of
twenty personal disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eldest was the
woodcutter, while the second was Crazy Ji. Both of them were
Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third disciple,
Zen-Master Goldlight, had been a Golden Crow that was born from
within the Solar Star. He had incredible talent and shocking levels
of power, but he roamed the Three Realms and was difficult to locate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth disciple was
Lord Northriver. He had originally belonged to the primordial human
clan, but he was now the hegemon of a celestial river located within
the Celestial Realm, the ‘Northriver’. He had established the
Northriver clan there, and had more than ten Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals under his command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth disciple was
Silvermoon. Silvermoon had been born a Terrorbeast, and truly was a
demonic figure. He had unleashed a storm of blood and murder during
the Primordial Era, but then had calmed down. He had stayed in
seclusion in Mount Innerheart ever since, willing to be the guardian
of Mount Innerheart’s ‘Divinities Palace’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth disciple was
the leader of the Diremonsters of Flower-Fruit Mountain, Sun Wukong.
Long ago, when Mother Nuwa had repaired the damage to the Heavens,
she had used five-colored rainbow stones that were created through
distilling the essence of the Five Elements. One of the leftover
pieces, after having absorbed spiritual energy from Heaven and Earth
over the course of countless years, had then given birth to Sun
Wukong. Sun Wukong was truly a born genius who had trained even more
quickly than Ji Ning himself, almost instantly becoming an Empyrean
God! By now, he had even broken through to become a True God, and was
an extremely famous figure amongst the Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first six disciples
of Subhuti were all extraordinary, to say nothing of the fact that he
had fourteen more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join your
Starseizing Manor?” Silvermoon twirled his fan, a hint of
indecision on his face. “Y’know, that doesn’t sound like a bad
idea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon, if you were to join us, then the two
of us would each become the commander of a Three-Eyed God,” Redsnow
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Redsnow was
very confident in his power, he didn’t dare claim that he was
necessarily more powerful than Silvermoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My two junior
apprentice-brothers…” After pausing for a moment, Silvermoon
smiled as he looked at Ning. “I wasn’t joking just now. The storm
has arrived, and my peaceful days are about to come to an end. I’m
in no rush right now, but once I decide to rejoin the rest of the
world…then I shall do so as a member of your Starseizing Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Redsnow were
overjoyed! Both of them had just made casual invitations, but they
hadn’t actually expected Silvermoon to accept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The space around Ji
Ning and the seven Empyrean Gods turned blurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve already
entered the Starseizer world.” Redsnow pointed downwards, the eight
of them standing in midair. “The vast world beneath is us the
Starseizer world, the foundation of our Starseizing Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
willed it his coresense to spread out, and it rapidly expanded to
cover the entire Starseizer world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Manorlord has
incredibly powerful coresense; he’s actually able to encompass the
entire Starseizer world with it.” The beautiful Snow Scorpion
gasped in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Completely cover
it?” Ninefangs was absolutely shocked as well. “The Manorlord has
only trained for a century, but his coresense has actually reached a
level like this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Coresense’s power
came from the soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the more rapidly one’s soul would gain in power. For example,
the Primal level was beneficial to the soul, but the Void level was
even more beneficial. Upon becoming a Celestial Immortal, the Jindan
would be formed and the soul would be completely merged into it,
allowing it to improve at an even more shockingly fast pace. As for
the Pure Yang Jindan of a Pure Yang True Immortal, its effects on the
soul were even more astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what though,
nurturing the soul was something that required time. Ning’s true
body had just become a Pure Yang True Immortal moments ago, after
all! If he had been given a thousand years, his soul would naturally
be nourished by his Pure Yang Jindan to an extremely powerful level.
In that situation, none of them would be shocked by the power of his
coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had literally
just overcome his tribulation, and he had trained for merely a
century or so!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t forget that
Manorlord’s heartforce has reached the fourth stage,” Redsnow
reminded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say
anything to them. In truth, he was capable of encompassing the entire
world with his heartforce alone. If he was to use his coresense
through his heartforce, he would be able to encompass a much, much
greater area. However, that wasn’t particularly impressive; it must
be understood that the maximum coresense of a Daofather was capable
of encompassing the entire Three Realms. But of course, that would
only be possible for a short period of time, as it was incredibly
taxing to the soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning nodded
slightly. “The Starseizer world has a total of roughly 16,000
Celestial Immortals, 1,500,000 Loose Immortals, and more than 100,000
Void-level Fiendgods…it really is comparable to the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Void-level
Fiendgods have all existed since the Primordial Era.” Redsnow shook
his head. “In the countless years which have passed since then, the
only one who managed to break through was Ninefangs. None of the
others have made any breakthroughs. As for the sixteen thousand
Celestial Immortals…not a single Pure Yang True Immortal has
appeared amongst their ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said in surprise,
“Why is that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because the world
was severed from the rest of the Three Realms,” Primelight said
solemnly. “There’s no way for them to undergo any true tempering
and testing. Without enough pressure, without enough experience…it
is incredibly difficult for any of them to make any breakthroughs.
The Celestial Immortals of the Grand Xia are able to roam the entire
Three Realms and fight against some of the experts of the three
thousand major worlds and the Celestial Realm; naturally, a few will
make breakthroughs every so often.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starseizer
world, however, has always remained completely sealed off.”
Primelight shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been waiting
this entire time for our new Manorlord to be born. If no Manorlord
arises, then our Starseizer world would never reappear,” Redsnow
agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt tremendous
admiration for Redsnow and the rest of the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, nobody had
known if Daoist Threelives was still alive or not, and Threelives
hadn’t forced them or required them to remain loyal to him. Many of
his subordinates had left, but the seven of them had resolutely clung
to their duty to stand guard here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although our
Starseizer world doesn’t have that many Celestial Immortals or
Loose Immortals, we have more than enough to form a perfect Heaven
Punisher Formation.” Redsnow suddenly glanced sideways towards the
empty space next to him. The giant yellow bear suddenly appeared, who
stared in a pitiable manner towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bear.” Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of expectation
could be seen in the giant yellow bear’s eyes. “The treasures
which Master stored within the Treasure Hall were meant for his
various successors to use. Master didn’t know how many successors
there would be before an Empyrean God would emerge amongst them and
become the new Manorlord of the Starseizing Manor. Ji Ning…now that
you have become the Manorlord, you can go collect the three items
which Master left behind for you. There is a space which only the new
Manorlord can enter; not even I can enter it. For countless eons,
I’ve been wondering what the three treasures which Master left
behind are. I’ve been absolutely itching to find out! Hurry up and
go collect them and let me take a look at them. I promise I won’t
tell anyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
looked eagerly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three treasures?”
Ning said in surprise, “Didn’t my master, Daoist Threelives,
simply leave behind a few Pure Yang treasures for me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those were all for
the various successors, not the new Manorlord. Now that you have
become the Manorlord, all the treasures of the manor are yours, along
with the most important treasures; those three,” the giant yellow
bear hurriedly explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard of
this. The Godking once spoke to me about this as well.” Redsnow
looked towards Ning. “The Godking had already reached the Sixth
Cycle of his [Starseizing Hand]; his hand was far more powerful than
any Protocosmic spirit-treasures. They had already reached the
legendary Chaos treasure level! Thus, the Godking traded away the
most precious treasures he had to the other True Gods and Daofathers
in order to prepare these three treasures for you. You can say that
he did this to help our Starseizing Manor prepare to once more rise
to prominence…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, hurry up
and go collect them. My foster father didn’t tell us what the
treasures were either. All of us are also quite curious,”
Primelight said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was also quite
curious about what Daoist Threelives had left behind. He immediately
looked towards the giant yellow bear. “Big bear, lead the way.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 7 - Please Help Me, Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right on!” The
giant yellow bear excitedly spun around, instantly causing them to
teleport elsewhere in the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Starseizing
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the giant
yellow bear, Redsnow, Primelight, Snow Scorpion, and the others all
appeared within the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you can
wait here.” The giant yellow bear turned to look towards Redsnow
and the others. “The secret treasure vault is only accessible to
the new Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Redsnow
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unlike you, you big
bear, the rest of us are quite patient. Look at how eager you are!”
Primelight shook his head and snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant bear stared
at him. “Are things the same for you and me? I’ve been guarding
this place for countless eons now. It wasn’t so bad before, but now
that I know that Ji Ning has made his breakthrough and become the new
Manorlord, of course I’m going to be unable to control my
curiosity. I’m not to blame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, big bear.
Lead the way,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me.” The
giant yellow bear led the way, and Ning followed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bear and the man
walked through the hallways of the underwater estate. In truth, the
estate was quite vast; this was the place where Daoist Threelives and
his countless Fiendgod minions had lived, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you have
now become an Empyrean God and a True Immortal, you can completely
bind the Starseizing Manor,” the giant bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Later, I’ll
bind it completely.” Ning nodded. He was in no rush. The
Starseizing Manor was an estate-type treasure which held the
Starseizer world within it. Now that he had become an Empyrean God,
all he had to do was wait for Daofather Crimsonbright to send the
necessary Immortal pills to him. He would soon be able to reach the
Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], at which point in time
his body would be comparable to a top-grade Pure Yang treasure. Even
if he encountered any danger, there would be no need for him to hide
within the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he did need to
hide…Ning had collected Protocosmic spirit-treasures during the
Realmwar. The underwater estate was now much less important to him
than it had been in the past. However, it still held unique
importance for him; when he had been very young, it had been
extremely helpful to him in his growth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flew past a
curtain of water and arrived at a blurry spatial corridor. Ning and
the giant bear walked through the corridor, moving towards a place
which Ning had never been before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning saw that
at the end of this spatial corridor, there was a blurry barrier of
flowing light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
protective formation which Master left behind,” the giant yellow
bear said, pointing at the barrier. “Long ago, Master said that
only the new Manorlord would be able to open it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” As Ning
walked forward, he sent his coresense forward to investigate it.
Although he wasn’t exactly an elite formations expert, he still
knew a good amount regarding the art of formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open up.” After
analyzing it for a moment, Ning suddenly reached out with his palm.
The divine Starseizing Tattoo appeared within it, and he slapped his
palm down against the barrier. Light flowed atop the barrier as a
rune that was extremely similar to the Starseizing Tattoo appeared
atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s palm
transformed to become three hundred meters in size as he slammed it
down upon the barrier…but the only result was that the shockwave
forced him back three steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It didn’t open?”
The giant yellow bear was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not right now.”
Ning stared at the light barrier, then shook his head. “Let’s go
back for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t you open
it? Master said that the new Manorlord would be able to open it,”
the giant yellow bear said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “I
discovered just now that this barrier comes from the exact type of
energy as the Starseizing Tattoo. The only thing that can open it is
the Starseizing Tattoo, but when I tried just now, I discovered that
because my own tattoo isn’t complete enough or strong enough. I
imagine that only after reaching the Fifth Cycle can one open this
barrier. But of course, there’s another method; to rely on
overwhelming power to force it open! Although my master Daoist
Threelives was quite formidable, countless eons have passed since he
set up the formation. If I rammed against the formation he left
behind ten or so times, I’d probably be able to break through it,
but if I did that…the treasures which Master left behind might be
teleported away through some other mechanism.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You can’t
brute force it.” The giant yellow bar nodded hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke. It
was entirely possible that there was a secondary mechanism within
that would teleport the treasures away into the Void of space or into
some extremely dangerous regions once the formation was broken
through by brute force. How hard would it be to locate the treasures
once they were lost?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, counter-attack
formations might appear as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
turned and left. “I need to first train my [Starseizing Hand] to
the Fifth Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning first went to the
main hall of the Starseizing Manor to meet with Redsnow, Primelight,
and the rest. They were all eager to find out what relics Daoist
Threelives had left behind…but alas, Ning had been unable to
actually break through the formation for now. The seven of them had
no choice but to return to the Starseizer world for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Treasures
Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the treasures
of the Treasures Hall are here.” The giant yellow bear pointed
towards the ceiling as he handed Ning a book. “This book has a
record of all the Immortal-ranked and Pure Yang treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and
accepted the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually a
total of twenty-eight Pure Yang treasures.” Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement. “And that’s in addition to the Sole-Ki
Nine Elements Pearls and the Ananda World-Swords. All of the Pure
Yang treasures that Master left behind are fine specimens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the best Pure
Yang treasures, there were a few that were especially powerful. All
of them were set treasures, and the very best ones had their own
specialties; it was hard to say which was the definitive best.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Eight Fires
Qiankun World’, for example, had been forged by Elder God Zhurong,
who had already fallen during the war that ended the Primordial Era.
It had been forged with incomparably precious treasures into the form
of eight lotus petals. When the eight lotus petals completely
bloomed, they could unleash eight powerful streaks of truefire! It
must be understood that the entire Three Realms only contained nine
types of truefire, but this Eight Fires Qiankun World included eight
of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Elder God
Zhurong had fused some marvelous formations into this treasure of
his. Once all eight types of truefire were merged together into one,
they would possess utterly earth-shattering destructive power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang True
Immortals would most likely only be able to flee in the face of this
power. Only Empyrean Gods with powerful divine bodies would dare to
fight it head-on. Most importantly of all…this was an large-scale
area attack that was the size of a world. It could absolutely destroy
everything within its range! Thus, the Eight Fires Qiankun World,
despite ‘merely’ being a single top-grade Pure Yang treasure, was
worth more than a hundred ‘ordinary’ top-grade Pure Yang
treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also the
‘Grand Bloodshadow Formation of the Heavens’. It was composed of
a total of ninety-nine top-grade Pure Yang treasures, and once they
joined together to form ninety-nine bloodshadow clones, they would
have similarly astonishingly might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas, there are no
sword-formations, which is what I need.” Ning shook his head.
Although there were flying swords amongst the treasures, Ning need a
total of more than seven hundred Pure Yang flying swords. The vault
which Daoist Threelives had left behind simply didn’t include that
many items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The finest sets of
top-grade Pure Yang treasures which Daoist Threelives had stored in
his vault were some of the finest treasures of the Three Realms,
capable of allowing any Empyrean God or True Immortal to instantly
become far more powerful. Unfortunately…Ji Ning was no ordinary
Empyrean God or True Immortal. He had reached the fourth stage of
heartforce already. Once he mastered the Fifth Cycle of the
[Starseizing Hand] and the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art], he was already a supreme figure amongst his peers. The amount
of benefit these treasures would bring him was very limited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was simply too
powerful already. He didn’t need too much outside support.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or, to put it a
different way…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside support he
needed had to be of a tremendously powerful level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would naturally be
willing to risk his very life to acquire a Chaos treasure, but those
were far too precious and rare. Not even most Daofathers or True Gods
were in possession of one! One of the reasons why Daoist Threelives
had been so powerful was precisely because once his [Starseizing
Hand] reached the Sixth Cycle, his hands had become as powerful as
Chaos treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos treasures…only
the primordial chaos could give birth to treasures of such
astonishing, heaven-shaking power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left the
Starseizing Manor to visit his master, Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Subhuti’s
Daoist monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning
called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Subhuti looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple wishes
to train in the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], but needs some
materials to do so. These materials are very hard to gather. Your
disciple is willing to exchange treasures for them with you, Master,”
Ji Ning said. The Xia Emperor had once wanted to come up with enough
treasures for Ning to train to the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand], but…not even most True Gods or Daofathers were in possession
of those treasures. Most likely, they would have to seek out friends
and gather the items from many places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ji Ning
naturally had sufficient treasures to engage in the necessary
trading.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Realmwar
alone, Ning had acquired multiple Pure Yang treasures and two
Protocosmic spirit-treasures. However, those Pure Yang treasures were
not part of a set. Daoist Threelives had collected multiple sets of
top-grade treasures, which was exceedingly rare. The total number of
treasures, however, was enough to trade for the necessary materials
for him to reach the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the likes of the
Eight Fires Qiankun World or the Grand Bloodshadow Formation of the
Heavens? Any single one of those sets would be enough to trade for
the necessary materials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As your master, I
have yet to give you any gifts for your breakthrough into the
Empyrean God level.” Subhuti shook his head. “You can consider
the materials needed to reach the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand] as a gift from me. However, although I’m able to give you the
materials needed for the Fifth Cycle…I’m not able to give you the
materials you will need for the Sixth Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all the items
that could be used for him to cultivate his hands to the Chaos
treasure level were only locatable within the primordial chaos, and
extremely rare as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, Daoist
Threelives had been lucky enough to encounter a piece of golden
starstone in the primordial chaos. After analyzing the starstone for
countless years, he came up with a way to use the starstone, along
with many other materials he had located within the primordial chaos,
to develop the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]. Treasures like
that golden starstone, however, were incredibly rare. Per what Daoist
Threelives had said back then, Daoist Three Purities had also
encountered a piece of golden starstone, and had eventually used it
to create the Immortal Slaying Sword’s sword-diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell which materials
you need,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning began
to list them out one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti raised an
eyebrow. Smiling, he said, “This is actually rather difficult. I’ll
need to go find some of my old friends to acquire them. Wait a bit.”
Subhuti closed his eyes and sat there quietly for a few moments. A
short while later, a spatial vortex appeared next to him and an old
man dressed in Daoist robes appeared within it. The old man handed
Subhuti a brocade sack, then disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
the ‘old man’ was actually a created incarnation of his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all here.”
A brocade sack and a gourd appeared within Subhuti’s hands. “This
sack has the materials you need, while the gourd contains the Great
Firmament Immortal pills from Daofather Crimsonbright. There are more
than enough pills for you to train to the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke he waved
his hand, causing the brocade sack and the gourd to float towards Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
items. “Thank you, Master.” His heart was filled with delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training to reach
the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], he would be able to
acquire the relics left behind by Daoist Threelives. And, even more
importantly, his hands would become comparable to top-grade
Protocosmic spirit-treasures in might! Top-grade Protocosmic
treasures…they were second only to Chaos treasures. In addition,
once Ning used [Three Heads, Six Arms], he would essentially have
access to the equivalent of six top-grade Protocosmic weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protocosmic
spirit-treasures weren’t rare, as Ning had quite a few, as did the
Xia Emperor. But top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures…Ning hadn’t
even acquired a single one thus far!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you
planning to do next?” Subhuti said, looking at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning replied
respectfully, “Your disciple intends to roam the Three Realms,
tempering my Dao-heart in the mortal dust and meditating on my
sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If his heartforce could
make yet another breakthrough to the fifth stage…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although thus far,
Houyi had been the only one capable of it, making his own chances
quite low…if he really did succeed, then he would become supremely
powerful even amongst True Gods and Daofathers. Ning had a feeling
that the fifth stage of heartforce could only be found within the red
dust of the mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
reasons why Eastbreak and many of the others who had reached the
fourth stage of heartforce often spent most of their time roaming the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce wasn’t
something that could be forced. Thus, Ning would still spend most of
his time tempering his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, I’d like to
ask you for some help, Master,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help?” Subhuti
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “The
storm is now upon us, and the wars between us and the Seamless Gate
are unceasing. I want to ask you, Master, to help me seek out
opportunities to fight them. Alternately, give me targets to attack.
I’ll wipe some of the Seamless Gate’s headquarters and lairs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Targets to attack?”
Subhuti was surprised. “That’ll make the Seamless Gate go
berserk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate and
the Nuwa Alliance were like two massive armies that were facing each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
its major worlds, while the Seamless Gate has major worlds of its
own. Both sides would assault each other while defending against
enemy assaults.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
extremely formidable Empyrean Gods and True Immortals in the Three
Realms, but they would at most appear during a Realmwar. Outside of a
Realmwar, they wouldn’t dare launch an assault against a
headquarters of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you launch a
direct assault against one of their headquarters…although I can’t
sense any danger at present, once you attack they might send their
full force against you,” Subhuti said worriedly. “This is going
to be extremely risky. To launch sneak attacks without an army
supporting you…it will be very, very risky. Even if you succeed,
you’ll only succeed once or twice. Those successes will enrage the
Seamless Gate, and they will come up with ways to set traps for you.
If you repeatedly attack them and ambush them, you’ll probably end
up being trapped and ambushed by them instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand. That’s exactly what I want, for them to be enraged, for
them to go berserk. The more berserk they become, the more I will
attack them and the more of them I will kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have to do
this?” Subhuti looked at Ning. He didn’t understand. The more
powerful one was, the more one would understand how important it was
to protect one’s self during a war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Launching sneak
attacks…yes, the chances of success would be very high, but without
an army supporting you, if you failed, you would become easily
entrapped and perhaps even lose your life. Even if you succeeded, you
would become a top-priority target of the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are now quite
formidable, and you are capable of commanding a Heaven Punisher. The
Seamless Gate will have to pay an enormous price to deal with you.
Thus, they’ll treat you exactly the way they do the likes of Lu
Dongbin. They won’t actively act against you, as you have already
reached a high level of power. The reason why they wanted to kill you
earlier was because you were weak, because you hadn’t grown up
yet,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You had to nip
potential threats in the bud. Once they actually became serious
threats, however…by then, the Seamless Gate wouldn’t really be
willing to pay the enormous price necessary to get rid of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please help me,
Master,” Ning said respectfully. Where were the headquarters of the
Seamless Gate? Which ones were the best to assault? Which ones should
be left untouched? Patriarch Subhuti would be thousands of times
better than him in making these decisions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you tell me the
reason?” Subhuti looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am going to rescue
Yu Wei,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rescue? She’s not
dead?” Subhuti was shocked. “She isn’t dead…how do you know
this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “She’s
not dead. Her soul is currently suffering unspeakable torments at the
hands of the Godking within his Infinity Hells. The reason I know
this is because prior to this, the Godking tried to force me to join
him. He told me that if I didn’t join him, he would have her suffer
endless torment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti instantly
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t help but
look carefully at this disciple of his. He could completely imagine
how agonizing this choice had to be for him. And yet…despite
feeling such despair, his disciple had actually been able to break
through in power and reverse the course of an entire Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am going to rescue
her, and this is the only method available to me,” Ning said. “I’m
going to kill them. Kill, kill, kill them! Kill them until they are
enraged. If they send one person to deal with me, I’ll kill one; if
they send ten, I’ll kill the entire group. I’ll kill them until
they rage turns to fear, until their fear turns to regret, until they
finally come to make peace with me! But I’ll only stop my slaughter
once they release her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to slaughter
them until they truly regret it. Only then would they be willing to
release her.” Ning looked at Subhuti. “This is the only way I can
rescue her. Please help me, Master.”

Chapter 8 - The Relics Of Threelives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at Ji
Ning. He was silent for a few moments, then said slowly, “You are
taking a tremendous risk. You are trying to force the Seamless Gate’s
hand…but to force them to make peace with you…to make the proud,
exalted Seamless Gate sue for peace…that is going to be incredibly
hard. You should understand what sort of a path you have decided on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a path filled
with danger and death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Daofathers
wouldn’t personally intervene, the Seamless Gate still had other
methods at their disposal for dealing with Ning. For example, using
human wave tactics! They could hide a Realmwar’s worth of Immortals
and Fiendgods into an estate-type magic treasure an attack Ning, or
produce multiple Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on Lu Dongbin’s
level and have them surround Ning! Sufficiently high numbers of
Immortals and Fiendgods could threaten even Daofathers, to say
nothing of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would be walking
on a tightrope! The path forward led to success…but falling off on
either side would lead to death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Subhuti
said softly. “If you push yourself far enough, sometimes a miracle
will happen. The only thing I can do is help you locate appropriate
targets amongst the headquarters of the Seamless Gate. Everything
else will be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
Ning was overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be as
careful as possible,” Subhuti instructed. He himself had only
learned just now that this disciple of his had made the choice to
thrust Yu Wei into the Infinity Hells. Subhuti couldn’t help but
sigh, yet remained powerless to change things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Subhuti
nodded, then closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning bowed
respectfully, then turned and left the Daoist monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving, Ning
returned back to his own residence, then entered the Still Room of
the Starseizing Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He seated himself atop
the netherwater jade bed, then took out the brocade sack and the
gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, the
[Starseizing Hand].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, five streaks
of light flew out from the brocade sack and swirled around him in the
air in a pentagon. They shone brilliantly with dazzling golden light,
warm blue light, vigorous azure light, fierce red light, and
ponderous yellow light. They contained such deep concentrations of
Five Elements essence that one could sense them clearly, even without
engaging in training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those crystals that
were glowing with a watery blue light, for example…the tiny pile of
crystals gave off a sensation akin to a vast, endless sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes as
the surrounding Five Elements essences began to surge towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training in the
[Starseizing Hand] and the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was quite fast;
both techniques were techniques that involved training the physical
body to become as powerful as magic treasures. Thus, the only
requirements were fully understanding how the techniques worked and
having enough materials. It was the same as actually forging a
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked out from
the Still Room and arrived in the main hall. He immediately saw the
giant yellow bear, Redsnow, and the rest of the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations.”
The giant yellow bear clasped his furry paws together and bowed.
“You’ve mastered the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],
and your starseizing hands are now comparable to Protocosmic
spirit-treasures. Ji Ning, these two mighty divine abilities alone
are enough to allow you to roam the Three Realms without fear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With your arcane art
having reached the Ninth Cycle, you are now almost invulnerable.
Congratulations,” Redsnow said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It would be
wonderful if I could also become apprenticed to Patriarch Subhuti and
learn the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],” the child-sized Primelight
said, shaking his head and sighing. “The Manorlord and elder
brother Redsnow have both become apprenticed to Subhuti. Redsnow in
particular…he’s absolutely ancient, but he’s shameless enough
to force his way into becoming our Manorlord’s ‘junior
apprentice-brother’. And he chose to start learning the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] shortly after he joined their school!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to learn it
as well.” The alluring Snow Scorpion looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which Empyrean God
wouldn’t?” Ninefangs mumbled to himself, “Back when I was just
a minor soldier under the command of the Godking, all I was qualified
to do was to listen to him lecture. Even now, I can’t actually
learn his techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone else began to
grumble and grouse. As for Ning and Redsnow, they just listened, not
daring to say a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this was
something which virtually every single Empyrean God of the Three
Realms felt jealous over. The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] had long been
revered as the number one divine ability in the Three Realms for
those below the True Immortal level! However, training in this divine
ability was simply too insanely expensive, especially for the Ninth
Cycle; the price for that was far greater than the price for reaching
the Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daofathers would
feel heartache upon paying such a price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the seven
Empyrean Gods had rendered major merits during the Realmwar without
taking any share of the spoils, which was why Daofather
Crimsonbright, a True God and Daofather who had been born from the
primordial chaos, had been able to swallow the painful price
necessary to provide Ning with that gourd of Immortal pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at the sour
looks on each of your faces. Enough, enough!” The giant yellow bear
hurriedly urged, “Hurry up and have Ji Ning go and break apart the
seals which Master left behind. Let’s go see those three
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! Those three
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what those
three treasures are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, hurry up
and go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come straight back
and tell us right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of Primelight,
Snow Scorpion, and the others all lit up. They no longer grumbled or
spoke words of jealousy, and instead urged Ning to go take a look
right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m quite curious
as well. Wait for me here. I’ll come back shortly and inform you
all.” Ning immediately left behind the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the giant yellow
bear and Ji Ning arrived at that spatial corridor, as well as the
glowing formation that lay at the end of the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning
slapped out with a palm, transforming it and making it three hundred
meters in size. His palm carried a terrifying aura of power with it;
it was like the heavens themselves were smashing downwards. The power
of his palms was noticeably greater than it had been before. When
Ning’s palm slapped down against the protective formation, a layer
of light flowed across its surface as a rune that looked similar to
the Starseizing Tattoo appeared on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Starseizing
Tattoo and the rune merged together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The formation
simply disappeared, as though having been blown away by a gust of
wind. Ning immediately saw the wooden door in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He walked forward,
immediately pushing it open. Creaaaaak. The door swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bear, let’s go
in together.” Ning turned to look at the giant yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no. Master’s
orders were explicit; only the new Manorlord is allowed to enter.”
The giant bear shook his head. “Those treasures aren’t for me
anyhow. After you come out, just tell me what they are and let me
take a look at them. I’ll be satisfied with that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
stepped inside the room without any further attempts at persuasion.
As he entered…his surroundings changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
stunned. This was a very ordinary little room. Within the room was a
prayer mat, and atop the prayer mat sat a bald, one-armed man who was
dressed in fur clothes. He looked towards Ning with a hooded gaze.
Ning could immediately recognize this man; it was Daoist Threelives.
When Ning had been taught the [Starseizing Hand] divine ability, he
had personally seen Daoist Threelives’ appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have arrived.”
The man spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood that this was nothing more than part of the spell left
behind by his teacher. These words had been spoken by Daoist
Threelives long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For you to enter
this place means that you have already mastered the Fifth Cycle of
the [Starseizing Hand]. I, Threelives, finally have a successor.” A
calm, distant look was in Daoist Threelives’ eyes. “When I was
alive, I wasn’t able to find a good successor. For me to find one
after I die…it is enough. I don’t have any requests to make of
you. I only ask that you treat with kindness those who have decided
to continue to protect the Starseizing Estate. I suspect that Redsnow
will stay behind, but I am uncertain about the rest. The heart is
hard to fathom, after all. When I was alive, they were loyal to
me…but after I die, it’s hard to say. As for the guardians…I
hope that you will treat them kindly. If there are any Pure Yang
treasures within the Treasures Hall which suit them, please give them
to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you…I have
prepared these three top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures for you.
I hope that you will survive to make yet another breakthrough,
becoming a True God and a Daofather. Let my [Starseizing Hand] truly
become renowned throughout the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was able to
develop the [Starseizing Hand] due to a series of lucky karmic
encounters. Alas, although I am a True God, I was unable to master a
Heavenly Dao and become a Daofather. Otherwise, my [Starseizing Hand]
would become even more powerful.” Daoist Threelives shook his head.
“But of course, that’s nothing more than a bit of empty pride. As
for the path you shall take in the future, that will be entirely up
to you. Even if you want to dissolve the Starseizing Manor and let
everyone go their separate ways, that’s fine. I only ask that you
treat the guardians of the Starseizing Manor with kindness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow, Eastbreak,
Primelight, Dragonsong…how many of them are willing to stay behind,
I wonder?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threeelives then
shook his head and chuckled. “Forget it, forget it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His figure disappeared
into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned for a
moment…then he hurriedly knelt down and kowtowed heavily. He
kowtowed in thanks for Daoist Threelives having shown him such
kindness in transmitting the Dao to him. If it hadn’t been for the
legacy of Daoist Threelives, Ning probably wouldn’t have been able
to become as accomplished as he now was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although many of the
Immortals and Fiendgods under your command have left, there were
still some who resolutely stood guard over the Starseizing Manor.
Don’t worry about the seven of them. I will definitely treat them
well,” Ning said solemnly. This was a solemn oath. No one had been
around to force the seven of them to wait there patiently for so
long. None of them had any idea as to how long they would have to
wait, but they had been willing to do so. In truth, Ning himself felt
tremendous admiration and respect for those seven Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waved his finger.
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! The lids atop the three boxes in front of the
prayer mat all opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the box on the
left was a large amount of beads, each of which emanated an utterly
shocking aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second box in the
middle contained a small, seemingly-ragged wooden boat that was the
size of his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third box on the
right contained a small golden pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are the new
Manorlord of the Starseizing Manor?” A small bald monk dressed in
golden robes emerged from the surface of the small golden pagoda.
“You’ve finally come. We’ve been trapped here forever. I’ve
gotten sick of this place long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the rush?
Take things slow.” An old man dressed in simple clothes appeared
from the small wooden boat. He looked like an old farmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally.” A
slender, handsome-looking child appeared in the air above the
countless beads, seated in the lotus position. His gaze, however, was
the fiercest and sharpest of the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and
introduce yourselves, the three of you,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old man, you speak
first,” the handsome child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The simple old man
nodded. “This old man is the spirit of this raggedy old boat. This
boat is known as the Voidboat. Long ago, when Heaven and Earth were
established, a bead of pure energy was formed from the essence of
Heaven and Earth. After 84,000 years, this bead gave birth to the
boat. It can shatter the Void itself. It moves so fast that in terms
of speed, it was ranked as one of the top five treasures of the
Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidboat is very
fast,” the handsome child said calmly. “During the Primordial
Era, there were only two Chaos treasures that were suited for
high-speed movements. One was in Mother Nuwa’s hands, while the
other is in Daoist Three Purities’ hands. In the entire Primordial
Era, only those two treasures surpassed the Voidboat. Based on what
Threelives’ said, he prepared the Voidboat for you as a life-saving
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am meant for use
in fleeing as well.” The small bald monk standing atop the small
golden pagoda laughed merrily. “This little pagoda was formed from
some unique treasures of the primordial chaos. It is extraordinarily
profound and arcane, and was titled by Threelives as the ‘Nine
Lives Pagoda’. Once you bind this little tower to yourself, you can
tap into the profound energy within the tower to create nine
incarnations of yourself. These nine incarnations will all have power
equal to your own. They can use fleeing divine abilities to flee at
high speed, but when they do, they’ll use up the energy inside of
them. Once the energy is all used up, the incarnations will
dissipate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even True Gods
or Daofathers will be able to tell any of the nine incarnations apart
from each other. However…you absolutely cannot allow these
incarnations to actually fight people. Once they do, then the enemy
will realize that the incarnation is not using divine power or
Immortal energy and instantly realize that it isn’t ‘real’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nine
incarnations are principally meant to allow you to flee and to
distract the enemy, not for you to use them in combat. Their value
lies in the fact that if they don’t engage in battle, there’s
simply no way to tell which is real and which is not. Not even Mother
Nuwa was able to tell them apart.” The bald little monk said
confidently, “Daoist Threelives had been wondering as to whether or
not to bring me into the war, but he heard from Nuwa that there would
be extremely terrifying figures in this battle, and that the Nine
Lives Pagoda wouldn’t be of much use within it. Thus, he left it
behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. So
both the Voidboat and the Nine Lives Tower were meant for fleeing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the war that
destroyed the Primordial World, some of the major powers like Subhuti
hid themselves, only occasionally intervening to rescue a few people.
Threelives had known that the enemy was incredibly powerful, second
only to Pangu. Even the Nine Lives Pagoda would be of limited use…but
Threelives had still decided to go and face their foes head-on. He
truly was a bold, valiant man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you?” Ning
looked towards the handsome child seated atop the beads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome child
looked back at Ning. “Both of them are meant for fleeing. I,
however…am meant for killing your foes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s the supreme
killing treasure,” the old man above the Voidboat agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s quite
savage,” the small bald monk nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome child
swept the two with a cold glance. Both of them beamed back at him in
a rather silly manner. The handsome child then looked back towards
Ning. “All three of us are top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures,
but controlling them is fairly easy. I, however…I’m not something
which ordinary Empyrean Gods or True Immortals can control. I am a
supreme killing treasure. If you can’t control me, I urge you to
hurry up and relinquish me to Daoist Three Purities and have him give
you a more appropriate treasure in exchange.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t control?”
Ning was startled briefly, then laughed. “You haven’t even told
me your name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind me first,”
the handsome child said coldly. “If you can control me…then I’ll
tell you my name.”
</P>

Chapter 9 - The Thirty-Six Heavens
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly
willed the pile of beads to fly into the air. They spread out like a
dazzling river of stars, filling the entire room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“3600 beads,” Ning
mused softly to himself, then chuckled. “Bind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Pure Yang energy
spread out in 3600 streaks, covering each and one of the beads with
his power. He bound them in but an instant, leaving behind his soul
imprint upon them. Protocosmic spirit-treasures were the easiest of
all treasures to bind; as long as the spirit of the treasure didn’t
resist, then even mortals would be able to bind them by dripping a
drop of blood onto them, which would create the necessary soul
imprint within the spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon binding the beads,
Ning instantly could sense everything that was held within the 3600
beads. He instantly sucked in a cold breath. “This restrictive
spell…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was so profound as
to be illegible and incomprehensible. It was vast, profound, arcane,
and utterly unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I imagine
you’ve just discovered the seals?” The handsome child said with
cold arrogance, “The primordial chaos is filled with countless
stars. Once a star dies, its essence will be crystallized into a
crystal core. When Pangu established Heaven and Earth, some of these
crystal cores entered Pangu’s World by happenstance. These 3600
crystal cores were nourished by the energy of Pangu’s newly formed
world, resulting in them transforming into the stargold beads. Every
single stargold bead is a Protocosmic spirit-treasure, and is capable
of transforming into almost anything, including swords and sabers.
These 3600 beads resonate with each other, forming a perfect whole.
They definitely are the most supreme of Protocosmic
spirit-treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eventually, Daoist
Three Purities acquired me. Daoist Three Purities, after mastering
Yin and Yang, began to rove the primordial chaos. Thanks to a stroke
of great karmic luck, he ended up discovering a set of nine chaos
seals. He could sense that these nine chaos seals were unspeakably
profound, and so he decided to erase the many previous seals that he
had placed within me, replacing them with the nine chaos seals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a result, the
power of these beads increased dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, these chaos
seals were simply too unfathomable and mysterious.” The handsome
child looked towards Ning, then said proudly, “Even in the
Primordial Era, there was not a single person who was capable of
fully binding and controlling the nine chaos seals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one at all?”
Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are chaos
seals! They appeared within the primordial chaos and contain utterly
unfathomable mysteries,” the handsome child said confidently. “Back
then, Daoist Three Purities had invited Mother Nuwa herself to try to
bind them, but even she had been only capable of binding the eighth
chaos seal. But of course, Mother Nuwa only spent three years trying;
if she spent a few trillion more years, she probably would’ve been
able to completely master bind them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was truly stunned
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had been
incredibly powerful, but it had taken even her a full three years to
master the eighth chaos seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives had
placed the treasures in this place prior to the war that destroyed
the Primordial Era. Thus, back then Mother Nuwa hadn’t mastered the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos and hadn’t reached Pangu’s
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities kept me by his side for countless years, but was only able
to bind the seventh chaos seal.” The handsome child said
confidently, “The chaos seals were immaculately born by the
primordial chaos itself. How could mere human power compare to it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nine Chaos Seals
might be formidable, but during that great war, Mother Nuwa ended up
breaking through to reach Pangu’s level.” Ning chuckled, “If
Mother Nuwa was to try again, I’d imagine she’d be able to
succeed this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangu’s level?”
The handsome child was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Mother Nuwa
reached Pangu’s level?” The old man above the wooden ship was
shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply incredible.”
The small bald monk’s face was filled with veneration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’d be wonderful
if I ended up in Mother Nuwa’s hands! Only then could I be used to
my full potential.” A look of desire was in the handsome child’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed and
‘berated’ him, “You brat, not even Daoist Three Purities used
you, to say nothing of Mother Nuwa.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities has Chaos treasures.” The handsome child’s voice was
filled with some degree of resentment. “Every single Chaos treasure
was born from the primordial chaos. They are born with chaos seals
within them that are perfectly joined together, and thus they possess
tremendous power. Although I have chaos seals within me as well, they
were added in later. Naturally, that makes them a bit inferior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The small bald monk
teased, “The main issue is that you are too hard to bind and
control. In the end, not a single one of the major disciples of
Daoist Three Purities was willing to use you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because
they have no vision.” The handsome child shook his head
disdainfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
was the leader of the Daoist Path. He had many treasures, and was a
master at refining pills and forging artifacts. He was thus able to
infuse the nine chaos seals he found into the stargold beads, but it
had still been extremely hard to do! He had many treasures but only a
few disciples. He had given each of his most favored disciples,
including Lu Dongbin a chance to acquire the stargold beads, but in
the end they had each decided to forgo the beads and had chosen other
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, “Perhaps
after one masters all nine of the chaos seals, your power will be
simply extraordinary…but even Daoist Three Purities was only able
to master seven of the seals. His disciples naturally understood that
treasures that suited them would be better choices.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m the
supreme killing treasure!” The handsome child stared at Ning in an
extremely prideful manner. “Do you know? Daoist Three Purities used
me as the master blueprint for his creation of the sword-diagram for
his Immortal Slaying Swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal Slaying
Swords’ sword-diagrams were modeled after my nine chaos seals.
Daoist Three Purities joined four mighty Chaos swords together, then
infused them with seven layers of seals of his own devising. That’s
the reason why it has such extraordinary power, and why the Immortal
Slaying Swords were reputed to be the number one killing treasure of
the Primordial Era. But in terms of the profoundness of the seals?
The seven seals which Daoist Three Purities devised simply cannot
compare to the nine chaos seals inside me.” The handsome child
looked at Ning. “Daoist Three Purities said himself that even
though I am ‘only’ a supreme Protocosmic spirit-treasure, anyone
capable of mastering and controlling all nine chaos seals would be
able to unleash a level of power that was no lower than that of his
Immortal Slaying Sword Formation. That’s why I’m the supreme
killing treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honestly, he’s the
only one who calls himself that.” The old man on the boat
snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More like the
meanest killing treasure,” the small bald monk agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone capable of
binding all nine seals would probably be on Pangu’s level. By then,
every single casual punch or kick would be comparable to the power of
the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation,” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You guys…!” The
handsome child was frantic with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, enough. You
are pretty formidable.” Ning laughed. “Let me give those nine
chaos seals a test first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be able
to bind at least one of the chaos seals if you want to be able to
control me at all. Otherwise…the only way you’ll be able to use
me is as little balls to throw at people. It’d be a complete waste
of my status as the supreme killing treasure.” The handsome child
said arrogantly, “Very, very few Empyrean Gods or True Immortals
can master even the first chaos seal. Generally speaking, it’s
impressive for even Daofathers to be able to master three of the
chaos seals. Daoist Three Purities had to spend countless years in
order to master seven of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just sat down in
the lotus position, completely focusing his heart and mind on binding
the chaos seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 3600 stargold beads
levitated in the air above Ning, glowing with light as dark golden
runes flowed over them, transforming as they did so. No matter how
long one stared at them, the divine runes would constantly change and
appear different from the ones that came before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the chaos
seals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They would constantly
change, never remaining constant and forever transforming. It was
like the circular ratio, ‘pi’, of the human world, a number that
stretched off into infinity with no pattern. The chaos seals were
similarly without any pattern or end. The only way to master them was
to master the fundamental essence that lay beneath them. When Daoist
Three Purities had found the nine chaos seals, he had been stunned
and shocked by them. He had spent a total of 120,000 years in the
primordial chaos meditating on them. After sensing that he had gained
a basic understanding of them, he had chosen to infuse the nine chaos
seals into the 3600 stargold beads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas…he had only
been able to completely copy and infuse the nine chaos seals into the
beads! As to comprehending and mastering them? He was far from it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply
inconceivable. So the chaos seals are actually this arcane and
profound.” Ning’s mind was completely focused on the seals. He
felt like an ordinary mortal on Earth who was staring at the vast,
seemingly infinite stars of the Milky Way. He wasn’t capable of
knowing what was on a single one of those stars…and yet, before him
lay the entire Milky Way…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning to
feel a sense of despair that halted him in his very tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beautiful. Simply
beautiful. Simply stunning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was definitely the
most profound, the most stunning seal which Ning had ever seen! Not
even the mysteries of the Heavenly Daos could even come close to
comparing to these nine chaos seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me focus on the
first chaos seal for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning focused all of his
efforts into understanding the most basic, the most simple, and most
rudimentary chaos seal; the first seal. By now, Ning was applying the
full force of his powerful heartforce in analyzing the chaos seals.
This was extremely taxing on his heartforce and extremely exhausting.
However, thanks to the fact that his heartforce had reached the
fourth stage, Ning was able to force his way into completely binding
and mastering the first chaos seal in one try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first of the nine
chaos seals began to wriggle about like a tiny tadpole…then
completely disappeared, having fallen under Ning’s control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
His eyes were filled with strange divine runes which flowed through
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder my master,
Daoist Threelives, procured this treasure for me.” After mastering
the first chaos seal, Ning instantly understood. “The disciples of
Daoist Three Purities are most likely all extremely close to the
Daofather level. I, however…I’ve only mastered the Grand Dao of
the Sword. I haven’t even mastered the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop,
to say nothing of the Heavenly Dao of Water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
extremely powerful, his power came from his heartforce and his divine
abilities. As for the Dao? Ning was very, very far away from being
able to comprehend the Heavenly Dao of Water. The likes of Patriarch
Lu, Silvermoon, and Redsnow had long ago mastered multiple Grand
Daos. They were extremely close to mastering a Heavenly Dao; in fact,
some of them had reached the final bottlenecks. Upon breaking through
the final bottlenecks, they would become Daofathers! Ning, however,
hadn’t even mastered the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop. He was very,
very far from their level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the Grand Dao of
the Waterdrop was this simple.” Ning could clearly sense that his
insights into the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop was rising at a simply
monstrous rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having
encountered the incomparably profound and exalted chaos seals, he
could sense that mastering the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop would
become far simpler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure is
tremendously beneficial to me in comprehending the Dao and in
improving my sword-arts. Compared to those seals…my sword-arts are
simply too crude.” Ning had already found the right direction for
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense.” Ning
willed it, and whoosh! The 3600 stargold beads actually began to
merge together. Every ten beads joined into one, resulting in a total
of 360 larger goldstar beads. Ning, however, felt great pressure when
he did this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense!” Light
flashed in Ning’s eyes. He was forced to employ his heartforce.
With heartforce guiding his Immortal energy, he was able to cause the
360 goldstar beads to once more merge together to form a total of 36
goldstar beads. Every single goldstar bead emanated an utterly
shocking amount of power. By now, controlling them was just as hard
as controlling a perfect Heaven Punisher; he had to employ his
heartforce in order to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! You are able
to condense me into the Thirty-Six Heavens?” The handsome child
levitating next to Ning cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can that be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just controlling
those 3600 beads is incredibly difficult. Only a fraction of the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the universe are even able to
bind and control them. As for controlling the supreme Thirty-Six
Heavens, there are no Empyrean Gods or True Immortals who can do such
a thing. This is something which only Daofathers can do!” The small
bald monk was shocked as well. He turned to look towards the handsome
child. “Were you just bragging in the past and spouting hot air in
front of us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true that only
Daofathers can perfectly bind the beads into forming the Thirty-Six
Heavens.” The handsome child repeatedly shook his head. “Daoist
Three Purities had his most formidable disciples all give it a try,
but none of them were able to succeed. If they were, there’s no way
they would’ve been willing to give me up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stared towards Ning
in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
completely occupied by the sensation of unearthly might that came
from the Thirty-Six Heavens.
</P>

Chapter 10 - Leaving The Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a treasure.”
Ji Ning stared at the thirty-six hovering stargold beads. After the
thousands of beads had condensed into thirty-six, every single bead
contained utterly enormous amounts of power. In addition, every
single bead contained a heavenly world within it, with each one being
comparable in size to the Grand Xia! However, these Thirty-Six
Heavens were only capable of persisting for a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when the 3600
beads were compressed into 36 beads would they transform into the
Thirty-Six Heavens. Once Ning withdrew his heartforce and his energy,
the Thirty-Six Heavens would once more disperse back into a cluster
of thousands of tiny stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thirty-Six
Heavens. Each one of them is comparable to a major world. Even if you
just smashed people with them, they would still possess enormous
power. However, controlling them is quite onerous, at least as
onerous as commanding a perfect Heaven Punisher.” Ning realized
that keeping these beads in the Thirty-Six Heavens form was extremely
difficult and tiring. The reason why he could do it was because he
had powerful heartforce and a soul heartforce technique. There really
weren’t many Empyrean Gods or True Immortals who could do what he
did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.” Ning
willed it, and the Thirty-Six Heavens hovering in the air instantly
began to transform in shape, first transforming into thirty-six
flying spears, then into thirty-six battle standards, and then into
thirty-six hoops.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, these
stargold beads can transform into a myriad of things,” the handsome
child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning came to
a halt. Glancing at the handsome child, he said with a calm smile,
“Am I hearing things? Did you just call me ‘Master’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palm-sized child
stood there in midair. He said solemnly, “Master, you were able to
bind and control the first of the nine chaos seals. You were even
able to condense the 3600 stargold beads into the Thirty-Six Heavens.
I imagine that there are very few Empyrean Gods or True Immortals in
the entire Three Realms who can compare to you, Master. To be able to
follow you is my good fortune.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaaa?” The old
man atop the wooden boat stared wide-eyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were so
mean-looking earlier. Now, all of a sudden, you’ve become so meek?”
The small bald monk mumbled to himself as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is very
formidable.” The handsome child swept them with his gaze, then said
icily, “You are fortunate to be able to follow him. I will
naturally follow him with complete willingness. In the future…I
might have some karmic luck of my own as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome child then
looked towards Ning, a scorching heat in his gaze. “Long ago,
Daoist Three Purities had his most powerful disciples test me out,
but not a single one of them was capable of immediately mastering the
Thirty-Six Heavens. In fact, Daoist Three Purities once said that
this was something which only True Gods and Daofathers would be able
to do. But you, Master…you did it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This little fellow’s
flattery skills were quite extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a question,”
Ning said. “What is the name of this treasure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stargold Beads
of the Heavens,” the handsome child said. “When I was first born,
before the nine chaos seals were fused into me, I was already capable
of transforming into the Thirty-Six Heavens! Although shifting me
into that form is very difficult, once one can do so, it’ll be like
one can strike against foes with the combined power of thirty-six
major worlds! But of course…the amount of power you’ll actually
be able to control will be up to your abilities, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stargold Beads
of the Heavens?” Ning nodded. “Is the transformation into the
Thirty-Six Heavens the ultimate form? But why is it that I have a
strange feeling that it shouldn’t be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you’ve
noticed it as well?” The handsome child was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities and Mother Nuwa discovered it as well,” the handsome child
said hurriedly. “The form with the 3600 beads is the first and most
ordinary form. The second form has 360 beads, while the third form
has the 36 beads that comprise the Thirty-Six Heavens. This should be
the ultimate form, but…both Daoist Three Purities and Mother Nuwa
had the feeling that there should be way to merge all 3600 beads into
one. Upon doing so…they can transform into an actual star, like the
Solar Star or the Lunar Star. However, neither Mother Nuwa nor Daoist
Three Purities were able to come up with such a way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. To
combine them all into one? It seems his senses weren’t off.
However, if neither Mother Nuwa nor Daoist Three Purities had been
able to accomplish it…this would clearly be a very, very difficult
path to tread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for what would
happen when they all fused into one…if it would be able to
transform into a star like the Solar Star or Lunar Star…that was
just the conjecture of Mother Nuwa and Daoist Three Purities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure is
extremely hard to control. It’s not very suitable for others, but
it’s perfectly suited for me. In all the Three Realms…I am the
number one Empyrean God and True Immortal when it comes to
‘control’.” Ning felt quite delighted with himself. Although
his divine abilities were formidable those were only of use in close
combat. A straight application of heartforce in combat used it up at
an astonishing rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine archers, for
example, would use up all of their heartforce in just ten or so
arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, treasures that
could be used to attack at long range were very important. This was
especially true because his soul heartforce technique, in and of
itself, used up very little heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After binding the three
Protocosmic spirit-treasures, Ning walked out of the room and
returned to the main hall, where Redsnow and the others were frantic
with impatience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only disclosed the
existence of the Voidboat and the Stargold Beads of the Heavens. As
for the Nine Lives Pagoda, he kept that a secret. The other two items
he would use quite often, and so there was no need to hide them. As
for the pagoda, however, the more mysterious it was the better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
acquired the most powerful Pure Yang treasures which Master
Threelives left behind,” Ning said. “Master left word and
instructed me to be kind to the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who
have stayed behind to guard the Starseizing Manor. If you need any
treasures, just tell me. All of the Pure Yang treasures are listed
within this book.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning handed over the
book which the giant yellow bear had given him. “All of you, take a
look,” Ning immediately urged. These Pure Yang treasures were of
limited help to him, and none of his family members such as
Brightmoon, Autumn Leaf, Uncle White, or Mu Northson were Celestial
Immortals. The only Celestial Immortal he was close to was his
master, Diancai, but Ning had already prepared an even more suitable
treasure for Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was a
newly ascended Celestial Immortal, after all. If he acquired an
excessively powerful treasure such as the Eight Fires Qiankun
World…that would actually prove to be a calamity for him, not a
blessing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
Redsnow was the first to peruse the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me too.”
Primelight craned his neck over to take a peek.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Pure Yang
treasures which the Godking left behind are all quite nice.” They
all praised the Godking’s treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow looked towards
Ning. “Ji Ning, Sunblaze and Darkmoon have been with the Godking
for a long period of time, and so the Godking gave them suitable
treasures long ago. Primelight was the Godking’s son, so he goes
without saying. As for myself and Snow Scorpion…we were two of his
commanders, and so the Godking gifted us with appropriate treasures
long ago as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These treasures
aren’t particularly important to us, but I believe Dovesnake needs
a treasure. So does Ninefangs; back then, he was merely a Void-level
Fiendgod. He only made his breakthrough to become an Empyrean God
after much time passed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dovesnake and Ninefangs
both hesitated…but in the end, both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dovesnake chose the
Pure Yang treasure, ‘Yin-Yang Twin Poles Disc’. This could only
be considered an above-average treasure amongst the many Pure Yang
treasures Ning had, but Redsnow and the others all nodded in
agreement. Clearly, the Yin-Yang Twin Poles Disc was extremely
well-suited to Dovesnake. The ‘best treasure’ for a person wasn’t
necessarily the most powerful treasure, it was the most suitable
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back when Dovesnake had
followed the Godking, he hadn’t been particularly favored. This was
because Dovesnake was a venomous Godbeast that looked docile but was
actually savage. Threelives didn’t really like his personality that
much! He preferred those who were open and aboveboard. Even if a
subordinate was vicious and crafty, he preferred it when they were
obvious about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ninefangs, he
ended up choosing an extremely powerful top-grade Pure Yang treasure,
the Grand Bloodshadow Formation of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefangs’ true form
was that of a bat. The Grand Bloodshadow Formation of the Heavens was
indeed very well-suited to Ninefangs. However, because this set was
one of the best treasures which Ning had, Ninefangs had been
extremely hesitant to choose it. Only after Redsnow and the other had
encouraged him had he decided upon it. This caused Ninefangs to feel
tremendous gratitude to Ning, and it further solidified his loyalty
to Ning. After all, although Ning had said that this was on
Threelives’ orders, Threelives’ had died long ago. It was
completely up to Ning as to whether or not he was willing to hand
these items over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself honestly
didn’t mind. There was no point in him having that many unused Pure
Yang treasures by his side. If the Empyrean Gods under his command
all had formidable treasures, that would increase the power of his
strike force. That was a good thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” After
having handled the above matters, Ning went by himself to meet with
Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Subhuti was
seated in the lotus position. He opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
“Your disciple is preparing to leave the mountain and to leave the
Crescent world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you finished
your arrangements?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished
them.” Ning said respectfully, “Your disciple’s Primaltwin is
going to stay with Brightmoon, Uncle White, Little Qing, Bluecliff
Xiaoyu, and junior apprentice-brother Northson here at the Crescent
world. The Crescent world is, at present, a rare oasis of peace
within the Three Realms. I don’t wish for Brightmoon to be in
danger, and so I’ll have my Primaltwin stay with her as she roams
the Crescent world, allowing her to experience more things and grow
up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded. “Right.
The army of Immortals that belongs to your Starseizer world…what
formation do you plan on using with it? The Heaven Punisher
Formation? True God Xingtian has nodded and permitted you to continue
using it. I have other formations that you can use, but they are only
on par with the Heaven Punisher Formation. Do you want to switch?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head. “Your disciple is already quite familiar with the
Heaven Punisher. There’s one more thing I would ask of you,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Subhuti
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple is
going to act against the Seamless Gate, but first I want to deal with
Youngflame Freak and Evergreen,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two? Alright.
Once an opportunity arises, I’ll notify you.” Subhuti nodded.
“After you leave the Crescent world, you have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded respectfully, then asked, “Should I have Redsnow stay here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. I’ve
already taught him what needs to be taught, and he’s already
learned what he needs to learn. The rest is up to him,” Subhuti
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He was
going to take the entire Starseizer world with him when he left. The
seven Empyrean Gods would also follow his lead; he was the Manorlord,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll go
summon Redsnow and the others. After we are all gathered, please send
us away, Master. Your disciple bids you farewell,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Subhuti
closed his eyes, and Ning respectfully began to walk away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must be
careful.” Subhuti’s voice once more rang out within Ning’s
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning was
momentarily startled, then assented as he left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
led his daughter Brightmoon, Autumn Leaf, Uncle White, Little Qing,
Mu Northson, and Bluecliff Xiaoyu down into the Crescent world,
beginning their adventures through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My daughter’s left
the mountain.” Ning, Redsnow, and the others all stood there atop
Mount Innerheart, watching from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A twisted spatial
vortex suddenly appeared above the grasslands in front of them,
leading to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning led his
seven Empyrean Gods into the spatial vortex, leaving this garden
world. What was awaiting Ning on the other side of the spatial
vortex?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, a storm of
blood!
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_11___The_Number_One_Swor"></A>
Chapter 11 - The Number One Sword Immortal Of The Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the seven
Empyrean Gods appeared in midair. They immediately saw the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia located directly beneath them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master actually sent
me to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia? Eh, might as well go pay
a visit to my master, Diancai.” Ning turned and looked towards the
seven nearby Empyrean Gods, then said, “I’m going to roam the
Three Realms and temper myself in the red dust of the mortal world.
Unless something comes up, there’s no need for you seven to always
be following me. As I see it, you can go back to the Starseizer world
for now. If there’s anything important, I’ll send a mental
message to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not
acceptable”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can you have no
subordinates by your side, Manorlord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone
began to argue against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the new
Manorlord of the Starseizing Manor. You aren’t a rogue cultivator!”
Redsnow immediately argued, “If you don’t want all of us to
follow you…then how about this? Let’s just have Ninefangs follow
you and serve you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
glanced towards Ninefangs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefangs was the last
of the seven to break through to the Empyrean God level; when Daoist
Threelives had been alive, he had merely been a Void-level Fiendgod.
However, he physically looked the oldest. Upon hearing Redsnow’s
words, Ninefangs hurriedly said, “Manorlord, when roaming the Three
Realms, there will always be some minor, trifling matters to handle.
We can’t let you be forced to personally deal with everything, can
we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having just acquired
the Grand Bloodshadow Formation of the Heavens, Ninefangs was quite
eager to show his gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, fine.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then the rest of us
will return to the Starseizer world.” Redsnow and the rest of the
six immediately departed, returning to the Starseizer world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he first
paid a visit to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia to visit
Immortal Diancai, the Xia Emperor, and his cousin Yuchi Xiyue. Ning
had originally planned on having his master Immortal Diancai
accompany him, but Immortal Diancai declined. But of course, he
didn’t decline the Pure Yang treasures which Ning gifted to him. He
chatted with Ning for a long while, giving him some advice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Early
next morning, the white-robed Ning walked out of his room, followed
by the bald elder, Empyrean God Ninefangs. The two of them teleported
straight out of the Grand Xia, heading towards a minor world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had a
trillion minor worlds. There were simply too many of them, and every
so often old minor worlds would be destroyed and new minor worlds
would be born. Thus, only a tiny number of these minor worlds were
actually named!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The minor world which
Ning and Ninefangs had headed towards, however, did have a name. It’s
name was ‘East Phoenix’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“East Phoenix world.”
Ning stood at the peak of a mountain, the bald elder Ninefangs by his
side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is one of the
Twenty-Seven Worlds of Fuju.” Ning swept it with his gaze, able to
see to the very end of the East Phoenix world. “It lives up to its
reputation as one of the places where Daofather Fuju once lived. East
Phoenix world has countless different landscapes and far more
cultivators than ordinary minor worlds. It even has a Celestial
Immortal standing guard over it! It seems as though the three
disciples of Daofather Fuju are quite cautious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The exalted number
one Sword Immortal of the Three Realms…he actually perished, his
soul lost forever.” Ninefangs shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly,
sighing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons why
Ning was voyaging across the Three Realms was in order to search for
a way to allow his heartforce to break through once more. A second
reason was to meditate on his sword-arts! If he couldn’t find the
first, he would spend his time cultivating the second.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, Ning would
pay a visit to the ‘Twenty-Seven Worlds of Daofather Fuju’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was born a human and
trained as a Ki Refiner. He had become a Daofather of the Great
Firmament during the Primordial Era, and became famous due to his
sword. He had managed to train his swordforce all the way to the
fifth level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce was just
like heartforce; it could also be divided into five levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one reached the
fifth stage of swordforce, one would be considered supreme even
amongst True Gods and Daofathers. This Daofather Fuju became publicly
acknowledged as the number one Sword Immortal of the Three Realms
because, back when the Primordial Era had ended and the Three Realms
Era began, he had created a supreme sword-art which had stunned the
Three Realms…the [Five Treasures] sword-art. By relying on this
sword-art, Daofather Fuju had become the indisputed number one Sword
Immortal of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends, Daofather Fuju’s sword was indescribably fast,” Ning
sighed. “So fast that it surpassed the limits of speed established
by the Dao of the Heavens. When ordinary True Gods or Daofathers
fought against him, they wouldn’t even be able to block his sword.
In power, he was very close to the leaders of the Daoist Path and the
Buddhist Sangha. I imagine that he is on par with my master himself.
But alas, such a peerless figure ended up dying within the primordial
chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t even know
how he died.” Ninefangs shook his head as well. There were records
of the many events which had occurred after the Primordial Era ended.
Primelight, Ninefangs, Snow Scorpion, and the others had been in
seclusion for far too long; it was only after they emerged and began
to read these records that they began to learn of these things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, many major powers perished, including even Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Three Realms
Era, there were naturally major powers who had perished as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the affairs that
had particularly shocked the Three Realms was the death of Daofather
Fuju. The only information that was known was that he had died in the
primordial chaos. As for how he died or who killed him? Nothing was
known. Someone who was publicly acknowledged as the number one Sword
Immortal of the Three Realms, a figure who was comparable to
Patriarch Subhuti and Old Man Yuan, and was extremely close to the
Three Emperors of Mankind, Daoist Three Purities, and Lord Buddha in
power…had died, just like that. Many were thoroughly stunned by
this news. Subhuti and the others had searched for the reasons behind
his death, but they hadn’t found anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Fuju died…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twenty-Seven Worlds
of Fuju became incredibly popular!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because when
Daofather Fuju had trained in the sword, he would sometimes leave
behind some of his sword-arts on the mountains or in underground
caves when the mood struck him. These remnants of his sword-arts
contained unfathomable power which not even Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals would dare touch. When Daofather Fuju had been alive, his
disciples would often go to these twenty-seven worlds to analyze the
sword-arts he had left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Three Realms? They generally
wouldn’t have a chance to do so. But then, Daofather Fuju died. His
disciples were merely Empyrean Gods and True Immortals; they
naturally wouldn’t dare to keep these twenty-seven worlds for
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…they opened the
worlds up to the public!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Immortals or
Fiendgods of the Three Realms could come here to meditate on the
remnant sword-arts left behind. The only restriction was that no one
was permitted to cause any damage; if anyone did, that person would
become the common enemy of countless Immortals and Fiendgods! And in
truth, given that the remnants contained the might of the number one
Sword Immortal of the Three Realms…how many would be so suicidal as
to attempt to destroy them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the
twenty-seven worlds had remnants of his sword-arts left behind on
them. Some had more, some had less.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most exalted world
was Sword Immortal world, because it contained the complete set of
the [Five Treasures] sword-art within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
twenty-six worlds, they just contained some scattered, incomplete
remnants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, after travelling
through all of the worlds, the various Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals would generally choose to gather upon Sword Immortal world.
Very few of them would remain on the other twenty-six worlds. During
normal, peaceful times, there would perhaps be more than a thousand
of them on Sword Immortal world. Sometimes they would spend a million
years or a hundred million years cultivating on that world! However,
since the Three Realms was gripped by a great storm, most of the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals had joined the armies of their
respective realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were now very few
of them left on Sword Immortal world, to say nothing of the other
twenty-six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Fuju was
acknowledged by all as the number one Sword Immortal of the Three
Realms. I naturally have to go and analyze his sword-arts,” Ning
said. “Ninefangs, let us first wander East Phoenix world and the
rest of the twenty-six. We’ll save Sword Immortal world for last.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ninefangs
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninefangs flew
through the air, moving towards a giant, towering mountain. Because
East Phoenix world was merely a minor world, it had a circumference
of just a hundred thousand kilometers; it was actually smaller than
Swallow Mountain! It took them only a very short amount of time to
fly to their destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few people
here.” Ning glanced downwards. There were mountain peaks below
them, and at the base of the mountain peaks sat many Immortal
cultivators and Diremonsters. They were in the lotus position,
quietly meditating and training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, even the
most powerful are merely at the Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal
level,” Ninefangs said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Normally, Sword
Immortal world would have plenty of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
East Phoenix world would have a good number of Celestial
Immortals…but given the current status of the Three Realms, the
Celestial Immortals have all been ordered to join their respective
armies. Naturally, the strongest remaining figures are at the Loose
Immortal level.” Ning swept the mountains below with his gaze.
There really were many cultivators seated there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast majority were
actually Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang Adepts. They were all seated on
prayer mats which had been left behind by the Empyrean God and True
Immortal disciples of Daofather Fuju. This was to provide them with
organized seating for their meditations. Otherwise, if all of them
just haphazardly squeezed together, how could anyone calm down and
concentrate?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, I’ll
move them away,” Ninefangs said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. Look; that
little Diremonster is planning to give us a seat.” Ning chuckled as
he pointed towards a skinny, horned Diremonster who sat in the very
first row of seats. The Diremonster stared unblinkingly at the
mountain cliffs, but his eyes were bloodshot. Blood was beginning to
leak from his mouth; clearly, he was beginning to succumb and go
insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts left
here were simply unfathomably profound. They had been left by a
Daofather! If you gave up when you couldn’t understand, you would
be fine, but if you tried to force your way through…you’d easily
go insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed
it, and whoosh! The Diremonster instantly disappeared into thin air,
with Ning then appearing onto that prayer mat. The Immortal
cultivators around him were all focused on their meditations.
Although two or three of them noticed Ning appear, they didn’t pay
too much attention to him. Ning and Ninefangs were both keeping their
auras reserved as they wandered the Three Realms. Otherwise, if they
were to release their Empyrean God auras, they would’ve terrified
all of the Immortals and Fiendgods present to the point of quivering.

Chapter 12 - Meditating
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll meditate
here. Ninefangs, you can either meditate as well, or go find some
other things to do,” Ji Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Ninefangs said respectfully. He then flew to a distant winehouse. He
was going to stand guard in the surrounding area, ready to carry
Ning’s orders whenever necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny little
Diremonster who had vomited blood stared around blankly. “What…why
am I here.” The area around him was filled with the waters of a
flowing river. This was not the meditation area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t I on Mount
Dashcloud? Right…I went too far just now. I almost went crazy. Some
expert must’ve intervened and rescued me.” The little monster
felt fear for what had almost happened. In Ning’s eyes, he was
nothing more than a ‘little monster’, but in truth he was a
Primal-level Diremonster. His heart had been filled with hatred, and
he had deeply desired to gain insight into a profound sword-art to
take revenge. However, he had been too forceful in his attempts to
cultivate and so had fallen into madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it was very
risky for anyone below the Celestial Immortal level to meditate on
the sword-arts of a Daofather. The path of Immortal cultivation,
however, was a path filled with many pitfalls. There were many, many
stories of those who had developed powerful sword-arts after having
gazed upon the sword-arts of a Daofather. It was very common for one
to gain sudden insight on Mount Dashcloud, resulting in them
establishing a school of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, there were often
many weak cultivators who would come here to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position, staring at the sword-arts that had been left behind
upon the mountain walls. The mountain walls were protected by layers
of formations, none of which were particularly special; they had most
likely been left behind by Daofather Fuju’s Empyrean God and True
Immortal disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-intent which
radiated towards him, however, truly stunned him. He felt as though
it was stabbing into his very heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What powerful
sword-intent. The scars on the mountain wall that were created by
casual blows from his sword-arts…countless years have passed, but
they are still this terrifying.” Ning stared at the scars
carefully. These had been left behind by a supreme Sword Immortal
that was on Subhuti’s level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? That’s odd.”
Ning immediately had a strange feeling as he stared at the scars.
“There seems to be a fundamental difference between these
sword-arts and the other Daofather-created sword-arts I studied at
Mount Innerheart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The style is
completely different…as though they belong to two completely
different schools of thought.” Ning frowned. “But what exactly is
different…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was searching for
the answer. Ning was now an Empyrean God and a True Immortal. He was
a master of the sword, and was extremely talented in this regard. He
could immediately sense that something was different. It was a very
indistinct, blurry feeling…and Ning wasn’t immediately able to
pinpoint what exactly was causing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have it.” Ning
had a sudden thought. He waved his hand, and a stargold bead appeared
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already bound
all of the stargold beads. As a Protocosmic spirit-treasure, it could
be controlled by Ning to reveal no presence or aura whatsoever. It
was like a completely ordinary item right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
3600 stargold beads had been infused with the nine chaos seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The chaos seals.”
Ning stared at the constantly changing runes that flowed over the
surface of the stargold bead. The runes were changing ceaselessly,
never repeating in any discernable pattern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The
sword-arts of Daofather Fuju remind me of the nine chaos seals. They
feel very similar.” Ning immediately realized what the difference
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-arts
created by Daofathers are generally bound by the mysteries of the Dao
of the Heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Daofather Fuju’s
sword-arts, as well as these nine chaos seals…they seem to have
surpassed the Dao of the Heavens,” Ning mused to himself. “The
nine chaos seals were discovered by Daoist Three Purities when he
roamed the primordial chaos. It makes sense for them to have
surpassed the Heavenly Daos, as they sprung forth from the primordial
chaos. But Daofather Fuju’s sword-arts have surpassed the Heavenly
Daos as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Heavens
was the Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms! They were the laws that
governed the functioning of the Three Realms. Outside the Three
Realms…the Heavenly Daos were without effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, in the
primordial chaos, only the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos would
function. The other nine Heavenly Daos were useless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
stories, Daofather Fuju’s sword was shockingly fast, surpassing the
limits of the Dao of the Heavens,” Ning mused. “Perhaps this is
the reason why Daofather Fuju’s sword-arts were so terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to carefully
meditate on this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon noting the
similarities between the nine chaos seals and Daofather Fuju’s
sword-arts, Ning immediately began to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he
would switch over to meditating on the nine chaos seals. Whenever he
reached a roadblock, he would then switch to meditating on his
sword-arts. He would compare and contrast the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unexpectedly, Ning
began to discover that the previous bottlenecks he had encountered
when training in the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop and the Grand Dao of
Qiankun were actually easy to break through. Clearly, the insights he
had gained into the nine chaos seals and Daofather Fuju’s
sword-arts were of tremendous benefit towards him in training in
other Grand Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefangs had once more
come to the distant winehouse to drink wine. The winekeeper had long
ago grown accustomed to this bald old man, because he had often come
here to drink during the past month…and always chose to drink the
extremely venomous ‘Five Immortals wine’. Another name for this
wine was the ‘Five Venoms wine’, because it was created through
matching and mixing nine different venoms together. It was truly
toxic, but it was also incomparably delicious. A Zifu Disciple would
die upon having a single sip; one had to at least be a Primal Daoist
in order to be able to savor this wine without perishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is some of our
finest Five Immortals wine. Please enjoy, honored guest.” The
winekeeper personally delivered the wine and two appetizers to
Ninefangs, who leisurely poured himself a cup.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gurgle. He raised his
head and drank the wine. A twin sensation of fire and ice
simultaneously flooded his entire body, causing him to feel extremely
comfortable. Ninefangs laughed and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ninefangs
suddenly had a strange feeling. He immediately turned his head to
look towards the distant Mount Dashcloud. He gazed towards the
white-robed youth that was seated amongst many other figures at the
base of Mount Dashcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Dao?”
Ninefangs was surprised. He then hurriedly sent mentally,
“Congratulations, Manorlord, for having mastered the Grand Dao of
the Waterdrop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you the
sensitive one? I was just testing things out, and you immediately
sensed it,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in an
excellent mood. He had always had a high degree of affinity towards
the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop. This past month of analyzing the nine
chaos seals and the Daofather’s sword-arts had been extremely
taxing, and his progress had been rather limited…but he actually
ended up breaking through all bottlenecks and completely
comprehending the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, he had mastered
two complete Grand Daos. The Grand Dao of the Sword and the Grand Dao
of the Waterdrop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-arts here
on Mount Dashcloud were left behind by casual strikes from Daofather
Fuju; they aren’t that profound. The next month or two here won’t
be of much help to me.” Ning didn’t hold too many hopes towards
the rest of the twenty-six worlds either; the most important world
was the final one, Sword Immortal world. Still, Ning was going to be
very cautious and deliberate in his cultivation. He would first take
a look at all of the twenty-six worlds; perhaps they might be of help
to him in meditating on the complete [Five Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second month after
Ning’s arrival at East Phoenix world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow hung
high in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large ship came
sailing in through the heavens. There were many soldiers atop the
desk of the ship, as well as many beautiful women who were
surrounding a youth that was drinking wine merrily. He’d give a
pinch here and a caress there, filling the ship with shrieks and
giggles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Highness, Mount
Dashcloud is right up ahead,” a pale-faced, beardless man said
respectfully in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We arrived?” The
beautifully dressed youth rose to his feet. The beautiful woman in
his arms followed his gaze as he stared at the distant Mount
Dashcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My beauties, be good
and have a nice rest. I’m going to go meditate on sword-arts for a
while,” the youth chortled. The beautiful women all said a few
flattering words, causing the youth to feel absolutely tickled.
Still…this youth was qualified to act this arrogantly. He was the
third prince of the East Phoenix Dynasty of this planet, and the most
talented of all the princes. His status was quite special.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the prince led
his pale-faced attendant and a host of guards to the base of Mount
Dashcloud. The weakest of his guards were at the Wanxiang Adept
level, with the two commanders being Primal Daoists. As for the
prince, he himself was a Primal Daoist as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people? So
many monsters as well.” The prince frowned. “According to what
Master told me, the Three Realms is in the midst of a storm…which
has resulted in our minor world becoming more peaceful than ever
before. Still, there are now almost no Celestial Immortals who come
to our world. The most powerful cultivators here are merely on the
Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal level. Longxiu, hurry up and shoo
away one of the people at the front.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Highness, you
must not be rash. Although the strongest figures at Mount Dashcloud
are merely Loose Immortals and Earth Immrotals, some might have
powerful backgrounds,” the pale-faced attendant hurriedly
cautioned. “In addition, you yourself are merely a Primal Daoist,
your Highness, and your two guards are merely Primal Daoists as well.
Don’t anger those Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals. You might end
up suffering because of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prince nodded
slowly. “Fair enough.” Although he didn’t really actually care
about those Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals…right now, at least,
he wouldn’t be able to beat them in a fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then pick one of the
weak ones.” The prince swept the people present with his gaze.
“There should be some weaklings amongst the twenty-seven prayer
mats in front, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nobody who can sit
in the front would be truly weak. Let me take a look.” The
attendant hurriedly took a good look. “Twenty-one of the prayer
mats in the front are occupied by Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals;
they give me a sense of tremendous pressure. The other six give me
much less pressure; they should merely be at the Primal Daoist level.
Your Highness, which of the six do you think I should pick?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prince took a
careful look. “Four are monsters. Monsters who have reached the
Primal level are generally much more powerful than humans of the same
level. That leaves two…that white-robed youth, and that
grim-looking man. The grim-looking man has a terrifying, baleful look
in his eyes; I imagine his sword-arts must be quite formidable. That
white-robed youth looks fairly unremarkable, though. I imagine he’s
just an ordinary Primal Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power amongst Primal Daoists. Some were monsters who could
challenge Void-level experts. The baleful aura around the
grim-looking man was definitely proof that he was no ordinary Primal
Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go with that
white-robed kid,” the prince said. “Hurry up and shoo him away.”

Chapter 13 - Sword School
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your humble servant
will go right now.” The attendant chortled, then walked forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Dashcloud was
extremely large, and there were many regions from which one could
view all of the remnant sword-scars left behind. The first row only
had twenty-seven seats, but there was a distance of more than thirty
meters between each seat. This way, everyone could train calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant walked
straight towards Ning. “Fellow Dao-” the attendant began to say
in a shrill voice, reaching out to pat Ning on the shoulders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When training, Ning had
his heartforce spread out to cover this entire minor world. He was
completely focused on his meditations and on the sword-scars left
behind by Daofather Fuju. He was mentally deducing and inferring one
type of sword-art after another! He had already visualized thousands
of different types, more than ten of which were more powerful than
the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he
would gain an insight from the visualized sword-arts. This would
allow Ning to walk farther and farther along the path of swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ning
was completely focusing on deducing yet another powerful sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone patted him on
the shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
startled awake…and all of the effort he had put into analyzing this
sword-art went completely to waste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heartforce has
covered this entire minor world. If any Empyrean God or True Immortal
arrives, I should have found out long ago. Who the hell just
disturbed me?” Ning was rather displeased. One of the greatest
taboos was disturbing others when they were meditating. Ning
immediately turned his head to look towards the pale-faced attendant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could immediately
tell that this person was merely a Primal Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist,”
the attendant said, pointing at the prayer mat beneath Ning. “My
prince wishes to meditate on sword-arts and needs a spot. He’s
taken a fancy to your spot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned, then
looked backwards. He saw the beautifully dressed youth ensconced by
many guards. The youth gave Ning a sideways glance, seemingly quite
disdainful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know what
to do.” A look of arrogance was in the attendant’s eyes. As he
saw it, once this white-robed youth saw that there were three Primal
Daoists accompanying the prince, he should be able to guess that the
prince had an extraordinary background. Immortal cultivators
generally understood the principle of courting fortune and avoiding
misfortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t bother me
when I’m meditating on the Dao.” Ning gave the attendant a cold
glance, then shut his eyes and continued to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” The
attendant pointed at Ning, rendered momentarily speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, don’t
make trouble for yourself!” He barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
him. Given his power and his status, these little fellows were as
weak as ants in the face of his might. Ning wouldn’t care too much
if a few ants bellowed at him; he simply couldn’t be bothered to.
In addition, this was Mount Dashcloud, a place for meditating on the
sword-arts of a Daofather. Generally, very few would dare to actually
attack someone here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning believed that this
person would just yell at him a bit, then leave helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Highness.”
The attendant ran back to the prince’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
The prince was rather irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That white-robed kid
is like a stone. He’s quite tough. He completely ignored me,” the
attendant said helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s courting
death.” The prince’s face sank. “Attack. Kick him out of here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” The attendant
said hurriedly, “This is Mount Dashcloud, a place for meditating on
the Daofather’s sword-arts. Any disturbances will interfere with
the meditations of countless Immortal cultivators and Diremonsters.
All of them will be furious with us. It’s one thing for us to
irritate one of them, but we can’t irritate all of them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re not going to
kill him, we’re just going to kick him out.” The prince said with
a frown, “Those who are truly focused on their meditations won’t
be startled awake by some fights in the outside world. The ones that
will wake up are the ones who aren’t in a true meditative state
yet. Also, set up a small formation around him when you attack. That
way, you won’t disturb the people around him, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you,
go!” The prince gave the orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant and the
two commanders shared a glance, then acknowledged the order. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them
immediately walked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A crystalline globe of
fire appeared before the attendant’s chest. Instantly, a barrier of
flames appeared around them, surrounding Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist!”
The attendant barked loudly, his voice exploding by Ning’s ears
like thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
He gave the three a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and leave.
Give up your seat. Otherwise…don’t blame us for showing no
mercy,” the attendant barked. The two nearby commanders became
filled with auras of power as well. The Immortal cultivators and
Diremonsters who were nearby all halted their meditations, focusing
their attention on the area around Ning with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amusing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare
for people to fight at Mount Dashcloud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three are a
bit too brash. If the fellow wants to give up the seat, that’s one
thing, but they actually intend to force him from it? Even if they
really want to give him a drubbing, they should wait until he leaves
Mount Dashcloud. Why rush?” The surrounding Immortal cultivators
and Diremonsters all chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very common for
Immortal cultivators to get into fights over minor matters, but it
was rare for something like this to happen at Mount Dashcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unwilling to give up
your seat? Fine. Once you leave Mount Dashcloud, don’t blame me for
showing no mercy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of a threat
like this, most weaker cultivators would obediently give up their
seats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two commanders
barked out as well. They both had extraordinary backgrounds; they
wouldn’t care about an ordinary Primal Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Insolence.” A cold
light flashed through Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…an invisible
wave surged out, striking against the bodies of the three Primal
Daoists. The attendant and the two guard commanders were just about
to attack, but they suddenly sensed a wave of unearthly power crash
over them. They were knocked backwards, and the commander who had
told Ning to ‘f*ck off’ began to scream in agony as soon as he
landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHH! AHHHHH! M-m-my
Zifu…my Zifu…” The commander’s voice was filled with agony
and terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other, chubbier
commander fell on the ground alongside the attendant. The two of them
clambered to their feet, staring at their comrade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-his Zifu was
destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
filled with utter terror. The three of them had been knocked flying
in a single clash, with one of them having his Zifu
destroyed…although they all had extraordinary backgrounds, this was
exactly why they had been unwilling to offend any of the Earth
Immortals or Loose Immortals. Although they had extraordinary
backgrounds, it would take time for reinforcements to arrive. If they
were crippled in the interim, that would be a miserable outcome, and
so they had sought out the white-robed kid, who had appeared to be
the easiest to bully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We just rammed into
a steel plate,” the chubbier commander muttered. “A steel plate
with nails.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bullshit!” The
prince roared. The chubbier commander instantly no longer dared to
say a word. In secret, however, he celebrated the fact that it was
his comrade who was the one to speak rudely, as was usually the case.
This time, his comrade had really suffered for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Highness,”
the attendant said hurriedly. “This person is very powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How dare you cripple
my man?” The prince had a terrifying look in his eyes as he stared
daggers at the distant Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The worst part of the
situation was that more than half of the Immortal cultivators and
Diremonsters seated below Mount Dashcloud were watching this event
with curiosity. They weren’t like Ning, after all, who could easily
go into a months-long meditative state. They were far weaker than
him, and the Daofather’s sword-arts were far too profound. They had
to stop extremely frequently, after just meditating on the sword-arts
for a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For so many cultivators
to stare at him…the prince felt even more embarrassed and angry,
and he shifted all of it towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.”
The prince strode forward, his attendant and the chubbier commander
hurriedly following behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prince’s voice
was clear, but it carried anger in it. “Your actions are quite
vicious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just shut his eyes
again, completely ignoring him. The prince didn’t dare to actually
act against Ning himself; he had seen Ning attack earlier. The prince
was a mere early-stage Primal Daoist; how could he be a match for
Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My five junior
apprentice-brothers!” The prince called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, five figures
descended from the top of Mount Dashcloud. Each of them had powerful
auras. They were all at the Loose Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Loose
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five Loose
Immortals who stand guard over Mount Dashcloud for the Sword School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This youth actually
addresses the five of them as ‘junior apprentice-brother’? Can it
be that he is also a member of the Sword School? However…judging
from his age, I would’ve thought those five Loose Immortals should
be much older than him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you really need
to ask? If he dares to address the five of them as ‘junior
apprentice-brother’, then he must be a true, formal disciple of the
Sword School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I recognize him.
He’s the third prince of the East Phoenix Dynasty. He has been
accepted by Celestial Immortal Triscorpion as his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s the
case. Seems like the white-robed man is doomed. He’s offended a
formal disciple of the Sword School…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The white-robed man
really doesn’t know his limits. He should know that his opponents
must have powerful backgrounds, for them to dare act in such a brash
manner here at Mount Dashcloud. He should’ve been more cautious.
Look at him now. He’s pissed off a major foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone
began to discuss this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Loose
Immortals all landed, the cultivators and monsters around them making
way before them. None of them dared to offend the Sword School. The
five Loose Immortals all bowed courteously towards the prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Eastluck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior
apprentice-brother Eastluck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five Loose
Immortals had all been alive for more than a hundred thousand years,
but they all spoke out with great courtesy. They were disciples of
the Sword School, but they were merely outer disciples, not core
disciples, which is why they had been sent here to maintain order.
Their task was to ensure that the beautiful surroundings of Mount
Dashcloud were not damaged…or, to put it another way, they were
gate guards. The prince before them, however, was a true disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he really is a
disciple of the Sword School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at that gold
medallion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the
Sword School is actually a very powerful school of the Three Realms.
The founder was Daofather Fuju himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, yet another
storm of discussion arose. The Sword School had been founded by
Daofather Fuju, and in the past its status had been equivalent to
that of Mount Innerheart! However, Daofather Fuju had died. When
trees fall, the monkeys that lived in it would scatter. In addition,
Daofather Fuju was fairly mediocre in teaching disciples; he hadn’t
been able to produce a single Daofather. Thus, only three Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals continued to remain within the Sword School.
The current Sword School wasn’t even as strong as the Starseizing
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But despite that, it
was still a school with three Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, and
with many friends spread throughout the Three Realms. Thus, it could
be considered one of the top-tier schools of the Three Realms. A
formal disciple had a status that was far higher than the status of
an ordinary Void-level Earth Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This man actually
dared to be disrespectful to our Sword School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Loose
Immortals flew towards Ning like streaks of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes
again. He gave them a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His gaze struck against
their bodies as though it had taken solid form. The five of them once
more transformed into streaks of light, but this time they flew
backwards…and they flew so far away that they could no longer be
seen with the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look
towards the prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” The prince
was so terrified that he hurriedly stumbled backwards. In his terror,
he fell backwards and tumbled to the ground in a sitting position.
This was too terrifying. He hadn’t even seen what technique this
man had used! It seemed as though the man had merely used his gaze to
send those five Loose Immortals flying. The guards behind him were
utterly terrified as well. None of them even dared to breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A streak of
light flashed, and a bald old man appeared next to Ning. He hurriedly
said respectfully, “Manorlord, your subordinate came late.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed calmly. “A
minor matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ninefangs was
utterly enraged right now. He had been taking a sweet nap just now,
right next to the winehouse. As he was an Empyrean God, his senses
were naturally still spread out to cover the surrounding area. If any
slightly powerful figures such as Celestial Immortals came over, he
would’ve immediately noticed. But the prince and the others were
mere Primal Daoists; Ninefangs simply didn’t pay them any attention
at all. It wasn’t until Ning had released his power with that look
that Ninefangs had been shocked awake…only to discover that someone
had actually come to make trouble for his Manorlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dare to offend
my Manorlord? Are you looking to die?” Ninefangs glared furiously
at the prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still seated on the
ground, by now the prince understood that this white-robed youth had
to have a truly extraordinary background as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a disciple of
the Sword School.” The prince hurriedly pulled out a golden
insignia, clutching it as if it was his last hope. “I’m a formal
disciple of the Sword School. My master is a Celestial Immortal
Patriarch. Master is standing guard here at East Phoenix world! My
grand-master is Patriarch Daoless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefangs, we’re
here to analyze Daofather Fuju’s sword-arts, after all; let’s be
courteous about this,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prince instantly
felt relieved. He laughed coldly to himself; it seemed as though the
man was still afraid of the Sword School. However, on the surface he
still didn’t dare to act too arrogantly. No matter how powerful the
Sword School was, it wouldn’t be able to rescue him immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve offended my
Manorlord. You-” Ninefangs started to say, but Ning interrupted
him. “Don’t even bother. Right…the kid said his master is the
Celestial Immortal that is protecting the East Phoenix world. Bring
him over here,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninefangs
nodded, then reached out with his right hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His right hand
instantly pierced through the heavens as he sent it traveling more
than ten thousand kilometers as he made a grabbing motion towards the
Celestial Immortal Patriarch who was within the imperial palace of
the East Phoenix Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the imperial
palace. Celestial Immortal Triscorpion was enjoying life right now,
drinking some wine as he watched beautiful women dancing in front of
him. He was born a monster, but he had entered the Sword School and
eventually been assigned by his own master to stand guard over East
Phoenix world. The main task he had was to protect Mount Dashcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a wonderful
life. I really am blessed, for Master to have sent me here. My other
fellow disciples are preparing to fight against the Seamless Gate.”
Celestial Immortal Triscorpion felt quite delighted with himself. It
was his great fortune to be assigned this task. “And my luck really
isn’t half-bad. After I came to this East Phoenix world, I actually
found a promising young talent. Eastluck’s comprehension abilities
really are quite high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need to
take part in the war, and I even found a good disciple. Excellent,
excellent.” Celestial Immortal Triscorpion beamed merrily as he
stared at the beautiful women before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Triscorpion turned his head, only to see a massive, pitch-black hand
smash through his rooftop and grab him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHH!!”
Triscorpion only had enough time to let out a scream before he was
grabbed and pulled away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dancing beauties
stared blankly at the empty throne, then stared at the massive,
gaping hole in the palace ceiling. They could still visualize that
massive hand of black light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch’s
been seized.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch’s
been captured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of terrified
cries rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh my…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Immortal
cultivators and Diremonsters at Mount Dashcloud stared blankly, heads
raised, at the massive arm that stretched far off into the horizons.
How could an arm stretch that long?! What they didn’t know was that
Ninefangs’ true form was that of a bat. If he was to transform back
into his true form, it would be more than ten thousand kilometers
long. The same was true of Snow Scorpion as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wanted to, he
could stretch his arm out to a length of a hundred thousand
kilometers. And if he was to reach the True God or Daofather
level…well, Daoist Threelives was capable of smashing a major world
with his palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The impossibly long arm
was retracted. The bald old man had seized an Immortal by the collar
with his right hand, and was holding him as easily as he would a
chicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey kid. This your
master?” Ninefangs pointed at the captured Triscorpion.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 14 - One Year
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“M-mas…I…I…”
Prince Eastluck’s eyes bulged out as he began to stammer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastluck?” The
captured Celestial Immortal Triscorpion instantly understood when he
saw the prince. A look of stunned rage appeared in his eyes, then he
hurriedly said, “Senior, senior, this junior is only responsible
for protecting the East Phoenix world. I did not intend to offend the
two of you at all. My master is True Immortal Daoless. Please spare
me, seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord.”
Ninefangs looked towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release him.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then was
Triscorpion allowed to land on the ground. He hurriedly rushed two
steps forward, then delivered a vicious slap against Prince
Eastluck’s face as he roared furiously, “Do you think Mount
Dashcloud is a place for you to cause trouble? Do you think these two
seniors are people you can afford to offend?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He slapped the prince
two more times, then hurriedly turned and smiled ingratiatingly
towards Ning and Ninefangs. “Seniors, when you grabbed me just now,
I was so terrified that I shattered a message talisman. I’m afraid
that my master is going to arrive soon.” He had thought that he was
in mortal danger, but now it seemed as though these two weren’t
planning to act viciously towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master?” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior’s
master is True Immortal Daoless,” Triscorpion said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
“I’ve heard of True Immortal Daoless’s great fame, but I’ve
never met him. It seems I’ll have a chance to meet him today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared in the distance…and with it came a loud, clear laugh.
“This must be the one who slew Immortals and Fiendgods with his
sword as he invincibly dominated the Realmwar…fellow Daoist
Darknorth, yes? How can this junior be worthy of you personally
dealing with him, fellow Daoist Darknorth? You are giving him far too
much face.” This laughter echoed throughout the wild mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invincibly dominated
the Realmwar?” Both Triscorpion and Eastluck were rather dazed. As
for the other cultivators, they were simply puzzled, because they had
no idea what a ‘Realmwar’ even was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced towards
the newcomer. This was a sloppy-looking youth with a big beard who
was flying towards him atop a cloud. His beard was extremely long,
but his face looked very young; it made for an odd contrast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone says that
True Immortal Daoless is uninhibited and unconventional, but in
possession of an absolutely merciless tongue. Today, I’ve seen it
for myself. I admit that I am at fault; I gave a minor punishment to
your disciple,” Ning said with a calm laugh. He had heard long ago
that True Immortal Daoless was a man who said whatever he thought,
and that sometimes his words would offend others. But in turn, his
straightforward, genuine nature made it so that he made some truly
good friends. He was a rather famous figure of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, hey, hey,
that’s not what I meant!” True Immortal Daoless flew over, his
sleeves fluttering. “For a kid like this to be so brazen and
foolish as to offend you? Of course you can kill him if you want!
That’s completely up to you. What I’m saying is, there’s no
need for you to dirty your hands. Just say the word and I’ll do it
for you. Just consider it as me keeping my school clean.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Daoless
reputedly was uninhibited and sloppy, said what he felt, and was
absolutely shameless. It seemed all the stories about him were true.
There really weren’t many Empyrean Gods or True Immortals who would
say such things in front of their own disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doomed. I’m
doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Eastluck just
sat there, completely dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invincibly dominated
the Realmwar? Is he referring to the ‘Realmwars’ which Master
told me about, the ones where countless millions of Immortals will
gather together in a titanic clash? The Realmwars which large numbers
of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals are dying in? This…this
white-robed…he…he was able to invincibly dominate a Realmwar?”
Eastluck was truly dazed now. He couldn’t even comprehend what he
had done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Patriarch
Daoless is so humble before him. Clearly, he’s far more powerful
than Patriarch Daoless…and his subordinate…his subordinate was
able to stretch his arm out for thousands of kilometers to capture a
Celestial Immortal…who is this person?! Why did I have to run into
him? Why am I so damned unlucky?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Eastluck was
filled with terror and regret. But alas…if you often walk by the
riverside, how can you avoid getting your shoes wet? He had grown
accustomed to acting arrogantly, thanks to his status…and today, he
really had rammed into a steel plate. No; a plate of divine
chaos-steel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finished. I’m
finished. I’m dead for sure. Dead for sure.” Prince Eastluck had
gotten used to seeing heads rolling within the imperial palace upon
an important figure being angered. This person before him had a
status that was far, far beyond his own. It would be simplicity
itself for the white-robed youth to crush him to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ji Ning,
Ninefangs, and True Immortal Daoless all soared into the skies,
departing from East Phoenix world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Prince
Eastluck regain his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They…they left?”
Eastluck blinked. “I…didn’t die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” Prince
Eastluck hurriedly looked towards the nearby Celestial Immortal
Triscorpion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Triscorpion glared
daggers at him. “Hmph. If we did as my master Daoless suggested, I
would wipe you out right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe me out?”
Prince Eastluck was horrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, senior
Darknorth interceded on your behalf. He said that you didn’t have
any intentions to kill him. That’s the only reason why you’ve
survived this,” Triscorpion snapped. “But although you shall be
spared the death penalty, that doesn’t mean you’ll go
unpunished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true that I
didn’t intend to kill him,” Prince Eastluck said hurriedly. “I
just wanted to shoo him away. After he crippled my subordinate, I was
furious with him and planned to lock him up and punish him.” Prince
Eastluck wasn’t an evil person by nature. However, because he had
been born into the imperial clan and because of his talent in
cultivation, he had been flattered by others all his life and became
accustomed to acting in an arrogant, high-handed manner. And after he
became a disciple of the Sword School, his status had only risen even
further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simply put, he had
gotten used to bullying others, which is why he had been so stunned
and furious when Ning had crippled his subordinate. How long had it
been since someone else had bullied him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning had revealed
his true power, Eastluck had instantly been so terrified that he
couldn’t stop sweating. Fortunately for him, he hadn’t planned to
kill Ning. If he had, how could Ning possibly not have noticed? If
that was the case, Ning wouldn’t have interceded on his behalf at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master, Daoless,
had been planning on expelling you from the school, but senior
Darknorth instead suggested that you be sent to the mortal world
instead. You are to serve as a junior servant in a winehouse for
three hundred years. During these three hundred years, you are not to
fight back when struck, nor are you to argue when cursed at.”
Triscorpion laughed coldly. “If you disobey, then you will
immediately be expelled from the Sword School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Eastluck finally
let out a sigh of relief. He immediately fell to his knees, then
kowtowed towards the skies. “Thank you, senior Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would indeed be
difficult for him to serve for three centuries as a servant in a
winehouse, and one who could not fight back when struck or argue when
cursed at. But if he was to be expelled from the Sword School…in
the past, he had offended many with his arrogance. If it wasn’t for
his status as a disciple of the Sword School, he probably would’ve
died without a burial spot long ago. No matter what, he was still a
disciple of the Sword School; all he had to do was be tempered within
the red dust of the mortal world for three centuries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple swears
to obey. May the Dao of the Heavens bear witness.” Prince Eastluck
instantly swore an oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. From this day
forth, you are no longer a prince; you were nothing more than an
ordinary mortal servant.” Celestial Immortal Triscorpion flicked
his sleeves. “Come see me in three hundred years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Eastluck immediately left respectfully, then transformed into a
streak of light and flew into the skies by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Triscorpion couldn’t
even be bothered to take a second look at this disciple of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Diremonster by
birth, and possessed of a strange temperament. In the past, he
absolutely doted on Eastluck, but now that Eastluck had caused such a
disaster, resulting in him being captured…Triscorpion focused all
of his resentment on Eastluck. He no longer felt any positive
feelings towards Eastluck at all. If it hadn’t been for the fact
that Ji Ning and Daoless had come to an agreement on Eastluck’s
fate, Triscorpion would’ve expelled that little bastard from the
school already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three centuries.
Hmph.” Triscorpion immediately teleported away and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even after three
centuries, when this disciple came back to see him, he wouldn’t be
in the mood to teach him sincerely. This was because he now detested
this disciple of his. This disciple might be talented, which is why
Triscorpion had previously favored him, but now…he felt repulsed by
him! So what if the kid was talented? How many ‘talented’ figures
would be able to overcome the Celestial Tribulation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…no one
would’ve thought that after this arrogant, wayward Prince Eastluck
spent three centuries as a servant in the mortal world, he would
become modest, low-key, humble, and courteous. He was like a piece of
rough jade that had been carved and polished until it shone with
brilliance. He would overcome his tribulation and become a Celestial
Immortal, then be accepted into the Buddhist Sangha. In fact, during
the final Endwar, he would become a general of the Nuwa Alliance who
would fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning himself would
never have imagined this happening, of course. He crippled the first
guard because he could sense that the guard had planned to kill him.
The prince, however, wasn’t beyond saving. Thus, he devised a path
that he thought would be able to grind away the prince’s arrogance
and pride. That was the extent of his considerations. By now, Ning’s
attention was focused towards his sword-arts and his struggle against
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had planned to stay
on East Phoenix world and train there for three or four months, but
True Immortal Daoless had explained to him that the other twenty-six
worlds only had remnants of the [Five Treasures] sword-arts, whereas
Sword Immortal world had the complete version. In other words, all of
the remnants could be found within Sword Immortal world; there was no
point in wasting time on the other worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still felt that
the other worlds were worth spending some time on, but he decided
that ten days per world was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…he began to
wander through one minor world after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some worlds had
sword-arts left behind on mountain walls. Others had sword-scars left
behind on the wild landscape, in the form of rivers and creeks. Still
others had sword-scars that carved out valleys and gorges within the
forests. These had all been left behind in a casual manner by
Daofather Fuju. Stargold beads in hand, and with Empyrean God
Ninefangs by his side, Ning walked and meditated his way through all
of the minor worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning often made
progress by comparing the nine chaos seals to the sword-arts. He
spent at least three or four days in each world, up to a maximum of
two months at most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he finished
wandering the twenty-sixth world, a full year had passed. Finally,
Ning arrived at the last of the Twenty-Seven Worlds of Fuju. The most
important world…Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There wasn’t a single
mortal within this minor world. At the very center of this minor
world, there were five mountain peaks, each one taller than the last.
The strange thing was, the first peak was a thousand kilometers tall,
the second was two thousand kilometers tall…the pattern continued
all the way to the fifth, which was five thousand kilometers tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a minor world to
have such tall mountains was simply inconceivable! The mountain peaks
stabbed high up into the uppermost layer of clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Five Treasure
Peaks!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninefangs
appeared in the air amidst them. They stared at the five towering
mountain peaks. The majestic aura of might and pressure that swept
out towards them from the mountain peaks caused Ning to feel
startled. Ninefang’s face even turned pale for a moment before he
was able to steady himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
aura. I was caught off-guard and felt a bit nauseous just now.”
Ninefangs said with surprise, “Ordinary Celestial Immortals
probably wouldn’t be able to endure it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could the
mountain peaks that hold the legendary [Five Treasures] sword-art not
be extraordinary? The [Five Treasures] sword-art is the number one
sword-art of the Three Realms,” Ning said with a laugh. “Auras
are invisible and formless; whether or not you can endure an aura is
up to the strength of your Dao-heart. Ninefangs, although Empyrean
Gods don’t have to worry about going insane, the Dao-heart is still
important. You need to work on yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefangs nodded. “Yes,
Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the seven Empyrean
Gods under Ning’s command, Ninefangs had the weakest foundation.
The others had accompanied Daoist Threelives in countless battles
during the Primordial Era, after all. Back then, Ninefangs had merely
been a Void-level Fiendgod. He only made his breakthrough within the
Starseizer world, and he hadn’t experienced many actual battles
afterwards. Given that he also didn’t have a good master to teach
him, he was lacking in many areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number one
sword-art of the Three Realms. I heard that it is incomparably
marvelous.” Ning had heard many legends of the [Five Treasures]
sword-art. Each legend was more fanciful than the last. The more
legends he heard, the more curious Ning became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninefangs went
flying towards the Five Treasure Peaks.

Chapter 15 - Swordforce
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three streaks of light
suddenly flew towards the direction of Ji Ning and Ninefangs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning took a
careful look, instantly recognizing that one of the three was True
Immortal Daoless. He had never seen the other two before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this fellow
Daoist Ji Ning?” A rather ugly-looking man called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard long ago
from junior apprentice-brother Daoless tha fellow Daoist Ji Ning was
going to come here. We’ve been waiting here a long time, but we
were unable to find you. My heart was burning with impatience.” A
handsome youth smiled merrily as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, “I’ve
made the three of you wait so long, fellow Daoists. I’m ashamed,
quite ashamed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We live right here
on Sword Immortal world. We’d still be here even if we weren’t
waiting for you,” the youth laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
“I’ve already met fellow Daoist Daoless. The muscular fellow must
be Empyrean God Hiddenwillow, while this one must be the ‘Sword
Immortal of the Outer Heavens’, fellow Daoist Jimin. I’ve long
heard of fellow Daoist Jimin’s illustrious reputation. Today, I
finally have the chance to meet you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Daofather Fuju
had perished, many of his followers had scattered. These days, the
Sword School only had three Empyrean Gods and True Immortals left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were True Immortal
Daoless, Empyrean God Hiddenwillow, and True Immortal Jimin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Jimin had
been the first to join the school. Empyrean God Hiddenwillow had come
later, while True Immortal Daoless had been the last. True Immortal
Jimin possessed truly extraordinary power. There were only two
individuals in the Three Realms who had mastered the entire [Five
Treasures] sword-art; one was a Daofather, while the other was True
Immortal Jimin. After he mastered it, he instantly rose in power to
become one of the most supreme of True Immortals, on par with the
likes of Lu Dongbin, and so he was reverently titled the ‘Sword
Immortal of the Outer Heavens’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is fellow
Daoist Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth actually arrived as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard of fellow
Daoist Darknorth’s exploits in the Crimsonbright Realmwar. He used
his sword to suppress a Daofather golem…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, one voice
after another began to ring out as more streaks of light flew towards
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Daoless
hurriedly explained, “These are the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals who are at Sword Immortal world to study the [Five
Treasures] sword-art. They naturally are on our side as well. Prior
to the storm arriving, Sword Immortal world usually saw thousands of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals gathering here, with the occasional
Daofather as well. However, now that the storm has arrived, and given
that many of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Three Realms
have already visited this place, there are now very few people here.
Aside from the three of us and the two of you, fellow Daoist Ji Ning,
there are thirty-nine other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
currently present.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These individuals all
belonged to the Nuwa Alliance, and they all knew of Ning. Naturally,
they held Ning in high esteem. There were very, very few people who
could have an impact on a Realmwar the way Ning did, after all. Even
the likes of Redsnow had to join forces with the rest of the seven
Empyrean Gods in order to possess such tremendous power. Given that
Ning was able to match a Daofather golem in might just by commanding
a million Immortals…which Empyrean God or True Immortal would dare
treat him with discourtesy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even supreme Sword
Immortals like True Immortal Jimin, who had mastered the [Five
Treasures] sword-art, treated Ning with great courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for some
time, everyone went their separate ways. They were all here to train
in sword-arts, after all; this was what truly mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some other
fellow Daoists who you haven’t met yet; they should still be busy
with their meditations,” True Immortal Jimin said with a laugh. The
three leaders of the Sword School accompanied Ji Ning and Ninefangs
as they flew forward on a cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “I can already see them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was able to see the
five towering peaks in the distance. The peaks, the valleys, the
distant mountain lakes…there were Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
seated in the lotus position throughout the five peaks. All of them
were rather casually spread out, and normally none of them would
bother each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That one over there
is fellow Daoist Jadesky,” True Immortal Jimin said as he pointed
to the first mountain peak, where a black-robed man was seated atop a
giant boulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That one over there
is fellow Daoist Icefeather.” He pointed to a barely-visible
white-robed youth that was seated in the lotus position deep within a
mountain cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were seated
in the lotus position, as unmoving as boulders. It was hard to tell
how long they had been there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of them have
given up everything to focus on the [Five Treasures] sword-art,”
True Immortal Jimin said with a sigh. “The others are at most
observing and studying. They’ll occasionally gain an insight, but
they aren’t truly training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given up
everything?” Ning was surprised. “Can it be that the [Five
Treasures] sword-art really is as terrifying as the legends say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby True
Immortal Daoless chuckled. “Some legends are exaggerated, but other
legends don’t go far enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Both Ning and
Ninefangs listened attentively. The legends regarding the [Five
Treasures] sword-art were quite fanciful. Supposedly, not even
Daofathers would dare to casually train in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Five Treasures]
sword-art is indeed incomparably marvelous and mysterious,” True
Immortal Daoless laughed. “It is completely different from any
other sword-art of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
noticed this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Other sword-arts are
founded upon the Heavenly Daos, but the [Five Treasures] sword-art
walks a different path,” True Immortal Daoless said. “If you just
train as though you are dipping a toe into the water to test the
temperature…you’ll at most gain an occasional bit of insight. If,
however, you start your training from the very first chapter of the
[Five Treasures] sword-art…then some of the things described in the
legends will occur.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Daoless
said softly, “All the other Daos you have gained insight
into…Heavenly Daos, Grand Daos, ordinary Daos…you will slowly
begin to forget them. They will completely vanish from your
memories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more you train
in the [Five Treasures] sword-art, the more of the other Daos you
will forget.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you beginning
training in the third chapter of the [Five Treasures] sword-art,
aside from the Dao of the Sword, you will forget all other Daos!”
True Immortal Jimin looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly. “So
that’s how it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby True
Immortal Jimin said, “The [Five Treasures] sword-art has four
chapters. The first chapter is recorded on the walls of the first
mountain. The second chapter is on the second mountain, and the third
chapter is on the third mountain. The final, fourth chapter is
naturally on the fourth mountain. As for the fifth mountain…my
master, Daofather Fuju, used to live there when he was alive. It
holds a minor cavern-estate within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you begin
training in the first chapter, your insights into all other Daos
shall be affected; slowly, they’ll begin to recede. The deeper your
insights into the [Five Treasures] sword-art becomes, the more
insights into the other Daos you shall lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you finish the
third chapter, all other Daos shall be lost. The only path remaining
is the Dao of the Sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth chapter
is the most difficult chapter of all. The most terrifying outcome…is
that you will master the third chapter, but be unable to master the
fourth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you master the
fourth chapter, you’ll have mastered the entire [Five Treasures]
sword-art, and you’ll truly understand how marvelous and divine
this sword-art is.” True Immortal Jimin sighed with feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
“Training in the [Five Treasures] sword-art will cause your
insights into the other Daos to be lost? Is it possible to retrain
and regain them after losing them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s possible,
but…” True Immortal shook his head. “When you begin training in
the other Daos, you’ll begin to gradually lose your insights into
the [Five Treasures] sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, you have a
choice; either train in the various other Daos or only train in the
[Five Treasures] sword-art.” True Immortal Jimin chuckled. “But
of course, if you completely master the entire [Five Treasures]
sword-art, it’ll be completely memorized as a perfect whole within
your mind. You can begin to train in other Daos once more, and by
then you will no longer be impacted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Empyrean God
Hiddenwillow interjected, “But the fourth chapter is far too
difficult. To master the first chapter, you have to have at least
reached the first stage of swordforce. As for the second chapter,
you’ll need to have reached the second stage of swordforce. In
turn, mastering the fourth chapte requires you to have at least
reached the fourth stage of swordforce…and that’s just a
prerequisite! Even if you have reached that level, you still might be
unable to succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
heard these stories before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the [Five
Treasures] sword-art truly was too powerful. After mastering it, the
speed of one’s sword would exceed the limitations of the Heavenly
Daos themselves! True Immortal Jimin, for example, was one of the
most supreme True Immortals of the Three Realms. Once he broke
through to become a Daofather, he would immediately become a supreme
one thanks to his [Five Treasures] sword-art, even though his other
insights were comparatively inferior to those of the other
Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
speed of his sword would be faster than anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
the [Five Treasures] sword-art was so alluring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you master the
entire [Five Treasures] sword-art, you’ll be able to enter the
cavern-estate in the fifth peak which Master left behind.” True
Immortal Jimin pointed towards the distant, tallest peak. “Master
died in the primordial chaos, but before he entered it, he gave us
certain instructions. He said that if something unexpected happened
to him, we were to make the [Five Treasures] sword-art available to
the public. Any Fiendgod Body Refiner who has mastered the [Five
Treasures] sword-art can enter his cavern-estate and receive his most
important legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the countless
years that have passed since Master died, unfathomable numbers of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals have come here to meditate. Even
True Gods and Daofathers have come here! However, very, very few are
willing to give up all their insights into the other Daos and focus
solely on the Dao of the Sword! This is especially true for Ki
Refiners. Once they lose their insights into the Dao, they’ll be
unable to control the Immortal energy within their bodies. They’ll
begin to go insane and die from the deviant energies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ki Refiner
Daofathers, for example; they are Daofathers because they have
mastered a Heavenly Dao. But what if they forgot that Heavenly Dao?
Given how utterly enormous the Great Firmament energy in their bodies
are, once they forgot their Daos, they would be completely unable to
control that energy. It would deviate and possibly even detonate,
causing their souls to be shattered and destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, amongst Ki
Refiners, only Sword Immortals can train in this sword-art, and they
have to at least be at the Pure Yang True Immortal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for Fiendgods?
It’s true that they can train in it without having to worry about
their energy deviating. But the exalted True Gods…most of them have
trained for countless years and have extremely deep insights into the
Dao. How many of them are willing to give up all of their insights?
From the Primordial Era to the modern era, there have been only a
total of three True Gods who have truly come here to train in the
[Five Treasures] sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, Fiendgods
by nature are weaker when it comes to comprehension abilities. Those
three True Gods in particular were not exceptionally talented with
regards to the Dao of the Sword. It is hard to force your way into
getting insights, and so in the end they all gave up,” True
Immortal Jimin said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, those three
True Gods were some of the weakest amongst their peers, which was why
they had been willing to discard everything to train in this art!
They had thought that if they gained this astonishing sword-art which
allowed the speed of their swords to surpass the limits of the Dao of
the Heavens, they would instantly become some of the most powerful
True Gods alive. But alas, they had no talent in this field, and so
it was too difficult for them to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take Ji Ning as an
example. He was able to advance very rapidly in the Dao of the Sword,
but if he trained to train in the Grand Dao of Time? He would most
likely progress at an unbearably slow rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two who truly
succeeded in mastering it were both Ki Refiners. I am one of them.
The other is Daofather Holyflame. Because both of us are Ki Refiners,
neither of us were able to receive Master’s legacy. However,
Daofather Holyflame can now be considered the number one Sword
Immortal of the Three Realms,” True Immortal Jimin said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Holyflame had
grown up in a peculiar way. His mother had been a Celestial Immortal
known as Princess Iron Fan, while his father had been an Empyrean God
known as the Bull Demon King, one of the Seven Great Diremonster
Saints of the Primordial Era. Daofather Holyflame had been born with
tremendous talent in fire, and had thus been known as the ‘Red
Boy’. Thanks to his incredible talent, he had smoothly sailed
through his cultivation to become a Celestial Immortal, and the
samadhi truefire he nourished in his body was especially powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, he became
apprenticed to the Buddhist Guanyin and became her follower. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eventually, the
Primordial Era ended and the Three Realms were born. He ended up
breaking through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal. After Daofather
Fuju died, he came to meditate on the [Five Treasures] sword-art, and
he was absolutely crazy in his training. Buddhism? His parents? He
discarded and forgot about all such things…and he actually managed
to succeed in one go! After he mastered the [Five Treasures]
sword-art, his power and status instantly skyrocketed. He then spent
centuries to painstakingly regain the Grand Daos which he had
forgotten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than thirty
thousand years after he mastered the [Five Treasures] sword-art, he
mastered the Heavenly Dao of Fire and became a Daofather. After that,
he became known by the exalted title of Daofather Holyflame!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He personally welcomed
his mother Iron Fan back home, but he didn’t pay much attention to
the Bull Demon King. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, his sword
had become the fastest sword of all the Three Realms! Many Immortals
and Fiendgods believed him to be the number one Sword Immortal of the
Three Realms. However, Daofather Holyflame’s foundation was a bit
weak, as he had only mastered a single Heavenly Dao, the Heavenly Dao
of Fire! Even his swordforce was merely at the fourth stage, and he
had yet to reach the fifth stage. Thus, not everyone agreed that he
was the number one Sword Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, however, he
was one of the most supreme Daofathers around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who were more
powerful than him during the Primordial Era now had to treat him with
reverence. This was one of the marvels of time. Perhaps, in the
future…a young fellow who was currently weak would end up becoming
so powerful that Holyflame himself would have to treat him with
reverence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You now know about
all the pros and cons of the [Five Elements] sword-art.” True
Immortal Jimin looked towards Ning. “It’s up to you whether you
wish to train in it or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had heard these
legends long ago; the only difference today made was that he now knew
a bit more than he had in the past. In truth, the year he had spent
on the other worlds was a testament to Ning’s decision! He was
going to embark on the path of the Sword Immortal, and that path
alone! For the sake of the [Five Treasures] sword-art, Ning had long
ago decided to give up his insights into the Grand Dao of the
Waterdrop and the other Daos. Right now, the reason he was powerful
was because of his heartforce and his divine abilities, such as the
[Starseizing Hand] and the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]! He wouldn’t
forget any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only things he
would forget were his insights into the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t disturb
you any further.” True Immortal Jimin and the other two immediately
left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefangs, I’m
going to go take a look at the [Five Treasures] sword-art. If there’s
nothing urgent, don’t interrupt me,” Ning said. Ninefangs
hurriedly assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew far into the
distance, heading towards the first chapter of the [Five Treasures]
sword-art.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 16 - Training In Solitude
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Treasure Peaks
were ancient beyond belief. A complete version of the number one
sword-art of the Three Realms, the [Five Treasures] sword-art, had
been left behind on them, giving them an aura of being even more
exalted than the Dao of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura and presence
emanating from the Five Treasure Peaks was enough to ensure that
neither birds nor bugs could survive here. The only living creatures
here were the forty-plus Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, but given
how vast the Five Treasure Peaks were, the cultivators weren’t
particularly eye-catching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is rare to
find such a quiet place.” Ji Ning landed, then stood there upon the
wilderness, head raised as he stared at the criss-crossing sword
stances that had been left atop the distant mountain cliffs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning’s
heart clenched as a series of sword techniques began to flood into
his brain. This sword-art was ancient, profound, and beyond the
Heavenly Daos themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly inconceivable.
How could such a divine sword-art exist in the world?” Ning was
only able to recover after a long period of time had passed. A cloud
appeared beneath his feet as he began to slowly fly upwards. The
first peak was a thousand kilometers high, and so it naturally
pierced far up into the clouds. As for the first chapter of the [Five
Treasures] sword-art, it covered more than half of the mountain walls
of the first peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to view
the sword-art as he flew upwards, and various sword stances began to
flash past his eyes. Ning viewed them very slowly, taking a full hour
before finishing his viewing of the first chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first chapter is
truly as vast as an ocean.” Ning sighed in amazement. This was
definitely the most complicated sword-art he had ever seen; just the
first chapter alone contained a total of 3729 different stances, each
one incomparably marvelous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning
transformed into a streak of light, charging back downwards. As he
landed on the ground, he pointed off into the distance. Instantly,
the power of Heaven and Earth began to activate, quickly causing an
ordinary thatched cottage to take form. Ning stepped into it, then
sat down into the lotus position. He faced the Five Treasure Peaks,
then closed his eyes and began to think back to what he had seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword stances began
to replay through his mind as he began to attempt to fathom them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew what his
advantages were and what his disadvantages were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been
tremendously lucky, as he had the chance to learn divine abilities
like the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and the [Starseizing Hand]; these
two divine abilities were already enough to allow him to stand at the
very peak of power for Empyrean Gods! But his goal wasn’t to be a
powerful Empyrean God…it was to become a True God and a Daofather!
During the final Endwar, one had to have the power of a True God or a
Daofather in order to be of use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, he had to
become a supremely powerful True God and Daofather. In fact, he
wanted to try to work hard to reach the level of the leaders of the
Daoist Path and the Buddhist Sangha…or even the level of Nuwa and
Pangu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how was he supposed
to reach this level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that compared to the other major powers, his greatest weakness was
that he hadn’t trained for very long. This was a tremendous
disadvantage. The storm had already begun to press down upon them,
and the final, terrifying explosion wouldn’t be too far off. He
didn’t actually have that much time. If he wanted to take things
step-by-step, first mastering the various Grand Daos and then slowly
work on the Heavenly Dao of Water, then the rest of the Five Elements
so as to reach the level of Lord Buddha or Daoist Three
Purities…without question, it would take an unfathomable amount of
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t have enough
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What could he do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His only choice was to
make a lateral thrust, to make an unconventional gambit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His greatest talent
currently lay in heartforce. The heart was an invisible, formless
thing, but it was possible to make great breakthroughs in it. Right
now, Ning had already reached the fourth stage in heartforce! If he
was to reach the fifth stage, he would instantly be comparable to the
most supreme of Daofathers. Long ago, Houyi had reached the fifth
stage of heartforce as an Empyrean God and thus became capable of
killing True Gods and Daofathers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Master Subhuti believed
that Ning’s talent with the sword was even greater than his talent
in heartforce. Supposedly, if swordforce reached the fifth stage, it
would be no weaker than heartforce of the fifth stage. But how was he
to reach such a level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The best choice was to
train in the number one sword-art of the Three Realms, the [Five
Treasures] sword-art! The [Five Treasures] sword-art was even capable
of allowing the speed of his sword to exceed the limitations of the
Heavenly Daos; it would definitely allow him to be the most powerful
figure amongst his peers. Even if his peers also mastered fifth stage
swordforce, if he mastered the [Five Treasures] sword-art, he would
still be far more powerful than them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll walk these
two paths simultaneously. So long as one of them succeeds…I, Ji
Ning, will stand at the very peak of the Three Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that both paths were extremely difficult paths to walk…but if you
wanted to stand at the top, how could you avoid taking a difficult
path? Others wouldn’t even have the chance to make an attempt like
this. Ning had both the chance and the necessarily talent…of course
he had to go all-out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not just for himself;
it was also for his family, for his loved ones. If he didn’t have
enough power, not only would he be doomed, even Brightmoon and the
others would find it hard to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely
subsumed himself into his training. Every so often, he would leave
the thatched cottage to take another look at the first chapter of the
[Five Treasures] sword-art. Although he had already memorized it all,
the sword stances on the cliff had been personally left behind by
Daofather Fuju, and it contained Fuju’s sword-intent. Ning was able
to memorize the stances, but he wasn’t able to memorize the
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason
why, in times of peace, thousands of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
would come here to cultivate, with each cultivation session often
lasting a million years or even longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Five
Treasure Peaks were completely silent. All of the Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were as silent as deadwood, completely focused on the
sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao…is
slipping away…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was vanishing
from his mind, one strand at a time. No matter how hard Ning tried to
recollect those memories, he was unable to do so. They had truly been
lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue.” Ning
shut his eyes, continuing his meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he lost his other
Daos, he lost them. For the sake of the sword…it would all be worth
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Losing the other Daos
represented that Ning was continuously progressing in his
understanding of the [Five Treasures] sword-art. Ning also had the
nine chaos seals to meditate over as well. As time passed and as his
insights deepened, Ning began to realize that the nine chaos seals
were even more profound and even more difficult to fathom. By
comparison, the 3729 sword stances of the first chapter of the [Five
Treasures] sword-art were simply meant to familiarize Ning with a
system that was different from all other sword-arts, a system that
transcended the Heavenly Daos themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Five Treasures]
sword-art was more detailed, but its power was also a bit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense, truth be
told. The nine chaos seals…not even Daoist Three Purities or Mother
Nuwa (prior to the destruction of the Primordial Era) had been able
to completely master them. The [Five Treasures] sword-art, however,
had been created by Daofather Fuju.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just by comparing them,
it was clear which one was superior. However, both transcended the
Dao of the Heavens, and so they could be compared to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…I’ve
lost the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop.” Midway through his training,
Ning suddenly could sense that his Grand Dao of the Waterdrop was no
longer perfect and complete. He paused for a moment…but then he
once more began to calmly continue his meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao continued to
leak away from him in tiny strands…but his understanding of the
[Five Treasures] sword-art grew increasingly refined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five treasures…five
treasures…” Ning rose to his feet, walking out of the thatched
cottage. He raised his head to stare at the distant first peak, then
sighed softly to himself. “It truly is a treasure. Only when you
truly begin to train in it will you understand how vast and marvelous
it is. I really have no idea how Daofather Fuju could’ve developed
such an unfathomably powerful sword-art in the past. How could a
major power like him have perished in such a silent, noiseless
manner?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju’s
death was a mystery. He was so formidable…how could he have
perished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it that before
he went into the primordial chaos, he intentionally left behind his
legacy within the fifth peak? It was as though he knew that there was
a chance he would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did he encounter
Outsiders in the primordial chaos who killed him? Or did he encounter
a mysterious, dangerous area within the infinite primordial chaos
which he had to enter despite the danger?” Ning was unable to come
up with the answer, and so he stopped guessing. The primordial chaos
was simply too vast and mysterious. The nine chaos seals themselves
had come from the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Training in the
first chapter alone has made my sword far faster than it was in the
past.” Ning had already mastered the first chapter of the [Five
Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first chapter
wasn’t that difficult; the majority of those who were truly
determined to train in it would succeed in their efforts. But of
course, one had to have at least reached the first stage of
swordforce to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Darknorth sword
emerged, appearing in Ning’s hands. He began to execute the
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t use any of
his Immortal energy or his divine power. He was like an ordinary
mortal training with the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chopping…piercing…slashing…deflecting…these
were the most basic of sword stances, but in Ning’s hands they
seemed to flow together like water. As Ning continued with his
swordplay, a layer of white-gold light began to appear atop his
sword. The dazzling, white-gold halo caused his sword to possess
inconceivable might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made his sword
faster. Sharper. Even space itself began to crackle and tear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the second
stage of swordforce…the ‘Dazzling Sun’ stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stage of
swordforce was known as the ‘Silver Moon’ stage, because at this
stage a layer of silvery-white light would appear atop the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So, without even
realizing it, I’ve already reached the second stage of swordforce.”
Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Daoist
monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti sat there with
his eyes closed. In truth, he was watching over the entire Three
Realms. The Three Realms were currently in a state of chaos; as the
most accomplished expert of the Three Realms in the art of spacetime,
Subhuti would naturally keep an eye on all places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Subhuti
opened his eyes, a trace of a smile within them. “This disciple of
mine has actually reached the second stage of swordforce. Mmm…I
imagine that he’s probably calmed down by now. It’s time to let
him exchange blows with the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Subhuti’s
abilities, he had long ago found some suitable headquarters of the
Seamless Gate for Ji Ning to act against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…if he always
let Ji Ning attack so furiously, Ji Ning would probably die in his
fury. Thus, Subhuti wanted to ensure that he was in control of the
general tempo of things. He wouldn’t let Ji Ning get involved in an
excessive slaughter, but he had to allow Ji Ning to reach his goal of
forcing the Seamless Gate to bow its head. Thus…Subhuti needed to
handle things with precision.

Chapter 17 - The Five Monarchs
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering Five
Treasures Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was staring at
the sword stances engraved upon the mountainside of the first peak,
sensing the sword-intent radiating from it. Suddenly, the space
around him turned blurry as an old man in Daoist robes suddenly
manifested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
immediately called out respectfully upon seeing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Work hard to learn
the [Five Treasures] sword-art. If you master it, you’ll have a
greater chance to survive this storm,” Subhuti said with a laugh.
“Now…prior to this, you said you wish to act against the Seamless
Gate, I believe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
He nodded repeatedly. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
spread across the Three Realms. Some worlds have more experts, some
worlds have fewer.” Subhuti continued, “Realms such as the one
Crimsonbright ruled over are comparatively weak. Your homeland, the
Grand Xia, for example; prior to the Seamless Gate’s actions, there
were almost no Empyrean Gods or True Immortals within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded repeatedly.
“Master, I want to go to the major worlds of supreme powers.
Killing Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals won’t affect the
Seamless Gate that much, unless I kill an absolutely enormous amount
of them. I’m going to be launching sneak attacks; there’s not
going to be enough time for me to kill that many of them. That’s
why I want to primarily focus on Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the deaths of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would cause heartache for the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Three
Realms…the strongest force on our side is that of the human race,”
Subhuti said. “The human race is led by the Three Emperors of
Mankind: Suiren, Fuxi, and Shennong. The three of them are on the
same level as the leaders of the Daoist Path and Buddhist Sangha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second to them are
the Five Monarchs. These five Monarchs were all former rulers of the
human race. The final one, Xia Yu, completely unified all humans
under his rule; only then did they all become true rulers. Ever since
then, the Primordial Imperial Clan which rules the human race has
been led by the Xia clan.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that during the
Primordial Era, Xia Yu had tamed the floods with his divine
abilities, blessing the lands with kindness and benevolence. Even the
Three Emperors acknowledged him and supported him, causing his rule
to become even more stable and firm. And of course, Xia Yu himself
possessed tremendous power. How could someone be considered a
‘Monarch’ of the human race be weak? Even Ning’s own senior
apprentice-brother, Sun Wukong, had acquired the golden staff he used
from Xia Yu, who had made it for him. 2”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, in terms of
major worlds…the major worlds which are controlled by the
Primordial Imperial Clan are all extremely powerful. The Seamless
Gate has stationed many troops in those worlds, and the battles
between the experts there are all incredibly savage. If you attack,
the Seamless Gate will immediately send their vast armies to tie you
down. I recommend that you do not go there,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. The
battlegrounds between the Primordial Imperial Clan and the Seamless
Gate were some of the most terrifying places of the entire Three
Realms. Both sides had concentrated enormous amounts of power there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The realms ruled
over by the other four Monarchs, however, are comparatively much
weaker. But of course, they are still much stronger than the
Crimsonbright Realm,” Subhuti said. “Which of the realms ruled
over by the other four Monarchs would you like to go to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which one? Any one
of them works,” Ning said hurriedly. He just wanted to kill the
Seamless Gate’s people. The location didn’t really matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the major
worlds under Monarch Zhuanxu, the Winterherald world, holds
Youngflame Freak within it. He has a total of eighteen clones spread
throughout the Three Realms, with sixteen of them being within the
Winterherald world,” Subhuti said. Although Youngflame Freak’s
life-preserving methods were formidable, they were nothing to
Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
“Does the Winterherald world have many Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although war has yet
to come to the Winterherald world, the Seamless Gate has a total of
nine Empyrean Gods and True Immortals already stationed there,”
Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monarch Zhuanxu was one
of the Five Monarchs who had once ruled over the human race.
Naturally, he had many powerful human experts following him. He
himself was also exceedingly powerful, and in truth, the ‘Kindwater’
3 clan was a branch of Zhuanxu’s clan. But of course, the Kindwater
clan was on a lower level than the Xiamang clan, much like how
Monarch Zhuanxu was on a lower level than Monarch Xia Yu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals…fine. I choose this world.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a map of the
forces of the Seamless Gate that are spread throughout the entire
Zhuanxu Realm.” Subhuti handed over a furled scroll to Ning, then
instructed, “But you must not tarry overlong in each battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and look at
it, then destroy it,” Subhuti instructed. Ning immediately opened
up and began to memorize the contents of the scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scroll had very
detailed notes regarding the disposition of forces of both sides
across the thirty-nine major worlds of the Zhuanxu Realm. The
locations of the sixteen clones of Youngflame Freak were all marked
out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning flared the
divine power in his hands, reducing the scroll to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Subhuti
nodded, then disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of a killing
intent flashed past Ning’s eyes. “The time has finally come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefangs.” Ning’s
form blurred momentarily, then he appeared next to Ninefangs, who was
napping next to a nearby thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord.”
Ninefangs hurriedly woke up and rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go back to the
Starseizer world for now,” Ning instructed, “And carry out the
plan as we previously discussed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefangs instantly
understood what Ning was planning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ninefangs
said respectfully. He then allowed Ning to pull him directly into the
Starseizer world. By now, after Ning had completely mastered and
bound the Starseizing Manor, Ning realized that the Starseizer world
was actually hidden within a special region of the Starseizing Manor.
Mother Nuwa had actually created the Starseizer world in that region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was now completely
capable of drawing others straight into the Starseizer world or
teleporting people out from it. There was no need to go through the
Starseizing Manor first, though of course this was only possible
because he had already fully bound it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zhuanxu Realm. The
Winterherald major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterherald was the
world where the great army which Monarch Zhuanxu had once used to
unify the human race, the Winterherald Army, was stationed. The
various matters of the Winterherald world were all decided upon by
the general and the deputy general of the army. Normally, this was
quite a peaceful world, but ever since the Seamless Gate had begun to
infiltrate it, a large number of minor clashes had begun to erupt,
causing the Winterherald world to become rather chaotic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all
small-scale battles. They were still far away from launching the
campaign against this major world, to say nothing of launching a
Realmwar. A war against Monarch Zhuanxu, one of the Five Monarchs of
the Primordial Imperial Clan, would definitely come towards the very
end of the campaign against the three thousand major worlds. The only
thing the Seamless Gate was doing right now was tying down his
forces, preventing him from being able to easily reinforce the other
Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really is a
different place.” Ning stood atop a mountain peak, staring at the
vast world. His heartforce had spread out to cover it long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce, ephemeral
and invisible…one had to reach the fourth stage to be able to cover
an entire world with it. Most importantly of all, there was almost no
way to sense someone else’s heartforce, as it was completely
traceless; the only possible way was to possess heartforce on the
same level. For example, when Ning had made his breakthrough on the
Grand Xia, he had unconsciously spread his heartforce out to cover
the entire Grand Xia without Daofather Ink Bamboo or Daofather
Crimsonbright noticing it. This was because, although they were born
as a True God and a True Fiend of tremendous power, they weren’t
particularly strong in heartforce. Neither had reached the fourth
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan and some
of the supreme major powers, in turn, had only reached the fourth
stage of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Houyi had ever
reached the fifth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, the Godking
of the Seamless Gate would’ve been able to notice that Ning had
spread his heartforce out, but the Godking had been in the Fifth
World, not the Grand Xia. He was able to watch the battle and
mentally converse with Daofather Ink Bamboo through sending his
coresense out through the Void and into the Grand Xia, but coresense
alone wouldn’t be able to discover heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Winterherald
world is actually very tightly governed and ruled. The Celestial
Immortals and Fiendgods are all arranged into armies,” Ning sighed
internally. “The Grand Xia only formed Immortal armies when forced
to do so, but the army of Monarch Zhuanxu has existed since the
Primordial Era. I imagine that their teamwork is far superior as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. First, I’ll
go wipe out the sixteen clones of Youngflame Freak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Freak
truly is a cautious fellow. On the surface, he appears to be
accompanying Azurefox in the Crimsonbright Realm, but his other
bodies were squirreled away here at the Zhuanxu Realm.” Ning’s
body transformed as he used the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], instantly
becoming a bit taller. He now had the aura of a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disappeared into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Winterherald world.
The Seamless Gate had three headquarters here, each of which had
three Empyrean Gods and True Immortals guarding over them, along with
many Immortals and layers of formations. Even if the experts of the
Winterherald world assaulted them, they would be able to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from these three
headquarters, there were also 182 bases spread throughout the world.
These bases could be withdrawn or abandoned at a moment’s notice,
or be used to launch sneak attacks when needed. They were more than
enough to create chaos throughout the Winterherald world. To the
Winterherald world, however, these bases were like ants that would
occasionally give them a bite. But if they were to actually attack
those bases…given the Seamless Gate’s intelligence abilities, the
bases would be instantly evacuated. And, most importantly of all,
those bases were so weak that they weren’t really worth
annihilating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Yeah, yeah.
Keep on killing. So many of us died during the Crimsonbright
Realmwar, and now you want us to go kill others?” An ugly old man
was eating some meat, a cold light in his eyes. “Still, I don’t
really mind. Even if I lose another one of my clone, I’ll still
have my sixteen clones hiding here safe and sound.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Zhuanxu Realm…I
imagine that the war will only come here at the very end. That’s
going to be quite some time from now. When it comes, I’ll slink off
to a different Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two alliances were
battling each other, and there was nowhere for the Celestial
Immortals to run. He had to have a ‘legal’ status somewhere. The
Crimsonbright Realm was very far away from the Zhuanxu Realm. Given
that Youngflame Freak had been very low-key in the Grand Xia, there
had only been a very low number of Celestial Immortals who had ever
seen him. His clones in the Winterherald world were similarly
low-key, and the number of Celestial Immortals who encountered him
was similarly low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only someone who had
previously met him in person before would be able to tell that these
were his clones! But clearly, Youngflame Freak hadn’t been that
unlucky thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been hidden for
countless years with the false identity of ‘Immortal Bloodfiend’.
This was a publicly acknowledged persona, and no one suspected that
there was a connection between ‘Immortal Bloodfiend’ and
‘Youngflame Freak’. Now that he had joined the Seamless Gate and
had been inserted here, he was quite low-key.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak was
very famous, but only had two clones; one public, one hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Bloodfiend was
almost unknown. He had one public clone and fifteen hidden ones for a
total of sixteen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This storm is
supposedly going to be a very dangerous one, but perhaps I’ll be
able to survive yet again. Hmph, of what use is power? Staying alive
is what matters. Ji Ning? I can’t be bothered to deal with you. You
have already displayed your brilliance and your sharpness…now,
let’s see if you’ll be able to survive the storm.” Youngflame
Freak munched on his meat and guzzled his wine in a very relaxed
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not going to
go too crazy in defending this base. Some of the other bases are much
more brash than me; the Winterherald world will go after them first,
not me. However, my base isn’t a weak one either; the Seamless Gate
will have no grounds to blame me. How pleasant.” When he thought
about how the other Immortals and Fiendgods were risking their lives,
and how many had died in the Realmwar, Youngflame Freak felt even
more self-satisfied at how clever he was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Staying alive is
what really matt-” Youngflame Freak’s face suddenly changed. “An
enemy’s attacking? Wait, that doesn’t make sense. There shouldn’t
be any attacks against me.” Youngflame Freak immediately flew out,
having no time to worry about anything else.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a fairly small

Youngflame Freak. It was similar to the Myriad Demons Cavern base
which Ning had rescued Mu Northson out of; that place also had just a
single Celestial Immortal within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was on purpose.
The relative weakness of each base made it easier for them to
relocate as necessary, without paying much of a price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were groups of
roving guards within the base, as well as some black-robed figures in
the distance. The black-robed figures all had auras at the Loose
Immortal or Earth Immortal level. For ordinary Immortal cultivators,
a place like this was an absolute devil’s den…but to Ji Ning,
this place normally wouldn’t be worth his time at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His target was the
guardian of this base…Youngflame Freak!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An enemy has barged
in!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a Celestial
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surround and attack
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The base was tightly
guarded, and as soon as Ning used a Greater Teleportation to bypass
the formations, he was instantly discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The group
of black-robed figures instantly set up a great formation, beginning
to attack Ning en masse. All of them were Loose Immortals, and some
of them were comparable in power to Loose Immortals who had survived
for a million years. If they joined forces, they were absolutely
capable of battling a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately for
you, I’m not a Celestial Immortal,” Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A giant flag
appeared in Ning’s hands, brimming with menace. This flag was a
transformation of one of the Thirty-Six Heavens created by the 3600
stargold beads. This Protocosmic spirit-treasure could change form at
well, and it possessed tremendous power; Ning enjoyed using it very
much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie him down! Once
Immortal Bloodfiend arrives, he’ll be dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Immortal
Bloodfiend is incredibly powerful; no ordinary Celestial Immortal can
match him. Tie him down!” The black-robed figures were all valiant
and fearless. They formed together into an enormous black dragon,
attempting to tie Ning down for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held up the giant
flag, pointing the tip of the flagpole towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such hollow,
meaningless attacks.” Ning stood there in the air, moving
lightning-fast as he charged into the base. The flag in his hands
swept outwards like an Immortal sword, causing golden light to appear
in the skies. As for the black-robed figures who were in formation?
Every single one of their chests was pierced straight through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning advanced, the
flag in his hands stabbed through the chests of nine of the
black-robed figures. They were crushed like ants, all nine of them
dying on the spot. The great formation was instantly dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dares to barge
into the forbidden grounds?!” An ugly old man charged out with a
hideous roar, surrounded by the stench of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding guards
felt as though their savior had come. They all called out hurriedly
towards him. They had been utterly terrified just now; the only
reason they had dared to battle Ning was because they had a
formation, but even the formation was useless against him. Faced with
such a supremely powerful ‘Celestial Immortal’, they no longer
dared to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Name yourself!”
The ugly old man said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair, staring at the ugly old man. He recognized him as Youngflame
Freak right away; he had personally seen Youngflame Freak before,
after all. Ning laughed coldly, then said angrily, “The Seamless
Gate killed my loved ones. Now that my power has increased, I’m
going to wipe you all out! If I find one, I’ll kill one; if I find
two, I’ll kill a pair. I’ll make the Seamless Gate regret what it
did!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All by yourself?”
The ugly old man snickered. “The Seamless Gate isn’t something
the likes of you can offend. I urge you to leave right away.
Otherwise…don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave? In your
dreams!” Ning charged straight towards Youngflame Freak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart,
Youngflame Freak was cursing to himself. “What horrible luck. I
actually ran into a madman who wants revenge. The Seamless Gate has
harmed countless people throughout the Three Realms; there are far,
far too many people with grudges against it. This is a Celestial
Immortal who I’ve never even seen before. He must’ve been harmed
by the Seamless Gate in the past. Now that he’s broken through to
become a Celestial Immortal, he’s gone mad for revenge. There are
so many bases in the Winterherald world…why the hell did he have to
choose mine? What horrible luck!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt extremely
unhappy, but since his foe was already attacking, Youngflame Freak
didn’t dare to take him lightly. He produced a blood-colored
horsetail whisk in his hand, then swept the whisk forward,
transforming it into three thousand blood serpents that surged
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The giant flag
in Ning’s hands fluttered. The flagpole was still merely as thick
as a palm, but suddenly it expanded to become three thousand meters
long. It struck out lightning-fast, stabbing straight into Youngflame
Freak’s chest with a piercing sound! As for those three thousand
blood serpents…how could they possibly stop the might of this
‘Banner of the Heavens’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…”
Youngflame Freak’s eyes bulged out as he stared towards Ning in
disbelief. His heart was filled with utter rage. “He’s close to a
Pure Yang True Immortal in power? He absolutely is extremely close to
that level. Why is my luck so horrible! A random attacking Celestial
Immortal ends up having close to the power of a Pure Yang True
Immortal. His treasure is an extraordinary one as well; it has to be
a Protocosmic spirit-treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What horrible luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I
have many other clones. He shouldn’t be able to find the place
where my other clones are hidden.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak gave
Ning a cold glare, then died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His lordship is
dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone began to
panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant flag in
Ning’s hands swept forward. Boom! The Flag of the Heavens contained
a world within it, and he immediately dragged all of the servants of
the Seamless Gate’s base inside that world. In fact, he even
absorbed some of the local palaces and structures into the Flag of
the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world inside
the flag.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an empty
world. The Immortal cultivators and Fiendgods of the Seamless Gate
were all terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two vigorous streams of
power surged through the skies, forming a pair of enormous millstones
above and below them. These two giant millstones began to grind down
towards the people between them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the spatial
millstones began to crush down…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splat! Splat! Splat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The servants all
perished. Even the Fiendgods were completely slain and destroyed…and
one of the bracelets worn by one of the Fiendgods was completely
smashed apart. That Fiendgod’s other treasures, however, were left
unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One old man after
another began to appear. Each of them had different appearances, but
their auras were all identical to Youngflame Freak’s aura. There
was a total of fourteen of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak’s
fourteen clones stared at their surroundings. Instantly, the looks on
their faces changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fourteen clones
have been captured.” Youngflame Freak instantly understood…then
began to panic. “How is this possible? That Fiendgod was just an
ordinary Fiendgod, and his bracelet was just an ordinary
Heaven-ranked storage treasure. Generally speaking, powerful
Immortals wouldn’t deign to act against such puny Fiendgods. Even
if they did, they wouldn’t go so far as to destroy a Heaven-ranked
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, he had
no idea…that Ning knew exactly where he was. Patriarch Subhuti had
told Ning long ago. Thus, there was no chance for Youngflame Freak to
escape at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The millstones
once more came smashing down…and so the fourteen Celestial Immortal
clones were all crushed within this supreme Protocosmic
spirit-treasure. It must be understood that Ning was using his True
Immortal energy in controlling these treasures; even Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals would perish if they were trapped within this
stargold bead, to say nothing of Youngflame Freak!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The internal crushing
power of the Stargold Beads of the Heavens was no lower than the
power of the Eight Fires Qiankun World. Most importantly of all, once
you entered it, there was no way out. Empyrean Gods might be able to
endure the crushing power for a period of time, but they wouldn’t
be able to endure it forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Winterherald world.
Within Ironsoldier Hall, one of the three major headquarters of the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a massive,
towering edifice that was completely built using enormous swords,
sabers, staffs, and other weapons. It had the appearance of a
countless number of weapons plunged deep into the earth, but in
reality all of the ‘weapons’ were parts of a single titanic
formation. They were shaped as weapons for cosmetic purposes only.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Bloodfiend
suffered an attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main hall of
Ironsoldier Hall. This was a grand hall that was shaped like an
enormous axe. A middle-aged man was solemnly staring at a midair
mirror as two other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals hastened over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Bloodfiend
suffered an attack. These are the scenes from just now. Take a look.”
The leader of Ironsoldier Hall, ‘True Immortal Ironsoldier’,
spoke out. His power was significantly stronger than the power of the
other two, so he naturally became the temporary leader of the group.
However, each headquarters only had a total of three Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals, and so there really wasn’t much of a difference in
status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The other two
consisted of a male golden-armored Empyrean God and a female
pink-robed True Immortal. The two appeared to be quite intimate with
each other; clearly, they were a couple. They were known as the
‘Goldred Couple’, and they had a bit of a reputation in the Three
Realms. They were fairly average in terms of power, but had a bit of
a reputation for a rather unsavory reason. Empyrean God Goldspear had
thousands of concubines, while True Immortal Redflower had more than
ten thousand male lovers. The two of them really were a perfect pair
for each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldred Couple
stared towards the midair mirror, which was replaying the scenes from
earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
killed my loved ones. Now that my power has increased, I’m going to
wipe you all out! If I find one, I’ll kill one; if I find two, I’ll
kill a pair. I’ll make the Seamless Gate regret what it did!” The
mirror-Ning’s eyes were filled with madness…and then he
immediately attacked Youngflame Freak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took only one
stance…and Youngflame Freak was wiped out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He then completely
uprooted and destroyed the entire base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never seen
this Celestial Immortal before, but he’s quite handsome.” True
Immortal Redflower nibbled her lips, an interested look in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, he’s new. He
must’ve come out from some backwater place. Most likely, he just
broke through from being a Void-level Earth Immortal…but for him to
have such power means that he must’ve had some special encounters.
That flagpole is particularly powerful; it may well be a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure,” Empyrean God Goldspear evaluated. “In short,
this is just a person who deeply hates our Seamless Gate, and who was
lucky enough to break through to become a Celestial Immortal. He
doesn’t really matter. Immortal Bloodfiend can only curse his own
terrible luck, for him to have been chosen by this Celestial
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has close to the
power of a Pure Yang True Immortal. Can’t be too overconfident in
dealing with him,” True Immortal Ironsoldier said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Want me to
go capture him?” True Immortal Redflower had a greedy look in eyes.
She stared at the image of Ning as though she wanted to devour him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already left
that base. For now, his whereabouts are unknown,” True Immortal
Ironsoldier said. “If I use coresense to search for him, I’ll
probably disturb the Winterherald Army! Let’s just watch for now.
Now that we are on guard, if we notice this Celestial Immortal
attacking any of our other bases…Goldspear, you are an Empyrean
God. Teleport straight to him and execute him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll only take me
a single spear-strike to kill him.” Empyrean God Goldspear laughed
in a disdainful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Ironsoldier felt resigned. It was his bad luck to have been assigned
into a team with these two. Still…this was what his superiors had
arranged. There was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did you find
me?!” Youngflame Freak stared in terror at the Celestial Immortal
in front of him. Just now, his other fifteen clones had been
slaughtered by this Celestial Immortal. He had a total of sixteen
clones within this world, with only Immortal Bloodfiend being a
public figure; the other fifteen had all been hidden. The fourteen
hidden within the magic treasure were all dead…and now, even the
last one had been located.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Freak…you
are the reason I am here.” A cold voice rang out.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_19___Shocking_The_Three"></A>
Chapter 19 - Shocking The Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who…who are you?!”
Youngflame Freak stared towards the man before him in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you’ve
offended many, many people. You aren’t even able to guess at who I
am.” Ji Ning stood there, his face and his aura beginning to
completely change back to normal. The reason why he had used the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was so that he wouldn’t rattle the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate, giving him the chance
to first execute the sixteen clones of Youngflame Freak!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t hidden
his true identity and had gone straight for Youngflame Freak, the
Seamless Gate would’ve grown cautious and their Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals might have immediately slipped away. If he had gone
for them first instead, the Daofathers behind the Seamless Alliance
would’ve been alerted, at which point Ning wouldn’t have the time
needed to deal with Youngflame Freak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji…Ji Ning?!”
Youngflame Freak couldn’t believe it. He hurriedly said in terror,
“Spare me, spare my life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had a total of
eighteen clones. Sixteen were hidden here, while the other two were
in the Crimsonbright Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zhuanxu Realm was
fairly safe, but the Seamless Gate had already lost the war for the
Crimsonbright Realm. The two clones he had hidden there were in grave
danger, but he didn’t dare disobey the Seamless Gate’s orders. As
for creating new clones? It must be understood that every single
clone of his was an extraordinary one, comparable to his ‘true
body’. So long as one survived, he would remain alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in turn, the
creation of these clones required a very long period of time. The
storm had already descended; he simply didn’t have enough time at
all. Thus, once these sixteen were destroyed, only the final two
would be remaining. If they died as well, then he would be truly
dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as you spare
me, I can give all of the bugs that I’ve been raising to you. All
of them!” Youngflame Freak said frantically. “And Protocosmic
spirit-treasures; I can give them to you as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just die.” Ning
coldly stabbed out with the flagpole in his hands, and it pierced
straight through Youngflame Freak’s chest. The difference in power
between the two was simply too great; Youngflame Freak wasn’t able
to resist at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Youngflame
Freak was filled with terror and rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you die, your
treasures will become mine regardless.” Ning casually ripped the
flagpole out of Youngflame Freak’s body…and the soul in that body
dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wiping out the
sixteen clones of Youngflame Freak is just the appetizer. Soon, I
will start preparing for the main course.” Ning’s gaze was cold
as he turned to look at the other clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true targets were
the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals! They were what really mattered
in this war for karmic luck. They were able to command armies of
Immortals and Fiendgods, and were able to use incredibly powerful
spells and magic treasures. Only when they were the commanders would
the armies of Immortals and Fiendgods possess truly shocking levels
of power. Without them at the head, those armies would be much
weaker. The Three Realms only had so many Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals; every single loss would be noticed and felt by the
Seamless Gate. If ten were to die…that would be more than enough to
cause heartache for the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starseizer world. A
vast, desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, Manorlord.” An awe-inspiring sea of Celestial Immortals and
Loose Immortals all fell to their knees upon seeing Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord.”
Empyrean God Redsnow and the rest of the seven all bowed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
sent Ninefangs back to the Starseizer world was naturally to have the
people here get ready for battle. They had made their preparations
for war long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Starseizing Manor
has been hidden for many years now. The Three Realms have long since
forgotten our might and our name. As for you…you have lived here
within the Starseizing world for countless years. Now…it is time
for you to show the Three Realms your fangs!” Ning spoke in an icy
voice as he stared at the horde of Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FIGHT!” A
heaven-shaking roar rang out from the mouths of the countless
Immortals. Their eyes were all blazing with eager fire. They had
always known that the Three Realms were just outside, but never had
the chance to actually go out. They had been sealed in here for far,
far too long. The other Immortals of the Three Realms could rove
about, making friends everywhere, but they had to stay here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ji Ning had
bound the Starseizing Manor, they could leave, yes…but this was a
time of war. Which Celestial Immortal would dare to travel about by
himself to visit friends? The entire Three Realms had been swept up
into a storm of blood, and many of the Immortals had all gathered
together into armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Immortals had all
been feeling very stifled. But now…they would have the chance to
show their power in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” Ning ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, with a
series of rumbling sounds, the countless Immortals began to fly into
the skies. In a very orderly manner, they began to surround the
midair Ji Ning. A flood of natural energy surged towards them,
quickly coalescing into the form of an enormous Fiendgod. The
Starseizing world was a major world, after all, and the amount of
natural energy it contained was extremely vast. It was extremely
simple for a perfect Heaven Punisher to be formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a Heaven Punisher
took shape, with a Seven Planets God next to it. Both were thirty
thousand meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow, you go to
the second headquarters. I’ll go to the first one,” Ning said.
“We’ll handle the third one together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Seven Planets God nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher and the Seven Planets God simultaneously left the Starseizer
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were simply too
fast. Both of them used a spatial teleport to move towards their
destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironsoldier Hall, one
of the three headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, drink.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Ironsoldier and the Goldred Couple were sipping wine and relaxing
within a palace. There were maintaining a constant vigil, however;
once they found that crazy Celestial Immortal, Empyrean God Goldspear
would immediately attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here, my
pretty.” Goldspear pulled one of the dancing, singing women into
his arms, and the woman laughed as she picked up a cup of wine.
“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s drink
together.” Goldspear drank a cup, then lowered his mouth to kiss
the woman, passing the wine into her mouth from his. As for his
hands, both of them were already kneading and playing with the
woman’s chest. The nearby female Immortal, Redflower, didn’t care
at all….because she had two of her male playthings by her side,
attending to her needs. Ironsoldier felt rather uncomfortable with
this, but since he was a True Immortal, he was able to calmly ignore
it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had no idea that
Ji Ning had already killed the sixteen clones of Venomflame Freak.
Those fifteen hidden clones really had been hidden too well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a massive
explosion could be heard from outside. The entire Ironsoldier Hall
shook violently, and even the palace itself was trembling. Winecups
shattered and wine spilled everywhere as the dancers all cried out in
shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Ironsoldier, Empyrean God Goldspear, and True Immortal Redflower all
transformed into streaks of light, charging into the skies above the
palace. But upon reaching the outside, they became dazed…because a
massive, towering, thirty thousand meter Fiendgod had appeared before
them. This Fiendgod had no head, was barefoot, and wielded a pair of
massive swords in its hands. The formations in front of him were all
gleaming with golden light, but they were all visibly shuddering as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xingtian the Heaven
Punisher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at the face on
its chest; that’s Ji Ning! Sword Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning!”
The three of them were now stunned. Ji Ning had commanded a Heaven
Punisher in the Crimsonbright Realmwar and displayed godlike valor;
this story had long ago spread throughout the Three Realms. Ji Ning
definitely stood at the very peak of power amongst the Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals of the Three Realms. Although the three of them
had been assigned to the Zhuanxu Realm, they had read very detailed
intelligence reports regarding Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher slashed out with the giant twinswords, and with a boom, the
entire formation completely broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! How can this
be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation was
destroyed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of them felt
terror in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation had been
meant to protect their headquarters; it would be able to hold out for
a period of time even if twenty Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
jointly assaulted it. However, Ning’s Heaven Punisher was far more
powerful than twenty Empyrean Gods. It was at the Daofather level of
power…and in truth, even a Daofather golem had been suppressed by
Ning’s might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Ning had been
forced to do was deliver nine successive sword-blows in a short
period of time and the formation was completely chopped apart. As
soon as the three Seamless Gate experts had charged out and
recognized Ning, Ning had finished the job and charged straight
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run, run, RUN!”
All three of them were completely terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“TOO LATE!” A flood
of sword-light swept towards them, many tens of thousands of meters
in size, covering the skies and blotting out the sun. In fact, this
strike was even more terrifying than the strikes Ning delivered
during the Realmwar, because his sword-arts had clearly grown even
more exquisite and even faster. The slowest of the three, True
Immortal Redflower, saw the sword-light sweep past her body…and her
body was instantly transformed into ash. The only thing left behind
was the final echoes of an unwilling scream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” True Immortal
Ironsoldier hurriedly used an evasive technique, but how could he
compare in speed to Ning’s weapons? He was slain as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At such close range,
and faced with such a fast attack…there was no time to use a
spatial teleportation technique at all, much less use Greater
Teleportation. As for hiding within an estate-treasure? The only
result would be that Ning would collect it; it represented certain
death. Thus, if they wanted to escape, their only chance lay in
fleeing at high speed! When true experts of the Three Realms engaged
in battle against each other, they would generally rely on their
evasive techniques. Thus, everyone possessed some formidable evasive
skills. If they didn’t, possessing Protocosmic spirit-treasures
that were highly suited for fleeing also worked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, for
example, had once commanded a lightship that allowed him to match the
extremely fast speed of the Great Sage Who Swallows the Skies, of the
three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, True Immortal
Ironsoldier’s evasive techniques were poor, and he didn’t have
any top-quality Protocosmic spirit-treasures meant for fleeing.
Naturally…the only result was death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me. Spare me!”
Empyrean God Goldspear was utterly terrified. As he begged for mercy,
he immediately transformed into nine clones that fled in nine
different directions. Although every single clone was fairly weak, if
he didn’t do this he wouldn’t have any chance to escape at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light spun
around, causing the tens of thousands of meters around it to become a
region of death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All nine of Empyrean
God Goldspear’s clones were slain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the area
below with his gaze. Instantly, the world itself seemed to shatter as
the terrifying, fleeing Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals were
blown into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next.” Ning’s
Heaven Punisher turned and used a teleportation technique to head
towards the third headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own Realmwar had
ended more than two years ago. Ning’s soul heartforce technique had
made some further, minor improvements. Now…he was able to control a
hundred percent of the perfect Heaven Punisher’s power! He was
already very close to reaching maximum power in the past, and now
that he had perfect control over it, no energy leaked out of it at
all. Thus, he was now able to use the Heaven Punisher to teleport
with him, as though it was part of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t have
full control over it, there would be no way to teleport with it. He’d
have to rely on treasures like the Voidboat in order to travel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…there was no
need!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sneak attacks had to be
carried out quickly, with overwhelming force. Thus, Ning immediately
used the Heaven Punisher upon attacking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first headquarters
had been wiped out with incredible speed. The news of its destruction
had yet to even reach the third headquarters before Ning arrived. The
massive, towering Heaven Punisher stood barefoot upon the desolate
wilderness. Raising its twinswords up high, it furiously chopped down
upon the palace that was built atop the towering mountain peak. The
light of a formation began to flicker and flash as three Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals charged out from the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FLEE!” A voice
rang out in the minds of the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the
Daofather.” The three instantly understood. The Seamless Gate’s
Daofather had finally noticed and was frantically trying to warn
them…but alas, it was too late!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation
collapsed. Ning’s overwhelming powerful Heaven Punisher, two giant
swords in its hands, began its massacre of the three Seamless Gate
experts. The Empyrean God managed to have one of his clones escape,
but alas, the other seven clones he created were all destroyed, and
the parts of his soul in them were obliterated. He had lost too much
of his soul; the remnants of his soul in the seventh clone were
unable to survive on their own, and so his soul shattered and he
died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a weakness of
Empyrean Gods. Although their divine bodies were formidable, once you
destroyed their souls, they would die. For example, when Ning
acquired the Rahu Bow in the Crescent world, he had encountered the
corpse of Empyrean God Qi. Although Qi’s divine body was in perfect
shape, his soul had been destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one’s soul
suffered too much damage, the remaining parts would crumble as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I’ve
wiped out the second headquarters. They almost managed to escape. You
moved much faster than me.” The space around Ning turned blurry for
a moment as a voice rang out in his mind, then a towering,
spear-wielding Fiendgod appeared. It was the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow, let’s
go,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they spoke, a large
boat that was three hundred meters long appeared. This was the
Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the Voidboat. Ning currently had three
top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures; this was one meant for
escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning’s Heaven
Punisher and the Seven Planets God both flew into the Voidboat.
Although the Voidboat looked like it was only three hundred meters
long, it was like a tiny speck of sand that was capable of holding an
entire world within it. It was actually extremely spacious inside;
naturally, Ning’s Heaven Punisher and the Seven Planets God were
able to enter it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They tore a hole
through space, and the Voidboat departed from the Winterherald
world…heading towards a different majorworld of the Zhuanxu Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t going to
let up so easily!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine dead Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals? Not enough!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this all
about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Winterherald Army
on Winterherald planet had immediately noticed the ripples of power.
Their Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were all gathered together,
watching the scenes being displayed within the mirror. By the time
they noticed it, however, Ning had already started to wipe out the
third headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They saw a massive,
nearly naked Fiendgod who was dressed only in a fur loincloth and who
wielded two giant swords in his hands. The Fiendgod chopped down
against the formations, then completely swept through the
headquarters, not letting a single one of the three survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look at the
other two locations,” an Empyrean God said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The images in the
mirror quickly transformed to display the other two headquarters of
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter annihilation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter devastation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both headquarters had
been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wiped out?” The
commanders of the Winterherald Army stared at each other, stunned.
The three headquarters of the Seamless Gate held a total of nine
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, all of whom were hidden behind the
protective embrace of formations. They were all wiped out? They had
battled these nine Empyrean Gods and True Immortals for countless
years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Three Realms all possessed remarkable abilities. As soon as Ning
wiped out the first headquarters, some of them began to take notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
man, Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is quite
bold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning
actually dares to launch sneak attacks by himself, outside of a
Realmwar? He really is going all-out against the Seamless Gate.”
These major powers all sighed in amazement. They knew very well that
launching this sort of merciless sneak attack against the Seamless
Gate would utterly incense it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a different
major world. This vast world was filled with an endless aura of cold.
This was one of the true, major headquarters of the Seamless Gate…the
Third World!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wars against
Crimsonbright Realm and certain other realms were conducted by the
Fifth World of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Zhuanxu
Realm, the even more powerful Third World was responsible for
attacking it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Third World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” At the
very peak of a towering mountain that emanated an aura of infinite
cold, there was a palace with a man seated in the lotus position
within it. The man had long, jade-green hair and jade-green eyebrows.
His eyes were open, and they were filled with ice. His coresense had
spread out to cover the entire Zhuanxu World. Nine of his Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals had perished in such a short period of
time…he was now completely enraged and stunned.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_20___Kill__Kill__Kill"></A>
Chapter 20 - Kill, Kill, Kill!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s courting
death!” The skinny, jade-haired elder seated atop the cloud of beds
was absolutely stunned and enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black energy swirled in
the air beneath his cloud, coalescing into the form of a black-robed
man. The black-robed man raised his head to look at the skinny elder.
“Uncle-master Helljade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.”
Daofather Helljade glanced at the black-robed figure below him. He
addressed him respectfully as ‘Godking’, as this man was still
the nominal leader of the Seamless Gate. Although in power, Daofather
Helljade was a bit more powerful than the ‘Godking’, the Godking
was the sole heir to their true ‘king’, who every single True
Fiend and Daofather of the Seamless Gate venerated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, this
veneration extended to the ‘Godking’ as well. Normally, Daofather
Helljade stood guard over the Third World, but it was still the
Godking who was usually in charge of deployments and army movements.
In fact, all of the Seamless Gate’s matters throughout the Three
Realms were the responsibility of the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World, for
example; there was actually a different Daofather who stood guard
over it, but at important moments the ‘Godking’ would make the
arrangements and deployments. He had learned the techniques of the
‘king’ of the Seamless Gate, the Lord of the Demonheart, allowing
him to silently and soundlessly communicate in secret with any living
creature of the Three Realms. This made it so that the Nuwa Alliance
found it very hard to uncover the deployments and schemes of the
Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic. My
true body is already beginning to summon our generals.” The Godking
chuckled, but his eyes were filled with ice. “No matter what, we
aren’t going to let Ji Ning escape again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We absolutely
cannot let him escape again,” Daofather Helljade said angrily. “He
killed nine of our Empyrean Gods and True Immortals just now. We’ve
fought with the Zhuanxu Realm for so long, but we had only lost a
single True Immortal to date. Now, all of sudden, we’ve lost this
many! This Ji Ning is simply far too brash and wild. He actually
dares to sneak attack us? He’s looking to die! We have to wipe him
out. He cannot be allowed to escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Godking nodded as well. He, too, felt pain in his heart at what had
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already lost
dozens of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals during their defeat at the
Crimsonbright Realmwar. Now, Ji Ning had suddenly struck out of
nowhere and wiped out nine more. How could he not feel pain? How
could he not feel anger?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
army is already assembling. Just give me a bit of time, and he’ll
definitely die.” The Godking’s voice was filled with a murderous
intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, assemble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World held a
truly shocking number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. Once they
received the Godking’s order, they immediately began to assemble
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skylands major
world of the Zhuanxu Realm. There was a towering golden structure in
this world within a region surrounded by mountain peaks. It was quite
dazzling and eye-catching. This was one of the two major bases of the
Seamless Gate on the Skylands world, and it held a total of four
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them had
been relaxing, but upon receiving their orders they began to panic.
One had been training quietly, one had been teaching disciples, and
the others had been eating as the Godking’s orders had suddenly
come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space shattered apart,
and a three hundred meter boat crashed in through the Void, appearing
outside this towering edifice. Two massive Fiendgods appeared
simultaneously. The Seven Planets God simply willed it, and the
surrounding space became completely sealed and locked. Ning’s
Heaven Punisher and the Seven Planets God simultaneously struck out
with their weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An explosive collision
could be heard, as though the heavens themselves had been shattered.
In the blink of an eye, the extremely tough and tenacious formations
surrounding the structure had been shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Seven
Planets God simultaneously charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were one step
ahead, they would survive. If they were one step behind, their souls
would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals had received the order to withdraw…but alas,
only one of them was able to just barely escape. The other three were
slaughtered by Ning and the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord.” The
Seven Planets God looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
rubble before him. His coresense had long ago spread out to cover the
entire Skylands world, and he sent mentally to Redsnow, “We’re
not going to have any more opportunities. We were incredibly fast,
tearing straight through the Void to travel from Winterherald to this
place, but were just barely able to kill three of them. The other
headquarters here on Skylands has already been evacuated. I imagine
the other major worlds have been evacuated as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve spread
multiple headquarters across many major worlds. I refuse to believe
they’d be willing to withdraw from all of them,” the Seven
Planets God sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
other major worlds and take a look. Even if we can’t kill many of
them, we can destroy their bases.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t easy to
build up a headquarters like this. Ning had paid a significant price
to set up the grand formations around Swallow Mountain, and the
formations that were protecting these Seamless Gate headquarters were
powerful enough to receive nine successive strikes from Ning’s
Heaven Punisher, which had the power of a Daofather. Every single
headquarters had been very expensive to build up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat flew out
from the Skylands world, once more tearing through the Void and
hastening to another major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s true
body was sending the orders and redeploying his soldiers. “The six
of you, stand guard over Divine Goldlight Mountain. The eight of you,
stand guard over the Seamless City…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Various individuals
were being ordered to withdraw, but the Godking was also sending some
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals out to gather together at some
special locations, such as the Seamless City or some other citadels.
Once ten of them hid inside these war-citadels and joined
together…even Ji Ning would find it difficult to breach their
defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, if they
didn’t have any war-forts protecting them, Ji Ning would find it
much easier to deal with them. But those war-forts were very hard to
breach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why, during
the Realmwar against the Crimsonbright Realm, once one side retreated
into its war-citadel, the other side would halt its attacks. Both
sides understood that unless there was an enormous disparity in
power, it would be very hard to breach the defenses of a war-citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You guys, go draw Ji
Ning’s attention and tie him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go draw his
attention.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buy some time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s orders
came in rapid succession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat tore
through the Void, arriving at yet another major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are eight
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals hiding within the Seamless City
here.” Ning’s heartforce instantly discovered the black,
levitating Seamless City. He immediately sent a mental message to the
nearby Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hiding inside a
Seamless City? Hmph. If they are hiding inside a war-citadel…even
if we attack, it’ll be hard for us to break through,” the Seven
Planets God sent mentally. “If there were eighteen of them standing
guard within a Seamless City, we’d have no chance at all…but
there are only eight of them. If we join together, we still have a
chance. The Seamless Gate is intentionally giving us false hopes;
they want us to attack and waste time here. I imagine that they are
currently deploying their armies against us. Soon, their armies will
arrive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
understood this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The Voidboat once
more departed, heading towards yet another major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning actually
decided to leave the entire Zhuanxu Realm and head to a different
realm, the Xingtian Realm. Wargod Xingtian, the Heaven Punisher, was
a tremendously powerful figure. How could anyone who was proclaimed
as a ‘God of War’ during the Primordial Era be weak? And given
that he was a member of the Primordial Imperial Clan, the realm under
his control was definitely not weaker than the Zhuanxu Realm at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sudden assault
against a completely different realm resulted in him reaping the
rewards he wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In one realm after
another, the forces of the Seamless Gate fell into chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all supreme,
top-tier realms…and so the entire Seamless Alliance was filled with
commotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just running
around randomly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning really moves
quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True Gods and
Daofathers of the Seamless Gate were so angry, their teeth hurt. In
fact, all of them wanted to personally intervene…but they could
sense coresenses of the major powers of the Nuwa Alliance clashing
against their own coresenses. The Nuwa Alliance was watching all this
happen as well. The major powers of the Seamless Gate could sense the
coresenses of terrifying figures such as Lord Tathagata the Buddha,
Daoist Three Purities, Subhuti, Fuxi, Suiren, and others. Instantly,
they all calmed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All they could do was
watch and do their best to redeploy their soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Third World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of 289 Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals had all been gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
and Daofather Helljade stared downwards at the group of Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals. The Third World was meant to deal with the
Zhuanxu Realm and other top-tier Realms. Monarch Zhuanxu alone had
more than six hundred Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under his
command, to say nothing of the rest of the Five Monarchs and the
other realms. He controlled several times as many experts as
Daofather Crimsonbright. This was the difference between a powerful
realm and a weak realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals all preferred to follow experts, after all. If you could
become a disciple to Daofather Three Purities, why would you choose
to become a disciple to Daofather Crimsonbright instead? The strong
would naturally grow stronger and the weak would naturally grow
weaker. The likes of Lord Buddha, for example, had an entire pile of
Daofathers under his command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zhuanxu Realm alone
had so many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. The Third World had to
simultaneously deal with the Zhuanxu Realm and multiple other realms;
naturally, it had a large number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
Thus, it didn’t take too much time for it to summon 289 of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join together into
the Seamless Infinity Formation. You have to slay Ji Ning,” the
black-robed Godking ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the 289
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals acknowledged in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Head out!” The
Godking gave the order, and the battalion of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals all flew into a black shuttle, then disappeared into the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Infinity
Formation, when formed by more than two hundred Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, was unfathomably more powerful than the Three Eyed
Demon that had been formed by the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater. It had the power to battle against even real True Gods
or Daofathers! It would indeed be quite easy for it to slay Ning’s
Heaven Punisher. One or two Empyrean Gods or True Immortals might not
be a match for it, but a large number of them would prove to be a
terrifying threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In any war, a single
person by himself was a puny, unremarkable force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unless, of course, you
had reached Nuwa’s level. Even the leaders of the Daoist Path and
the Buddhist Sangha had a chance of dying in the war, which was why
Subhuti hadn’t joined in the first one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Voidboat continued to
frantically travel from one major world to the next. Ning knew that
he was taking on tremendous risks, but his decision to incense and
incite the Seamless Gate was always a dangerous one. So he would
kill, kill, kill! Kill as many as he could! His heartforce was spread
around him in a giant bubble; as soon as something happened, he would
immediately flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing those
nine on Winterherald, he had killed six more in his dangerous
lightning strikes. Ning, however, wanted to kill even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, Ji Ning! The
Seamless Gate’s army has arrived. You need to flee! Subhuti’s
voice suddenly blasted out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, space itself blew apart as a black shuttle suddenly
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the 289 Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals had assembled on the Fifth World, the Godking
had personally cast a spell to completely prevent any outside force
from scrying on it! Subhuti’s [Dream of the Three Worlds] was
formidable, but the Godking had been personally been taught by the
Lord of the Demonheart, and so his abilities were incredible as well.
If he focused on blocking any scrying, he was still capable of
preventing Subhuti from detecting what he didn’t want them to
detect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after the group of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals left the Third World aboard the
black shuttle did Subhuti discover them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately notified
Ning…just as the grand army was about to arrive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Subhuti’s voice
transmission caused Ning to feel shocked, but he immediately tore
into the Void to flee. Thus, just as the Seamless Gate’s army
appeared, Ning began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! As soon as
the Voidboat tore into the Void to escape, the black shuttle also
pierced into the Void. They were able to trace the spatial ripples to
find out exactly which region Ning’s Voidboat was headed towards.

Chapter 21 - All For Nothing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world filled
with fire, a vast, endless world. In fact, it was a bit vaster than
even the Celestial Realm or the Netherworld Kingdom! This world was
comparable to a hundred Grand Xia’s in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was a holy
land for the human race!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world
created by the most powerful and oldest human alive…Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Mother Nuwa had
created the human race, it had started off very weak. Suiren was
alive during those earliest of days. Despite his weakness, he not
only learned how to control fire and taugh it to his fellows, he also
unified the weak human race under his rule and led the humans to a
path that permitted their survival during the ancient era where
Fiendgods ruled. Suiren was tremendously talented and tremendously
steadfast, and he managed to create an inconceivable path for himself
and his race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the most
exalted, most revered, most supreme emperor of the entire human
race…the leader of the Three Emperors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren was low-key and
a down-to-earth person. He often roamed in the primordial chaos, and
even cut a canal through it, creating a vast major world in the
canal. This world was the Kindlefire major world, and it became a
truly sacred land for the human race. One could use the size of a
created world to judge the power of its creator, and Suiren’s
Kindlefire world was second only to Nuwa’s world in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of power…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren’s power was
unfathomable. During the Primordial Era, even the Elder God of Fire,
Zhurong, a god who lived for battle, admitted that he was not a match
for Suiren after sparring against him. Fuxi and Shennong often
appeared in the Three Realms, but Suiren always kept to himself in
seclusion. His very existence, however, was a mighty sword hanging
over the necks of any who dared to cause the human race harm. He was
the oldest and most powerful member of the human race. Even if he
didn’t actually emerge from seclusion, no one in the Three Realms
would dare to forget about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Seamless Gate
felt great dread towards this almighty human expert. Some powerful
Outsiders had run into Suiren in the primordial chaos, and Suiren had
slaughtered them all! That scene had stunned the entire Three Realms,
and had made the Seamless Gate even more nervous regarding his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was his power that
ensured that the human race remained the unquestioned leader of the
myriad races. Not even the True Gods of Primordial Chaos would argue
against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very top of a
towering, divine mountain of fire, a man was seated in the lotus
position, nearly naked and clad only in a fur loincloth. His black
hair was spread casually over his shoulders, with every single strand
of hair having an aura of inconceivable might, as though they were
the horns of a dragon. His face was covered with a thick beard, and
his eyes seemed capable of seeing into the future. Although he simply
sat there atop the mountain…in truth, his gaze was spread
throughout the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a transcendental
figure that cared about little…but now that the storm had arrived,
he was watching over everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Guo Zi.” Suiren’s
voice was vigorous and powerful. It was transmitted more than three
hundred thousand kilometers away, straight into the ears of a woman
who was amongst a crowd of thousands who were quietly training in
front of a massive image of a god.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” The human
woman, face covered with divine tattoos, rose to her feet. The
tattoos on her face was a relic from back when humans tried out many
different types of cultivation methods. Guo Zi was one of the humans
who had been willing to try anything, no matter the risk, and Suiren
had eventually accepted her as his foster daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lead your brigade to
go rescue Ji Ning,” Suiren order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Guo Zi said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren, as the oldest
Human Emperor, had many, many experts following him. In the
Kindlefire world alone, he had more than ten Daofather subordinates
and more than ten thousand Empyrean God and True Immortal
subordinates! The number of Celestial Immortals under his command was
even more astonishing. This place, a holy land for the human race,
could be described as the most powerful of the major worlds. The
Seamless Gate didn’t even dare to attempt to infiltrate it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat was
hurtling forward through the infinite Void. Every so often, it would
tear through the Void to travel to another world, then once more
begin to fly at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the Voidboat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Seven
Planets God didn’t dare to be the slightest bit overconfident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate’s
army is very powerful. If we end up trapped, we’ll definitely die,”
the Seven Planets God sent mentally. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, hold on for
just a while longer. Human Emperor Suiren has already sent Empyrean
Goddess Guo Zi in command of 365 Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to
reinforce you.” Subhuti’s voice rang out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief, then turned to glance backwards. The long black
shuttle behind him was still chasing at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. We were just a
fraction too slow.” There were nearly three hundred Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals gathered aboard the black shuttle. The leader was
a tall, skeletal-looking Fiendgod whose flaming eyes stared intently
towards the distant Voidboat. “If Ji Ning was just slightly slower
just now…our Seamless Infinity Formation would’ve been able to
lock the surrounding space and prevent him from fleeing. It was so
close! But now, we can’t catch up to him no matter how we try.
Damn. Damn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major powers of
the Nuwa Alliance truly are formidable as well. We were quite fast;
we tore straight through the Void and into the Three Realms, but they
were still able to discover us and notify Ji Ning. Ji Ning ran quite
quickly as well.” A man holding a scimitar in his arms gave his
solemn opinion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. What a pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one step
behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals felt resentful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately for Ning,
Subhuti had warned him, and so he had chosen to enter the Voidboat
and flee without hesitating at all! He had been just half a step
ahead of them. If it wasn’t for that half-step, his foes would’ve
been able to activate their Seamless Infinity Formation and
completely lock down the surrounding area for ten thousand
kilometers. The power of that formation was enough to ensure that
even the Voidboat would find it difficult to tear a path to the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…Ning had been
able to escape before their all-encompassing net had been set up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep chasing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase him down, no
matter what. If Ji Ning makes even the slightest mistake, we’ll be
able to catch and trap him,” the skeletal Fiendgod growled. If Ning
made some mistakes due to being panicked by this life-threatening
situation, he would be caught.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One continued to flee,
the other continued to chase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through the infinite
Void, through the major worlds, through the minor worlds…the
pursuit continued. Ning was riding aboard the Voidboat, while his
foes were also riding a supreme Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the
‘Heavenwitch shuttle’. Both were extremely well-suited for
high-speed maneuvers through the Void, and for a time the two were
equally matched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
face of the skeletal Fiendgod aboard the Heavenwitch shuttle changed,
along with the faces of his fellows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blazing mountain had
appeared, hanging in the skies above the vast, sea-like heavens. The
blazing mountain had multiple figures standing on it, each possessing
an aura of ancientness. These were all experts who had been alive
since the Primordial Era, and the leader was Empyrean Goddess Guo Zi,
whose murderous aura filled the heavens. A total of 365 Empyrean gods
and True Immortals were by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Voidboat, it
flew straight next to the blazing mountain, and as it did two
towering Fiendgods came walking out from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two armies stared
at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both consisted of the
elites of their respective camps. One side was skilled in the the
‘Seamless Infinity Formation’ which the Seamless Gate’s king
had created, while the Nuwa Alliance had its own incredibly powerful
‘Sidereal Stargod Formation’. During the Primordial Era, the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who used this grand formation were
similarly able to fight against True Gods and Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you wish to
battle?” Empyrean Goddess Guo Zi stared at them coldly. Her voice
was like ice, but it shook Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
skeletal Fiendgod pointed towards Ning, then said coldly, “Consider
yourself lucky this time. You managed to escape by a hair. But your
actions…well, you are looking to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looking to die? Then
come here and kill me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
him, his voice similarly icy. “If you have the ability to kill me,
come and do so. I’m right here. What’s the point of just making
empty threats?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skeletal Fiendgod
ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two flames blazed
within his eyes as he swept his gaze over the powerful Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals standing atop the fiery mountain. All he could do,
however, was swallow his resentment. Although Ji Ning was rather
reckless in what he did…by holding on for a period of time, he had
been able to receive reinforcements from the Nuwa Alliance. The
Seamless Gate had not decided to launch the Endwar yet. For now, they
were helpless when faced with such a powerful enemy army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.” The
Godking’s voice rang out within the mind of the skeletal Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
skeletal Fiendgod had no choice but to give this resentful order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The Heavenwitch
shuttle tore a hole into the Void, departing from this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Third World. Both
the Godking and Daofather Helljade were standing in midair, watching
as this unfolded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Godking’s eyes flashed with cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity. We were
just one step behind.” Daofather Helljade said in a cold voice,
“But that one step meant that we were unable to catch him. This Ji
Ning fellow actually has a supreme Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the
Voidboat. This Voidboat is a treasure that existed long ago, even
before our Seamless Chaosworld had engaged in the first war against
the Pangu Chaosworld. It originally belonged to Daoist Threelives.
Threelives…he truly was a valiant, courageous warrior. He was
extraordinarily brave, and quite willing to be vicious to himself
when needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Godking nodded as well. He, too, remembered the valiant, powerful
Daoist Threelives. Although Threelives had never mastered a Heavenly
Dao, he was able to rely on his powerful True God body and his
utterly terrifying divine ability, the [Starseizing Hand], to slay
multiple True Fiends and Daofathers of the Seamless Gate. The power
of his [Starseizing Hand] was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has the
Voidboat. The only way to kill him is to first seal off spacetime in
the area around him or set up a trap for him. The second way is to
use an even better flying treasure, but the only ones better than the
Voidboat are all Chaos treasures.” The Godking frowned. “Our side
only has a single Chaos treasure meant for high-speed flying, but
it’s with Daomother Devilhand! Daomother Devilhand is a very
solitary figure. She wouldn’t necessarily be willing to hand such
an incomparably important Chaos treasure over to a few Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Given
Devilhand’s temperament, it’ll be hard to make her agree.”
Daofather Helljade nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was a truly
terrifying fiend who had once unleashed a storm of blood and murder
across the Seamless Chaosworld. The countless experts of the Seamless
Chaosworld had all been terrified whenever they had heard her name.
Her power also came from her hands, but she was different from Daoist
Threelives. The reason why Daomother Devilhand’s hands were so
powerful was because she had acquired a set of glove-type Chaos
treasures in the primordial chaos. She had created a divine ability
to go with the gloves, a supreme technique known as the ‘Extinction
Devilhands’. Perhaps in terms of fleeing abilities, she was
inferior to the Lord of All Fiends, but she wasn’t the slightest
bit weaker than him in terms of actual combat power. It had been the
Lord of the Demonheart, and him alone, who had been able to subdue
this demon amongst demons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning really is
courting death.” The more the Godking thought about what had just
happened, the angrier he became. Ji Ning’s slaying of those fifteen
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals didn’t have much of an impact on
his total combat force, but it had grave implications for his
disposition of forces across the entire Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he continued to lay
down forces in a spread-out manner as he currently did, Ji Ning would
once more succeed in his ambushes. But if he was to change his force
layout, then he would have to do so throughout the entire Three
Realms. The price of such a change would be enormous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was currently
expressing his thanks to Empyrean Goddess Guo Zi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, you and
your friends came in the nick of time, fellow Daoist Guo Zi.
Otherwise, I would’ve been in grave danger.” Ning had already
dispersed the Heaven Punisher and allowed his million-plus Immortals
to teleport back into the Starseizer world. By his side stood only
Redsnow and the rest of the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came to rescue you
on orders of Human Emperor Suiren. If you want to thank someone,
thank the Human Emperor.” Empyrean Goddess Guo Zi smiled and nodded
towards Ning, and the ancient Empyrean Gods and True Immortals behind
her nodded towards him as well. They all treated Ning in quite a
friendly manner, because Ning himself was of the human race. These
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals had been born in an era when the
human race was still young and weak, and so they placed even more
importance on solidarity with their fellow humans.

Chapter 22 - Negotiations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…Ji Ning,
your actions are far too risky,” Empyrean Goddess Guo Zi said.
“Right now, our two sides are only engaging in small-scale
skirmishes against each other. Both sides are still holding back, as
no one is willing to expand the scale of the war just yet. Both sides
are searching for weaknesses and openings, so as to win the war for
karmic luck. Not only are we trying to win, we are also trying to
ensure that our Empyrean Gods and True Immortals will survive. The
Seamless Gate is trying to do the same thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we win the
war for karmic luck, if all of our Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
end up bdying, along with the majority of our True Gods and
Daofathers…what’s the point?” Guo Zi looked towards Ning.
“Until the final moment arrives, neither side is willing to launch
a frenzied, all-out assault. When that final Endwar comes, it will be
a massacre on both sides.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is an
invisible line which neither side is willing to cross. But you…you’ve
crossed that line.” Guo Zi gazed towards Ning. “But of course,
that’s just you, and so the Seamless Gate will only act against you
and you alone. The further across that line you dare step, the more
effort they will put into getting rid of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…don’t
worry too much. If they begin to deploy their Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals in large numbers, we’ll immediately move to stop them,
because any actions involving nearly three hundred such experts is an
act of war.” Guo Zi continued to look at Ning. “But if they just
send small numbers of their most top-tier Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to kill you, there’s no way we can send an army to stop
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are very
powerful, but the Seamless Gate also has some truly astonishing
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on their side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Fellow
Daoist Guo Zi, I understand these things. But since I’ve already
chosen to embark on this path, I naturally am prepared for the
consequences.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guo Zi no longer tried
to dissuade him. She knew that Ning was a powerful Empyrean God and a
True Immortal, not a fool. And so she bid farewell and left, along
with her forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he rode
his Voidboat back to Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
The mountain peaks of the Five Treasure Peaks still pierced high into
the clouds, and things were as quiet as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the seven
Empyrean Gods landed atop the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you can’t
ignore what Guo Zi said just now,” Empyrean God Redsnow said
worriedly. “Although you are powerful, our Nuwa Alliance alone has
multiple figures who are on your level, such as the various divine
archers. If any of them are given Daofruit of primordial chaos,
they’ll probably be a bit more powerful than even you with your
perfect Heaven Punisher. The Seamless Gate has powerful figure as
well, and none of them are easy to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I encounter an
army, there’s nothing I can do, but if I encounter just one person,
I can still fight back,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t disregard
what she said. There are those who are more powerful than us when
they use Chaos treasures or Daofruit,” Redsnow said. Primelight and
the rest of the seven looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. In
truth, both sides had a tacit understanding with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you are fighting by
yourself, then I’ll send a single person to deal with you. Whoever
ends up dying can only blame himself for being too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, a madman
appeared on your side who is ambushing and murdering my subordinates?
He’s going too far. I’m going to send my army after him! If this
madman halts his actions, I’ll naturally no longer have an excuse
to send out an army; only if you employ an army will we do the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This came without any
negotiations or public declarations, but this was indeed how both
sides acted. This was a rule of their war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there were no rules
at all, then it would be easy for things to rapidly escalate until a
point was reached where the Endwar would begin prematurely. Clearly,
neither side wished for the Endwar to begin just yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the thatched
cottage. Ning was seated in the lotus position, waiting patiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had risked his life
today. Why? To incite the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…suddenly, a
thought-strand descended upon Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” An icy
voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally.” Ning
allowed the thought-strand to guide him into the dreamworld. This was
exactly what he wanted; to negotiate with the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the dreamworld
of darkness. The towering throne was still hovering within the center
of this world, and the black-robed Godking sat upon it, staring down
at the figure which had just appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
Godking roared with absolute fury, “You actually dare to rely on
your personal power to assault some of the bases of my Seamless Gate?
You are the first person in the Nuwa Alliance who dares to do such a
thing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, there were
quite a few Empyrean Gods and True Immortals with deep-seated hatred
towards the Seamless Gate. However, Ji Ning was the only one who was
actually willing to risk his life in such a manner, and who had the
power to carry it out! The formations around those bases were
generally capable of withstanding the combined attacks of more than
twenty Empyrean Gods and True Immortals for a period of time, after
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you want?”
Ning raised his head to look at the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking paused,
then growled out, “Fifteen Empyrean Gods and True Immortals have
died by your hand. If you let matters rest, I can let bygones be
bygones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking, in the
end, had chosen to swallow his rage. He had to take into
consideration his disposition of forces across the entire Three
Realms, and he couldn’t perpetually be on alert against Ji Ning’s
ambushes. His only option would be to change his force disposition
throughout the entire Three Realms, but that would come at a price.
For example, if he withdrew all the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
from the bases and headquarters, there were a number of major worlds
that would become impossible to penetrate and infiltrate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let bygones be
bygones?” Ning looked at the Godking. “I can let matters rest…but
I have a request.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was utterly
enraged. This child actually dared to make a request? But the Godking
still suppressed his anger and said, “Speak!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei back to me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
stunned…and then he began to roar with laughter. His laughter,
tinged with fury, shook the entire world of darkness. “So the
reason why you’ve gone so crazy is for Yu Wei. It seems that woman
is quite important to you, for you to risk your life in such a way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I can risk my life for her sake. If you hand her to me, I’ll
immediately halt. If you don’t…I’ll keep killing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are doing
this to extort us, to force our hand?” The Godking’s voice was
like ice. “Ji Ning, you value yourself too highly. I’m just
trying to avoid a bit of unnecessary trouble, which is why I gave you
a chance to calm things down with us. But you actually dare to
threaten us, the Seamless Gate? You truly are too arrogant. Do you
think that just because you succeeded with your first ambush, you’ll
succeed in a second or a third ambush? Do you really think that our
Seamless Gate is unable to deal with a stripling like you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who was the Godking? He
was, nominally speaking, the leader of the entire Seamless Gate. He
could converse as equals with even the Three Emperors of Mankind or
the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, the Godking
had been putting on a charitable, magnanimous air; if Ning halted, he
would spare Ning. But now, Ning dared to make requests of him? Fine,
then; if the request wasn’t excessive, the Godking would agree to
it. But Ning had actually carried out these actions to threaten the
Seamless Gate, to force them to do something they didn’t want to
do? That was courting death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only hope for you
to return her to me, Godking.” Ning looked at the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” The
Godking stared back at Ning. “You only have two options before you.
To halt and be spared, or to continue and perish. As for Yu Wei…you
can forget about her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking stared back
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is
courting death.” The Godking felt even angrier now. “An Empyrean
God actually dares to try to threaten and extort the Seamless Gate?
What a joke. A joke!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
original incarnation was that of the Seamless Chaosworld, a world on
par with the Pangu Chaosworld. How could a power like this allow
itself to be extorted?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there by
himself within the thatched cottage. He sat there for a long, long
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the chances
are very slim…I will still go and kill them. Kill them until they
can no longer bear it.” A breathtaking determination could be seen
in Ning’s eyes. This was a dangerous path, a path which involved
repeatedly risking his life…but that was the nature of his
decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cast the matter to
the back of his mind, sending his mind into the Starseizing Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main palace
of the manor was a large pile of treasures. These were the treasures
he had acquired during his earlier ambushes. Ning quickly began to
bind them to himself. These treasures might not be too useful to him,
but they’d be plenty of help to other Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals. If he could increase the power of his forces, their
chances of success in the future would be slightly greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Protocosmic
spirit-treasure…but it’s just a low-grade one of ordinary power.
Still, quite interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few Pure
Yang Immortal pills. Great Firmanent Immortal pills. Poison?” Ning
quickly finished sorting through all of the treasures of the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning began to
bind all of the various treasures left behind by the many slain
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals. This happened quite quickly,
as these were the treasures dropped by the low-level figures he had
casually mopped up after killing the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals. Their items weren’t particularly valuable, with most
being at the Immortal-rank at best. Every so often, he would be lucky
and encounter a Pure Yang treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
treasures left behind by Youngflame Freak. Hrm…where’s the
Worldhold Pagoda?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pity. The Worldhold
Pagoda isn’t with these sixteen clones.” Ning still remembered
how the Worldhold Pagoda had sent him to the Nihilum Zone. Still,
after searching through all the items, he still hadn’t been able to
find it. Instead, he encountered some bugs and aberrations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning paid no notice to
most of Youngflame Freak’s treasures, but one treasure did attract
his attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
pitch-black stone stele was hanging there in midair. The stone stele
was emanating a faint aura of might. Although the aura was very weak,
it had an exalted quality about it, far more exalted than even the
aura which Patriarch Subhuti had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s true
body remained within the thatched cottage, he quickly sent out a
strand of divine power to form a body which manifested within the
Starseizing Manor. He took a personal, close look at the levitating
black stone stele.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_23___Stone_Stele"></A>
Chapter 23 - Stone Stele
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous black
stone stele was 299 meters tall, and it emanated an aura of majesty
that was so faint, it could only be sensed from less than 300 meters
away. The aura, however, had an exalted quality about it. Ji Ning
only saw two enormous, strange characters carved into the face of the
stone stele facing him, while the other side was filled with
countless strange characters that were clustered as densely as ants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These characters…?”
Ning examined them carefully. “I’ve never seen these characters
before. It seems as though the Three Realms doesn’t have a language
like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never seen
them before, but was certain that these were characters from a
language, because they were actually quite similar to the characters
of the human race. The two enormous characters on the front, in
particular…Ning could almost sense what they meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try with
coresense first.” Ning willed his coresense to surge forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…?” Ning
stared at the stone stele in surprise. “How can this be?
Impossible. Why is it that my coresense sees nothing at all? It’s
as though nothing is there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that this
stone stele is covered with a restrictive spell that blocks out
coresense?” Ning pondered for a moment. “Let me try with
heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was
invisible, undetectable, and extremely formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, his true
body in the outside world sent its powerful heartforce into the
underwater estate to cover the stone stele. This caused Ning’s face
to truly change, because he discovered…that all his heartforce
found nothing whatsoever. It was as though the stone stele didn’t
even exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…” Ning
stretched his hand out to touch the stone stele. The stone was icy
cold, and its surface was very rough. “This stone stele is clearly
right in front of me. How can it be that not even heartforce can
detect it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an
extraordinary item. In fact…it isn’t even of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This thought instantly
flashed past Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two enormous
characters engraved on the stone stele…the countless tiny
characters on the back of the stele…the unique runes engraved on
other parts of it…clearly, someone had created this item! The stone
stele’s aura was so powerful that the creator had to at least be on
the level of the Buddhist and Daoist leaders. In fact, he might be
even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For heartforce to be
unable to discover the stone stele when one could see it with the
naked eye and touch it with the hand…Ning had never, ever heard of
such a strange item. Such an item shouldn’t be able to exist within
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had to have come
from the primordial chaos outside the Three Realms! Ever since the
most ancient of days, the unique items found within the primordial
chaos were generally referred to as Chaos treasures. They were either
used as ingredients for forging treasures, or used as treasures
themselves. When used as treasures, they would become far more
powerful than Protocosmic spirit-treasures, and so they would be
titled ‘Chaos treasures’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where and how were
Chaos treasures born? Hard to say. The primordial chaos did indeed
give birth to Chaos treasures, but the terrifying golems that the
‘Lord of All Things’ had created were definitely no weaker than
any Chaos treasure. Thus, the Three Realms had suspected for some
time now that some of the more powerful Outsiders were perhaps
capable of creating artifacts that rivaled Chaos treasures in might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can this be a Chaos
treasure?” A thought flashed through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a figure
appeared. Ning’s true body descended upon the clone, merging into
it. As for the outside world…Ning left a small amount of his divine
power there, in the form of yet another clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Neither coresense
not heartforce can detect it. That leaves just divine power and
Immortal energy” Ning picked up the stone stele, then gently placed
it down within the very center of the hall. Previously, he had
thought this to simply be a treasure which Youngflame Freak had
acquired by luck; he didn’t think it could possibly be particularly
powerful. But now, it seemed, this stone stele had a weighty
background to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even coresense or
heartforce could detect it. Most likely, the other major powers of
the Three Realms didn’t even know that it existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Freak.
Oh, Youngflame Freak. For a Celestial Immortal like you to have been
in possession of a treasure like this…if it wasn’t for the fact
that I wanted to gain revenge for my mother and for junior
apprentice-brother Northson, I probably wouldn’t have been able to
acquire something like this. This should be an item from the
primordial chaos…I wonder if it is a Chaos treasure?” Ning felt a
certain itchiness in his heart. If this really was a Chaos treasure,
this would be a tremendous stroke of luck for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, not all
items from the primordial chaos were particularly valuable. For
example, when first testing out the Heaven Punisher, Ning had been
able to shatter apart ‘chaos goldstone’. Shennong located many
different medicinal herbs within the primordial chaos, but their
value was far, far lower than that of a Chaos treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try to bind
it first.” Ning sat down in the lotus position, placing his hand
atop the giant stone stele. The stone stele was nearly 300 meters
tall and nearly 30 meters thick. The divine power within Ning’s
body instantly flooded into the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Not a Chaos
treasure?” As soon as Ning sent his divine power into it, he
realized something was wrong. There was no way to bind this treasure.
Ning knew exactly how it felt to bind a treasure, even a Protocosmic
one, but when his divine power flooded into this treasure, he found
the insides to be empty. There was nothing at all for him to bind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, when his
divine power flooded into the two massive characters at the front of
the stone stele, a ripple of information was transmitted straight
into Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventeen.” Ning
instantly understood what the enormous characters meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two words mean
‘seventeen’. What does that mean? Can it mean that there are many
of these stone steles, and that this is the seventeenth?” Ning
guessed. “Right; there are many other characters at the back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body blurred,
then he appeared in the lotus position to one side of the stone
stele. He began to pour a large amount of divine power into the
stele. As his divine power flooded into it, it quickly began to
interact with the countless characters on the other side of the stone
stele. As it did, Ning could sense a tremendous, invisible force
resisting his own power; clearly, to forcibly scan and understand the
information contained within those countless characters was beyond
what his capabilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.” Ning came
to a halt. “The front side only has two characters, whereas the
back side has at least a million. Two characters didn’t give me
much pressure, and I was able to understand them right away, but a
million is far more than what I can handle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone stele was
nearly three hundred meters tall, and its rear was filled with those
tiny, worm-like scribbles. As best as Ning could tell, there was
roughly 1.2 million of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s start from
the top and proceed slowly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to attempt to fill up a few characters with his divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is so slow.”
Ning immediately found the process to be quite taxing. Despite that,
a good amount of information began to fill Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods]…” An extremely ancient technique immediately began to
be transmitted into Ning’s mind. As Ning’s divine power filled
each character, more and more information regarding this technique
entered his mind. Soon, he completely memorized this entire
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It…it’s actually
a cultivation technique.” Ning stared at the stone stele in
astonishment. “And this is just a small part of the top.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The characters on the
stone stele were divided into seven major regions. The first region
had this technique, the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
technique. It actually allows you to divide into eighteen different
bodies.” Ning let out a sigh. “Although Fiendgods can divide into
many different clones, once the clone dies, the part of the soul
within it will die as well. This will result in the soul fragmenting,
and when too much of the soul is destroyed, you will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this
technique…upon mastering the first level, you’ll be able to
perfectly divide the soul into eighteen different spawns. Although
each spawn will have less than a tenth of the power of the original
body, they are all capable of surviving on their own. In addition, if
the other seventeen are destroyed, the final spawn will slowly be
able to recreate the other spawns.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you reach the
second level of this technique, the eighteen spawns will all have the
same level of power as the original body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you master the
third level…the eighteen spawns can merge back into the original
body at any point in time, and the original body can also divide into
those eighteen spawns. When they merge into the original body, the
power of the original body will explosively increase.” Ning sighed
in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he mastered this
technique, it would be as though there were eighteen Ji Ning’s.
Even if he chose to use his original body to fight by itself, his
power would still exponentially increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How monstrous a
technique was this?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that this
is the technique which Youngflame Freak used, and that he was only
able to train to the first level of this technique.” Ning
immediately understood. “I had thought that he trained in a secret
art like the Bloodshadow Incarnation…but it seems he’s actually
training in this unfathomably profound technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had
powerful techniques of its own. The Bloodshadow Incarnation, for
example, guaranteed that so long a single incarnation remained alive,
the others would come back to life as well. However, true experts
would rarely use this technique, because the power of each
incarnation would drop dramatically; it was better to keep the true
body at maximum power instead! Everyone believed that Youngflame
Freak had trained in this technique because he was a coward who
feared death, but who would’ve thought that he actually was in
possession of a technique like this [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]? The
relative weakness of his bodies was only due to the fact that he had
merely trained to the first level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did this
technique come from?” Ning let out a sigh of amazement. “Still…it
will be very hard to truly master this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were detailed
notes regarding this technique. It was easy to gain a basic level of
skill in the technique and master the first stage, but the second
stage was thousands of times more difficult. As for the third stage?
It would be easier to ascend to the heavens than to master it. It
required both talent and luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even Daoist Three Purities was only capable of dividing himself
into the Three Pure Ones. As for the Lord Buddha, he only had his
five major clones! The second level of this technique immediately
allowed for the creation of eighteen clones that were as strong as
the original. This…this was absolutely unearthly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what the
second technique holds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more filled
the stele with his divine power. Instantly, the information
pertaining to the second technique began to leak into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second technique
was named the [Nine Bug Solutions].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
mysterious and marvelous method for cultivating bug-type beasts. Ning
now understood why Youngflame Freak had been able to cultivate and
rear such powerful bugs. Everyone in the Three Realms thought that
Youngflame Freak had received a particular expert’s legacy, as
there were quite a number of experts who specialized in rearing
powerful bug-type beasts. Since Youngflame Freak’s skills in
raising bugs wasn’t excessively amazing, no one paid much attention
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But what the outside
world didn’t know was that the issue was that Youngflame Freak was
too weak and didn’t have access to enough treasures and materials,
which was why he didn’t have the chance to rear any powerful bugs
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique needs
an enormous amount of time and effort. It doesn’t suit me.” Ning
immediately gave up on the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for the third
technique.” Ning slowly began to notice that the further down he
read, the more taxing it became, as the resistive force which filled
the stele seemed to grow in power. What Ning didn’t realize was
that Youngflame Freak himself had only been able to acquire parts of
the first technique and second technique. He had been completely
unable to gain access to any of the other parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was merely a
Celestial Immortal, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak
treated this stone stele as his most valued treasure. He cared about
it far more than the Worldhold Pagoda, and was extremely careful
about it. The reason he had kept it hidden with him in the
Winterherald world was because it was a ‘safe’ place where he was
extremely low-key. By contrast, he was still willing to keep the
Worldhold Pagoda in the Grand Xia…but who would’ve thought that
Ji Ning would end up acquiring it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single
technique is marvelous.” Ning could sense that his divine power was
finding it harder and harder to ‘read’ the meaning of the
characters. By the time he reached the fifth technique, he was
completely unable to make any more progress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try with my
Pure Yang energy.” Unwilling to give up, Ning immediately tested
out his Pure Yang energy, flooding the stone stele with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning discovered, to his
utter amazement, that the Pure Yang energy was clearly much more
effective in reading the characters on the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I might just be able
to acquire all seven of these techniques.” Ning instantly felt a
certain eagerness in his heart. In fact, he had a feeling…that once
he learned all seven techniques, he would perhaps know where this
stone stele came from.

Chapter 24 - The Seven Mighty Techniques
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang energy was
clearly better suited to penetrating these characters on the stone
stele. Ji Ning received the complete fifth technique, the sixth
technique…the seventh technique…!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes began to
turn bloodshot. He was pouring all of his energy and effort into
acquiring these techniques, which had completely stunned him. They
were simply far too incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of these were
comparable to the most supreme of techniques the Three Realms had. As
for some of the others…they surpassed any techniques of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first technique,
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], had already caused Ning to feel extremely
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second technique,
[Nine Bug Solutions], contained unlimited potential. However, since
the storm had already arrived, Ning didn’t have enough time to
meditate on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third technique,
[Sin Armaments], was a technique that was very similar to the
Fiendgod Rites of Bloodforging. This was a technique that absorbed
the hatred and resentment left behind by slain enemies, using them to
forge weapons. These weapons were truly terrifying armaments that
possessed tremendous power. By comparison, the Rites of Bloodforging
was excessively simple and crude in the manner through which it
absorbed the negative energy. [Sin Armaments] was thousands of times
more profound than the Rites of Bloodforging. It allowed weapons to
rise in power far more quickly, and in a more perfect manner. Weapons
created through [Sin Armaments] had much greater potential, and could
even become Chaos weapons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth technique,
[Jewel Talisman], was a technique to create Dao-talismans. It was
extremely complicated. Although Ning had memorized it, he didn’t
understand it whatsoever; clearly, it was incredibly profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth technique,
[Qiankun Reversing Gestalt-Formation], was a formation that worked
together perfectly with the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] technique,
because this was a technique that required eighteen cultivators whose
minds were as one. If one mastered the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]
technique then set down this grand formation, an entire Heaven would
be created that could be used to trap one’s foes. It would be as
though they were trapped someone else’s a major world! This was a
technique that was perfectly suited for defense and for trapping,
rather than attacking. However, due to how profound and abstruse it
was, it would probably take a very long period of time to master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth technique,
[God of Ghosts], was a technique meant for cultivating and raising
ghosts. The soul was the foundation of all life, and the ghosts that
were left behind after one died held limitless potential within them.
The [God of Ghosts] technique allowed one to constantly strengthen
ghosts all the way to the True God level. In fact, there was even a
chance to raise ghosts to have the power of an Elder God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh technique,
[Indestructible Body], was a technique that was similar to the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, compared to
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], this divine ability was even more
incredible. The [Indestructible Body] had a total of six stages;
Empyrean Gods could only train in the first three, while only True
Gods could train in the final three. According to the description of
this divine ability, the first three stages alone were comparable to
the complete [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], while the final three stages,
based on what Ning could tell, would allow the divine body to become
comparable to a supreme Protocosmic spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, the various major powers had joined together to develop the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], with the goal of developing a total of
twelve cycles. Alas, in the end they were only able to complete nine
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This [Indestructible
Body] technique, however, had achieved what those major powers had
aspired to. But of course, it required an enormous amount of magic
treasures. The Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] required an
astonishing amount of Great Firmament Immortal pills. As for the
[Indestructible Body]? There were few even amongst True Immortals and
Daofathers who could absorb the necessary cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven mighty
techniques, each of which was astonishing. [Sin Armaments] and
[Indestructible Body] were specially prepared for Fiendgod Body
Refiners; the sinblades would generally be used in close combat,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Nine Bug Solutions]
and [Jewel Talisman] were meant for Ki Refiners to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the remaining
three techniques, both Ki Refiners and Fiendgod Body Refiners could
execute them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, with great
difficult, Ning finished reading the characters of the seventh
technique. All seven of them were now memorized in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a tremendous
stroke of karmic luck. These definitely are not techniques that were
created by the major powers of the Three Realms. Many of the
described materials don’t even exist in the Three Realms. For
example, the [God of Ghosts] is probably completely unusable. The
[Indestructible Body] will also be hard to train to a high level,
because the treasures described are not present here.” And yet,
Ning understood…“Despite all that, these techniques are still
incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alien Outsiders
in the primordial chaos…they truly are incredible.” Ning let out
a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alien Outsiders who
had arrived in the Three Realms, such as the terrifying Lord of All
Things, were capable of doing things like secretly manipulating the
Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld into a collision course.
In addition, the Lord of All Things had been able to create golems
and Queen Mother armies that were comparable to the full might of the
entire Pangu Chaosworld. From this, one could tell how terrifying the
alien Outsiders could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s gaze
landed upon the divine runes engraved on the edges of the stone
stele. “Just now, I only focused on the characters. I wonder what
these divine runes hold within them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a certain
excitement in his heart. He had the feeling that the power and aura
of the stone stele primarily came from the divine runes. The
characters didn’t hold any power in them, but the divine runes held
tremendous auras of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed
the stone stele to be sent to a side hall within the Starseizing
Manor, then sent his Pure Yang energy into it from afar. That way,
even if something dangerous happened…given that the Starseizing
Manor was a nigh-unbreakable Protocosmic spirit-treasure, he should
be able to stay safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is hard to
fill.” His Pure Yang energy slowly filling the divine runes, Ning
instantly began to sense a connection to that exalted aura of
supremacy, as well as how hard the runes were to penetrate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep going. Keep
going. Just a little more. Just a liiiiittle more…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…all of the
divine runes on the stone stele were completely filled with Ning’s
Pure Yang energy. Although the characters had been rather tiring, by
comparison they weren’t that hard. These divine runes had actually
caused Ning’s vision to go dim; he had used up almost all of his
heartforce before just barely being able to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant when he
successfully finished pouring his energy into the runes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An inconceivable aura
of power exploded forth from the stone stele. The divine runes lit up
with dazzling golden light, carrying an aura that was so exalted, it
was even superior to that of the Dao of the Heavens. As it exploded
outwards, it followed the path of Ning’s unleashed Pure Yang energy
to instantly arrive at Ning himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a feeling that
this exalted, mighty aura was something which no one in the Three
Realms aside from the legendary Mother Nuwa and Pangu were capable of
matching. They, too, were supposedly superior to the Heavenly Daos
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The exalted aura
completely surrounded Ning. In the face of its might, Ning was like
an infant, completely unable to fight bac.k
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura of power
rapidly flew back into the stone stele, and the golden light covering
the countless divine runes slowly dimmed and faded to a normal color.
It just stood there like an ordinary stone stele…except Ji Ning had
already disappeared from the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” The giant
yellow bear appeared, absolutely frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he knew was that Ji
Ning had been analyzing that stone stele. As for what mysteries the
stone stele contained? The bear had no idea. However, upon sensing
his master disappear, he had naturally panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine.”
Ning’s voice rang out within the giant yellow bear’s mind. Now
that he had completely bound the manor, he had a true master-servant
connection to the giant yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurry region of
chaos, merely a few hundred meters in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere within this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?” Ning
was extremely puzzled. He could, however, still sense the panicking
giant yellow bear outside, and so he hurriedly consoled the bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that…?”
Ning saw two figures fly towards him from far way, each of whom had
auras of tremendous power. They had swarthy black skin and were many
meters tall. Ning immediately grew guarded as he saw them approach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After arriving, the two
figures…simultaneously fell to their knees, then prostrated
themselves on the ground. “Respectful greetings to you, Overseer!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 25 - Tremendous Fortune
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked at the
two prostrating figures, his heart clenching. “It seems my blunder
has resulted in them believing me to be the ‘Overseer’. I have to
be very careful. The first thing I should do is get a sense as to
what an ‘Overseer’ does. I can’t let them see through me;
that’ll put me in grave danger.” That exalted aura he had sensed
earlier told him that he was a very weak figure, compared to the
power of the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems they are
very respectful to me; their status should be lower than mine.”
Ning pondered for a moment, then said, “The two of you, report your
names.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This humble one is
Eastcricket.” The taller man was the first to respond respectfully.
His voice was low and deep, and seemed quite honest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This humble one is
Westbat,” the pudgier one said. “The two of us have been awaiting
you, Lord Overseer, for three full chaos cycles. Ever since we were
created, we’ve been diligently working here at Prisonworld 17.
Without you here, Lord Overseer, we’ve been quite nervous and
restless. We were worried that something unexpected had happened to
this prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
clenched. Three chaos cycles? A ‘chaos cycle’ had to be a unit of
time…and from the sound of it, it was a very long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being created?
Were not they living creatures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prisonworld 17? As the
‘Overseer’…was he supposed to be in charge of this prison?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has anything
unexpected happened in this Prisonworld?” Ning casually followed
their line of conversation. He needed to ask as many questions as he
could and learn more information from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were blessed by
your good fortune, and so nothing has happened during the past three
chaos cycles. It won’t be so easy for the imprisoned criminals to
cause any problems!” The pudgy Westbat hurriedly added, “I knew
that you have to be busy, milord. The various duties of the
Prisonworld can be left to the two of us for handling. If there
really is a major event, we’ll immediately notify you. All you need
to do is then report it to His Majesty. You can spend your time
touring the Prisonworld, or you can quietly train by yourself. If
there’s anything you need, just inform us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Report it to
His Majesty…” Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Majesty?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of which kingdom? Could
it be that this stone stele belonged to a particular nation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me about the
various matters, great and small, that have occurred during the past
three chaos cycles,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall Eastcricket
blinked at Ning, them mused to himself, “How long would it take to
describe all the events that occurred over the course of three chaos
cycles? How bored is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In contrast, chubby
Westbat grew excited. “Milord, allow me. Uh…shall I start from
the time when the last Lord Overseer left, or…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me a bit about
the previous Lord Overseer, then speak about the past three chaos
cycles.” Ning wanted to learn more, but he was afraid of exposing
himself. Thus, he was very careful with his words. These two jailors
seemed to be very respectful to him, but Ning still had a strange
feeling about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, ever since
his Pure Yang energy filled the divine runes, he had gained a strange
sort of control over this chaotic region. In fact, he could easily
leave it if he chose. And yet…he didn’t have any direct control
over these two jailors. Clearly, they had to have been produced by
this mysterious ‘Dominion’ and only answered to the dictates of
the Dominion. If they were to discover that Ning was a foe, they
would probably attack him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah…well, the
previous Lord Overseer would chat with us when he was bored. Now, it
could just be that he was bragging for the sake of bragging, but he
claimed to be the son of an Elder God, and that the only reason he
had been punished to serve as an Overseer for a chaos cycle was
because he had run afoul of the law.” Westbat mused to himself, “I
don’t know if he was just bragging or not, but based on my own
judgment, I think he was telling the truth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
Overseers are all core members of our Pangaea chaos-kingdom. After
all, even though being forced to stay here in solitude for a full
chaos cycle is technically a form of punishment, it also allows the
offender to learn those seven supreme techniques. In addition, the
offender is even allowed to enjoy one of the bottles of chaos nectar
which Prisonworld 17 is able to refine from the primordial chaos
around us. This is actually a great benefit! Ordinary Immortals would
be willing to spend a full chaos cycle in solitude to gain a bottle
of chaos nectar or to learn the seven supreme techniques, but they
wouldn’t even have a chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos nectar?”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] was divided into three stages. The first stage was very
easy to learn, but the second stage was thousands of times more
difficult, because it required one to be able to transform into
eighteen mighty clones, each of which was as powerful as the original
body. Even the soul had to be identical in power. It was easy to
train in divine power or Immortal energy, but to duplicate the soul
eighteen times while maintaining the same level of power was
incredibly difficult. It required the assistance of precious
supportive treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar was
incomparably precious. If he had chaos nectar, he would be able to
master the second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Chaos
nectar.” Jailor Westbad said hurriedly, “A bottle of chaos
nectar, based on the experiences of the past Lord Overseers, is
generally enough to allow mastery of the second stage of the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the chaos
nectar?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The previous Lord
Overseer took the chaos nectar back with him to offer it to His
Majesty. However, during the past three chaos cycles, Prison-World 17
has continued to distill primordial chaos, accumulating quite a bit.
The two of us have been working hard on this task. Given that it’s
been three chaos cycles since we’ve been contacted…we have a
total of eighteen bottles. The nineteenth bottle isn’t full yet; we
still need to spend some time and fill it up,” Westbat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give them to me,”
Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chubby Jailor
Westbat was startled. He hesitated momentarily, then waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a total of
eighteen black bottles appeared before him, hovering in the air. The
ancient surfaces of the bottles were covered with divine runes. They
were clearly extraordinary items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord,” Westbat
said hurriedly, “Milord, you’ll be here for at least a full chaos
cycle. You are only permitted to use a single bottle; no matter what,
don’t use more than that. His Majesty knows exactly how much we are
able to harvest. If you use too much, you’ll probably run into
trouble. Chaos nectar is extremely valuable…generally, we only give
it to the Lord Overseer when he finishes his tour of duty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relax. I’m not
suicidal,” Ning chuckled. He waved his arm, collecting the eighteen
bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Westbat hurriedly
laughed ingratiatingly. “Right, right, right. You have an exalted
status, milord; naturally, you won’t act rashly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eheh. Are there any
other treasures here in Prisonworld 17?” Ning’s eyes seemed to be
shining right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” The
chubby Jailor Westbat shook his head repeatedly. He had served quite
a few Overseers, and he knew that all of them had special statuses.
All of them were core members of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom, which was
why they were sent to such an important location as this. Although it
was nominally a punishment, it was also a great boon. There were many
of them who acquired chaos nectar, then greedily desired other things
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is
nothing else. This is just a Prisonworld with many prisoners,” the
chubby jailor said. “If you are talented enough to get something
out of the prisoners, that’s entirely your business. However, all
of the prisoners are filled with hatred, and many of them are
incredibly powerful; I imagine that not only will they not give you
anything, they’ll try to kill you. If you really want to interact
with the prisoners, milord, I urge you to hurry up and master the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]. That way, with eighteen clones, you at
least won’t be at any risk of death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prisoners?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue telling me
about Overseer duties, as well as the various events that have
occurred during the past three chaos cycles. I’m actually quite
bored right now. Ugh…a full chaos cycle! It’ll feel like
forever,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please permit me to
elaborate,” the chubby Jailor Westbat said excitedly. He loved to
talk, but Eastcricket was a stuffy gourd who was always silent. This
caused Westbat quite a bit of irritation, and he would often go
chatting with some of the prisoners. Many of the prisoners wanted to
kill him, but fortunately for him he always stayed outside of the
protective formations, preventing them from injuring him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half of the
prisoners of Prisonworld 17 absolutely hated this chattering,
prattering jailor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last Lord
Overseer had a rather foul attitude. In my opinion, he had indeed
been spoiled rotten by an Elder God. As soon as he arrived…” The
chubby Jailor Westbat began to narrate nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
smiled and listened in a very ‘relaxed’ way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Relaxed? He wasn’t
relaxed at all! But he knew very well that his acquisition of the
stone stele was a stroke of tremendous karmic fortune. The greater a
stroke of karmic fortune, the more careful one had to be. Otherwise,
one might end up with nothing, or worse!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning continued to
listen, he began to understand more and more. An entire world had
indeed been placed within this stone stele, and from the sound of it
the world was extremely vast! This was a place where many of the
criminals of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangaea
chaos-kingdom was an extremely powerful kingdom. The most powerful
figure was the King of Pangaea, an exceptionally formidable and
powerful figure. The stone stele which held this prisonworld had been
created by the King of Pangaea, and there were a total of thirty-six
of them. The thirty-six stone stele prisonworlds would naturally join
together into the shockingly powerful ‘Nine-Layered Heaven Chaining
Formation’, making it incredibly hard for enemies to enter. Only
members of their own kingdom could enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the thirty-six
stone steles had seven mighty techniques engraved upon them, for a
total of 252 techniques. These techniques had all been left behind by
the King of Pangaea. Although these weren’t the supreme techniques
which the King of Pangaea had used to dominate his opponents, they
were still some of the best techniques he had to offer. Every single
Overseer would have the opportunity to learn the seven techniques on
their respective stone steles, but they wouldn’t be permitted to
learn from any of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmm…hmm…Pangaea
chaos-kingdom? From its name, it has to be a kingdom located within
the primordial chaos,” Ning mused to himself. “The primordial
chaos truly is an absolutely amazing place. In the past, there have
been quite a few incursions by alien Outsiders into our Three Realms.
The primordial chaos is vast and infinite, capable of giving birth to
many True Gods, Elder Gods, and even figures like Pangu. It makes
sense that a nation like the Pangaea chaos-kingdom would exist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…judging
from what these jailors said, the ‘Nine-Layered Heaven Chaining
Formation’ which these thirty-six stone steles are a part of is
nothing more than a joke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stone stele
ended up in Youngflame Freak’s hands during the Primordial Era, and
now it is in my hands. Its always been by itself for these countless
years. I imagine that the formation was long ago destroyed, resulting
in the stone steles being scattered apart. I wonder what this stone
stele experienced, for it to have ended up here in the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
surprised and delighted, he was still cautious. The Three Realms had
often battled against alien Outsiders such as Rahu or the
even-more-powerful Lord of All Things, but had killed all of them.
Most likely, many in the Three Realms hac acquired some of the
treasures or supreme techniques of the alien Outsiders. Ning had
merely acquired a single such treasure…albeit, his seemed to be
quite impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
listen ‘relaxedly’ for some time, then said with a laugh,
“Alright, you can stop for now.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
go patrol the prisonworld,” Ji Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
two jailors respectfully assented to the order, then began to fly
back the way they came. Far away, there was a blurry spatial door.
Upon entering it, the two disappeared from Ning’s senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only person left in
this region was Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position. Below him was the ‘edges’ of this chaos region.
Although it was invisible, it was enough to support Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos nectar?
Distilled from primordial chaos? I’ve never even heard of such a
thing in the Three Realms.” Ning waved his hand, producing a black
bottle. “A single bottle of chaos nectar is enough to train the
second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]? But from the sound of
it, this chaos nectar is incredibly valuable. Generally speaking, in
the Pangaea chaos-kingdom, only Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
are allowed to enjoy this nectar. Aside from them, only some people
with special statuses will be occasionally bestowed a bit of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Ancestral Immortals’
was a term of power from the Pangaea chaos-kingdom. As far as Ning
could tell, it referred to ‘Daofathers’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The language of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom was incredibly similar to that of the human
language of the Three Realms. The words were very similar to each
other, and even the pronunciation was similar. Previously, when the
torrent of information regarding the seven mighty techniques had
entered Ning’s mind, he could hear echoes of a great Dao, allowing
him to easily understand their language. In truth, it could even be
treated as a mere human dialect of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A person assigned to
be an Overseer would have to have a high level of status in the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom. They would be ‘punished’ to stand guard
for a chaos cycle, but would then acquire a bottle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now knew exactly
how long a chaos cycle was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chatty Westbat had
spoken for three days and three nights. He had provided much
information, allowing Ning to hypothesize even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos cycles…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They referred to the
natural cycles every chaosworld would go through. Its birth, the slow
passage of time, its eventual aging, and then its final destruction.
This extremely long period of time was known as a ‘chaos cycle’!
But of course, there were some chaosworlds which were attacked and
destroyed by outside forces during their prime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
primordial world of Pangu was a chaosworld that had collided with the
Seamless Chaosworld, then experienced a battle that caused its
destruction. Still, in the end, the destruction of the Pangu
Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld had resulted in the birth of
the new world, the ‘Three Realms’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prisonworld 17?”
Ning glanced at the distant spatial doorway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now knew that once
he left this region, he would enter Prisonworld 17. This was one of
the thirty-six great prisonworlds that were used to hold the
prisoners of the ancient Pangaea chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos nectar is
extremely valuable and rare; it’s hard to say if it even exists
anywhere else in the Three Realms. I absolutely cannot waste such a
precious treasure.” Ning pondered on what to do next. As for the
jailor’s instructions for him to only use a single bottle, Ning
didn’t give a damn. Who knew in what corner of the primordial chaos
the Pangaea chaos-kingdom was even located? In fact, it might’ve
been destroyed long ago! And of course, Ning himself was merely
feigning allegiance to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All eighteen bottles
would naturally belong to himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
the jailor said, all of the Overseers would choose to use their
bottle of chaos nectar to train in the second stage of the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods].” Ning nodded. “The Overseers were all core
members of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom. They should have known exactly
how valuable chaos nectar was. If they chose to use it for this
technique, then it should be worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’ll be my
choice as well. First, I’ll train in [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s primary issue
was that he knew far too little about chaos nectar. Chaos nectar was
gathered by the vast prisonworlds, which had created incomparably
complicated formations to harvest it from the primordial chaos. Every
single chaos cycle, only a total of six bottles would be harvested!
In addition, there wasn’t necessarily anyone in the entire Three
Realms who was capable of setting up such a complicated formation.
Most likely, only Mother Nuwa, who had established her own Nuwa
world, would be able to do so. No matter how Ning looked at it, it
seemed as though acquiring more chaos nectar would be extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chaos nectar of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom would generally go to the King of Pangaea, who
would occasionally bestow a bit to his subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single bottle
used would represent an irrecovable expenditure. He had to be
judicious and sparing in its use. Perhaps in the future, he might
discover an important effect or use for it! But of course, the second
stage of [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] was absolutely shocking in power.
Ning deeply desired to train in it, and so he started to do so
immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blurry chaos region
was only a few hundred meters wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although this region
of primordial chaos is very small, it’s extraordinary marvelous.”
Ning stared at his surroundings. “Earlier, when I was outside, I
couldn’t find anything when I sent my divine power into the stone
stele. The stone stele holds this chaos region within it, as well as
the prisonworld. I had to activate the divine runes before I was
drawn inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The strangest thing
is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
this place is not under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning was at a
formidable level of power. He could vaguely sense how the Heavenly
Daos of the Three Realms functioned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To surpass the
jurisdiction of the Heavenly Daos was possible if one went into the
vast Void. Although a Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos was present
there, the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos of the Void was different
from that of the Three Realms, even though the ‘rules’ were the
same, as they belonged to different regions. Similarly, the
primordial chaos itself held a Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos, as
did this stone stele, but the Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms did
not have any sway outside the Three Realms or inside the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stone stele is
clearly inside my Starseizing Manor, but it isn’t subject to the
dicates of the Three Realms. It seems that the major power who
created this stone stele is also a figure who has surpassed the
Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After coming to this
conclusion, Ning no longer thought any further on the matter. Whoosh!
A green jade bottle appeared within his hands, with some Pure Yang
Immortal pills located inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stage of
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] is very easy. All I need to do is use up
some Pure Yang Immortal pills.” Ning opened the stopper to the
green jade bottle, then placed it to one side as he began to train.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Criss-crossing lines of
gold began to appear all over Ning’s body. Slowly, golden runes
began to take form. As more time passed, the golden runes became more
and more numerous. In the blink of an eye, a golden rune-covered
kasaya seemed to have appeared over Ning’s body! A certain aura
began to emanate from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many golden runes
began to connect to each other in an organized way, linking together
into lines that began to ripple and flow. The lines of golden runes
thus began to merge into each other in an extremely marvelous way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange, nameless
aura began to drift out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! As time flowed
out, the lines of golden runes finally completed their fusion, having
transformed into a single, enormous divine rune. This enormous divine
rune had completely covered Ning’s body…and then, with a swoosh,
it went straight inside Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, a miracle began
to happen…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My truesoul…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a sensation
akin to intoxication. Everything felt blurry, but he could still
sense that his truesoul was slowly being divided into
halves…thirds…quarters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul was beginning
to split apart as well. As he felt his body grow low on energy, Ning
immediately began to consume some Pure Yang Immortal pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This dream-like state
persisted for a period of time. Then…whoosh. Seventeen rays of
light suddenly shot out from Ning, each of which then transformed
into a white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
white-robed youths all sat there in the lotus position within the
chaos region. Their auras were absolutely identical, and their power
was the same as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually became
independent, self-sustaining bodies. Every single one of them has a
perfect truesoul and soul. They even have Pure Yang Jindan’s within
their body.” Ning was absolutely delighted and shocked. The
eighteen clones shared memories together, as they were fundamentally
the same person. However, the death of one wouldn’t have any impact
on the other seventeen at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, thanks to
the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], a slain clone could be remade.
However, the cost to remake another soul and another Pure Yang Jindan
would be quite large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning hadn’t
paid much of a price to train to the first stage. This was because
Ning’s true body had essentially had its power divided by eighteen
to create those seventeen additional bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely
identical. Even the divine tattoos are identical.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Ji Ning’s
simultaneously stared at their respective palms; each of them had
Starseizing Tattoos on their hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Empyrean Gods
created clones, their power would only be slightly affected, and they
would still have their divine abilities. The fatal flaw of those
clones, however, was that their souls weren’t stand-alone. If too
many clones died, the soul would be tattered and break apart. Ning,
however, didn’t have to face this danger…but his power did
decrease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to train the
second stage.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately pulling
out a bottle of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
white-robed youths all sat down in the lotus position, forming into
an enormous circle with the chaos nectar at the center of the circle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Drip. Drip. Drip.
Droplets of chaos nectar flew out from the black bottle. Although
each dropped looked translucent, it was as though they held entire
worlds within them. Tiny little bubbles occasionally appeared within
each drop, occasionally breaking apart and popping. The little
‘worlds’ within those bubbles were similarly being born and
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An inconceivably
powerful aura of life emanated from those chaos droplets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raw power alone,
each drop was perhaps only comparable to a Great Firmament Immortal
pill, but the chaos nectar seemed to hold everything within them.
Truesoul, soul, heartforce, Immortal energy, divine power…all types
of energy seemed to be hidden within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
could give birth to worlds. It could create countless living
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar was
distilled and extracted from the primordial chaos. It was
incomparably marvelous and incomparably valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One drop of chaos
nectar after another flew out, moving towards the eighteen
white-robed youths. When the chaos nectar entered Ning’s body, Ning
felt an unprecedented cold sensation fill it. Even his soul itself
felt chilled. However, this icy feeling was quite comfortable, and he
felt more refreshed and awake than he ever had before. Every part of
his body, from his muscles and his flesh to his soul, felt alive and
refreshed, as though he had just been bathed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to apply the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] technique in guiding the
chaos nectar to take affect in the necessary manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First the soul, then
the Pure Yang Jindan…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately began
to grow at high speed, like a sapling growing into a tree. Even
Ning’s divine power was rapidly increasing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The auras of all
eighteen white-robed youths were strengthening at a shockingly fast
pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the first
stage of this powerful technique was easy to learn precisely because
it involved dividing the power of the true body into eighteen
different bodies. The reason why the second stage was thousands of
times harder was precisely because it involved using different types
of extremely rare items to rebuild the lost power…but finding items
that could replenish the soul and heartforce was incredibly
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stage not
only had high material requirements, it also required a certain level
of insight, making it even harder to train. But once one succeeded,
the eighteen clones would be able to once more merge together,
resulting in a simply shocking increase in power. In truth, there had
been many in the Pangaea chaos-kingdom who had acquired this
technique, but aside from the King of Pangaea himself, no one had
ever been able to train to the third stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chaos region was
completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bottle of chaos
nectar had long ago been used up. At the very bottom of the black
bottle, a little bit of remaning chaos nectar could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” The
eighteen white-robed youths simultaneously opened their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day
forth…I finally have the strength I need to truly battle against
the Seamless Gate.” Ning could finally sense that the terrifying
pressure the Seamless Gate had brought him had begun to lessen.
Finally, he had a true chance to rescue his senior apprentice-sister.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_27___Prisonworld"></A>
Chapter 27 - Prisonworld
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of value, the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] was comparable to the other six
techniques. However, thanks to this bottle of chaos nectar, Ji Ning
had been able to train to the second level of the technique, causing
his body to undergo a fundamental change in quality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually a
bit left over.” Ning waved his hand, causing the black bottle to
fly into it. The drops of chaos nectar were clearly visible at the
base of the bottle. “Each bottle holds a total of ninety-nine
drops. There are actually twenty-two left. According to what Jailor
Westbat said, the previous Overseers would all use up nearly an
entire battle. It seems as though my strength is slightly lacking,
compared to the previous Overseers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the more chaos nectar would be needed to train to the second
stage of the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price of training
the first stage and creating eighteen clones was having one’s
strength lowered. The price of training the second stage lay in
consuming chaos nectar to quickly return back to one’s original
level of power. Thus, the more powerful one was, the more chaos
nectar would be needed. For example, the Jindan and the soul which
True Gods and Daofathers possessed were far more powerful than
Ning’s, and so they would need far more chaos nectar as well. This,
too, had been recorded within the details of the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The generations of
Overseers were only permitted to assume their position after showing
that they were capable of ‘reading’ the entire stone stele. Ning
had just barely succeeded, but had still successfully become an
Overseer. This meant his level of power was still quite close to that
of the previous Overseers. Clearly, the previous Overseers hadn’t
reached the True God or Daofather level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prisonworld…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seventeen
clones remained seated, pondering the remaining six techniques. One
of them, however, arose and walked out towards the spatial gateway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon passing through
the gateway, the world seemed to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was now in a wide,
vast world. At the very peak of a ten thousand kilometer mountain, a
white-robed youth appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is a
prisonworld…?” Ning saw that this vast world was dark and blurry.
There were no stars, no sun, no moon. Countless divine runes could be
seen swimming through the skies like dragons. These golden divine
runes caused the skies to glitter, perpetually casting the vast earth
in dim light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spread out.”
Standing atop the peak of the towering mountain, Ning willed his
heartforce to emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His heartforce
instead spread out in every direction. Ning did not dare to release
his coresense in this region, where so many prisoners were located,
for fear of suffering an attack! Comparatively speaking, using
heartforce was much safer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, his
heartforce spread out to cover an area that was at least three times
the size of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, there was a
filthy-looking old man who was leaning against a stone cliff. His
legs were shackled together, and the shackles emanated strange,
mysterious ripples of power. It was precisely because of these
shackles that he had been imprisoned here for more than ten chaos
cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce…? It
seems that the new Overseer has arrived. The Overseers are all young
fellows. This one has fairly strong heartforce, at least.” The
filthy-looking old man raised his head, a green light emanating from
his eyes. Instantly, a surge of powerful heartforce swept out to
cover an area of a thousand kilometers. As for the heartforce which
Ning had sent into the region, it was completely surrounded and
smothered by this second surge of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance,
there was a wild dog who was lying on the ground. The wild dog’s
fur and skin was damaged so badly that his black bones could be seen
in some places. The wild dog blinked. “This kid really doesn’t
know his own limits. That old bastard, Pangaea, is increasingly lax
when sending out his Overseers. Doesn’t he warn these kids?
Still…his heartforce is much stronger than that of the previous
Overseer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything within a
thousand kilometers suddenly turned dark. Even the surrounding space
trembled slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still atop the distant
mountain peak, Ning’s face suddenly turned ashen. He gritted his
teeth. “Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Ning
forcibly severed off part of the heartforce which he had sent out. He
treated it as though he had shot out an arrow with heartforce,
completely severing it from himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How
terrifying…b-b-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after breaking the
connection did the fear hit Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The region my
heartforce was able to cover had to be just a tiny portion of this
prisonworld. The most terrifying figures within this region were that
old man and that wild dog.” Ning swallowed, hard. “That old man
had to be at the Daofather level, while the wild dog should be at the
Elder God level. That old man’s heartforce is merely at the fourth
stage as well, but he’s far more powerful than me in using
techniques to apply it. He was actually able to instantly trap me in
an illusion. Fortunately, both of us are at the fourth stage of
heartforce, which is why I was able to forcibly sever the
connection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for that wild
dog…his divine ability is simply incredible. He was able to devour
my heartforce in the blink of an eye.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood that those two figures were definitely not people he could
mess with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The area I scanned
also contained eighteen True Gods, thirty-three Pure Yang True
Immortals, seventy-one Empyrean Gods, and ninety-six Celestial
Immortals.” Ning did some quick calculations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The auras of the True
Gods were as powerful as expected. The Pure Yang True Immortals also
gave Ning a sense of tremendous danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Empyrean Gods
and Celestial Immortals shouldn’t be too dangerous.” Ning
pondered for another moment. “Right. I’ll choose a Celestial
Immortal as my first contact. Celestial Immortals are the weakest. I
should be able to discover quite a few secrets from them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two jailors were
nothing more than constructs; they didn’t understand any
cultivation techniques at all. The prisoners here, however, did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down within
his Voidboat. The Voidboat transformed into a streak of light,
rapidly advancing through the dark prisonworld. Ning intentionally
kept more than a thousand kilometers away from the prisoners, because
every single prisoner was surrounded by complicated formations that
were a thousand kilometers around them. These formations were meant
to subdue the prisoners and prevent their techniques from going
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to
tear through the space in the prisonworld, nor was there any way to
engage in spatial teleportation. The only choice was to slowly fly
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It usually took the two
jailors more than 120,000 years to complete a full inspection of all
the prisoners in the prisonworld. From this, one could tell how vast
this world truly was. But of course, this was also a testament to how
slow the jailors were. As constructs, they were able to absorb enough
energy from the world to stay alive, but their flying speed was
ridiculously slow. If they had a Voidboat like Ning did, they would
be much, much faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew for half a
day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here it is.” Ning
put away the Voidboat, then landed within a valley.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Celestial
Immortal is right up ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he walked through
the valley, Ning moved hundreds of kilometers with each step. He
quickly arrived at the margins of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blurry formation
barrier covered the region like a giant dome. The prisoner was
completely unable to step past the formation barrier. However, the
barrier was only effective against the prisoner; Ning and the two
jailors could enter and exit as they pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning took a
single step forward. The barrier didn’t harm Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more sent out
his heartforce, using it to encompass this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, there was a
youth dressed in tattered clothes who was seated in the lotus
position. The youth had a pair of black shackles around his feet. The
chains attached to the black shackles stretched off into the
distance, disappearing into an empty region as though they had
emerged from it. The black shackles were absolutely terrifying; once
they were attached, there was no way to remove them at all. Not even
Elder Gods could do it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the black
shackles looked like they were attached to the legs, in truth they
bound the soul and the truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, faint
footsteps could be heard off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The youth
dressed in tattered clothes blurrily opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been far too
long. He had been here far, far too long, so long that even the magic
treasure clothes he wore had been reduced to a tattered state. In
truth, all he had to do was use a bit of energy and he would be able
to instantly repair them, but there was no way to absorb any energy
whatsoever within the prisonworld. All any of them could do was rely
on the original amount they had to sustain themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had committed a
grave crime, so great that not even his school could save him. His
master had given him many spirit-pills, so that he might live longer
within this prisonworld. His master had said to him, “Goodhill, I’m
unable to save you. Be sparing with these spirit-pills. You’ll only
be able to survive within the prisonworld by relying on your own
Immortal energy, but once it is used up, once the spirit-pills are
used up, you will die! Only if you manage to stay alive will you be
able to escape. I’ll definitely help you and come up with a way to
save you, so you have to hold on. No matter what, don’t kill
yourself. Hold on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone’s finally
come. It’s been far, far too long.” A look of hope was in the
youth’s eyes. “Am I going to be released?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was this hope which
had sustained him for three chaos cycles, which kept him going even
now. He had been extremely sparing with every drop of energy, and
fortunately his master had provided him with many spirit-pills.
However, by now he had already used up the majority of them; most
likely, he would only be able to hold on for another chaos cycle, at
which point he would succumb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The youth
looked at the white-robed figure. “His aura…True Immortal?
Wait…why is he…so weak?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
skeletal-looking youth. This youth had a human-like appearance, but
he was too skinny. Still, Ning’s heartforce had discovered that
every single prisoner seemed to be extremely gaunt, as though they
were ordinary mortals that were starved to the brink of death. No…not
even starving mortals would be as ridiculously gaunt as them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder God in the
shape of a wild dog, for example…he had been starved so badly that
his very skin had broken apart, revealing his black bones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must be the new
Overseer.” The youth looked at him. “I am a Celestial Immortal,
but an Overseer has actually come to visit me…are you going to
release me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release you?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why didn’t you
bring the talisman of command? Without it, you won’t be able to
open these shackles.” The youth shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his own head
as well. “I don’t have it. I have no way to release you.” Not
even Elder Gods could break these shackles, to say nothing of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was stunned.
He stared at Ning in amazement. “Y-you…you aren’t of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom! Who are you? How did you enter this
prisonworld? What happened to the Pangaea chaos-kingdom?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the Overseer
which His Majesty sent,” Ning said, looking at the youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t deny it.”
The youth shook his head. “If you came from our Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, if you were sent by His Majesty, then you would
definitely know that His Majesty would personally send an Elder God
or Ancestral Immortal to open the shackles. Even if you did have the
command talisman, you still wouldn’t be able to open the shackles.
But just now, when I asked you about opening the shackles with the
command talisman, you didn’t express any puzzlement at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t revealed
anything in front of those two golems…but as soon as he interacted
with an actual intelligent being, a Celestial Immortal, he had
immediately revealed himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning didn’t
panic at all. When he had first entered, he had been worried about
his true identity being revealed, but after chatting with Westbat for
so long, Ning realized that this stone stele was a very special
treasure, much like his Starseizing Manor. It contained many
formations and restrictions within it, but he now truly was the
master of the stone stele. As for the two golems, they were nothing
more than laborers. Perhaps they weren’t weak, but they would
never, ever be able to leave the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, could
leave the stone stele world whenever he so chose. And so, he was no
longer worried about any danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you suspect
my identity? Why did you test me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, what has
happened to the Pangaea chaos-kingdom?!” The youth asked
frantically.
</P>

Chapter 28 - Celestial Immortal Goodhill
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth stared at Ji
Ning, his eyes filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was destroyed,”
Ning replied. Even if it wasn’t destroyed, the thirty-six stone
steles had been split up. Given how long this one had been within the
Three Realms, there was likely no way the Pangaea chaos-kingdom would
ever find it again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Destroyed?
Destroyed. But…how…? Princess…Master…n-no…” The youth
finally broke down. He had resolutely stood firm for three full chaos
cycles because of that unyielding desire in his heart. Three full
chaos cycles! There had been many True Gods who had felt despair due
to solitude and killed themselves, but he, a mere Celestial Immortal,
had been able to persevere for so many years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was your people.
You wiped out our Pangaea chaos-kingdom…you destroyed
everything…took everything from me…n-no…” The youth went
crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go DIEEEEEEE!”
Hundreds of streaks of light suddenly exploded forth from the youth’s
body. The streaks of light swirled around him, and then an enormous,
jade-green sword-shadow suddenly appeared, chopping down towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been fairly
calm, because all of this was as he had expected, and the person
before him was merely a Celestial Immortal. Upon seeing the attack,
however, Ning was truly stunned. The enormous jade-green sword-shadow
carried so much power that his heart clenched. This wasn’t an
attack which Celestial Immortals were capable of. In fact, not even
every Pure Yang True Immortal was as powerful as this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!
[Starseizing Hand]!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
hesitate at all. He immediately executed the [Starseizing Hand]
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous palm,
glowing with blurry light, smashed downwards towards the giant
jade-green sword-shadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The two collided.
Shockwaves spread outwards from the collision, causing the earth to
tremble and crack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but be knocked several steps backwards by the collision. As for the
youth, he still stood there, eyes completely bloodshot as he stared
crazily at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be? You
are merely a Celestial Immortal. How can you be this powerful? This
is impossible.” Ning was completely stunned. This outcome had
completely turned his world upside-down. After using the [Starseizing
Hand], he could be considered a supreme Empyrean God. Why, then, was
he put at a disadvantage when colliding against that sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, DIE! GO
DIE!!!” The youth had gone completely mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to suppress him in order to understand what is going on.” Ning
unleashed his full power. “[Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same technique, the
[Starseizing Hand]…but this time, Ning’s powerful fourth-stage
heartforce was completely activated at full power. The power of the
[Starseizing Hand] instantly increased once more. Most likely, it was
comparable to a full-strength arrow from the divine archers of the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous palm
smashed downwards with unearthly powerful. It was markedly and
visibly far more powerful than before. When the Celestial Immortal’s
enormous jade-green sword-shadow chopped against it, there was a
sudden explosion, followed by the sword-shadow instantly breaking
apart. The giant palm, however, continued to chop downwards. The y
outh wanted to dodge, but the giant palm made a sudden grabbing
motion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! It seized the
youth, capturing the youth within itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fourth stage
heartforce?” The youth stared at Ning, laughing like a madman, his
laughter tinged with desolate grief. “So what if your heartforce is
at the fourth stage? You are such a weak True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak! How could a
Celestial Immortal like you be so powerful?” Ning stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…I’m not
powerful, you are just puny!” The youth stared at Ning. “I would
never have thought that the Pangaea chaos-world would be destroyed
and that this prisonworld would end up in the hands of someone as
weak as you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Answer me!” Ning’s
giant palm clenched around the youth as he said coldly, “How can a
Celestial Immortal be as strong as you? Why did you say I am weak?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s too late…too
late. Even if you found out, it’s still too late.” The youth
truly seemed gripped by madness as he giggled, “But I still refuse
to tell you. Not gonna tell you! Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. He could
sense that this youth truly seemed to have gone crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you tell me, not
only will I spare you, I can give you what you want,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What I want? I want
to go back to the Pangaea chaos-kingdom. I want to leave this place.
I want to see the princess. I want to see Master. Can you do these
things? Can you accomplish even one of them?” The youth stared at
Ning, madness apparent in his eyes. “Someone as weak as you
couldn’t possibly accomplish any of them. You can’t do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. He
didn’t even know where the Pangaea chaos-kingdom was. As for
letting the man leave? He didn’t have the ability to do so!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true that I
can’t do it,” Ning said. “However, I can make it so that your
life is a bit more comfortable. I can let things be more pleasant for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…comfortable…ahahahaha!
It’s over…over…all over. Master…Princess…I’ve waited
bitterly for three full chaos cycles…but this is the result? This
is my destiny? Ahahaha…” The insane youth couldn’t stop
laughing. “Master…Princess…Goodhill is on his way now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth in Ning’s
giant palm suddenly blew apart, his soul completely shattering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suicide?” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man had stewed here
for three full chaos cycles by himself. It would indeed be hard to
persuade such a person with just a few simple words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there,
staring at a large pile of items. These were the relics which the
young prisoner had left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope I can find
something that will tell me about the Pangaea chaos-kingdom,
something that can explain why the youth was so powerful.” Ning
carefully looked through the items. The first things he noticed were
those jade-green flying swords. He saw a total of 360 of them, each
of them emanating an invisible aura of sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Ning was
instantly stunned as he inspected them more carefully. “Top-grade
Pure Yang flying swords? All of them are top-grade…and there are
360 of them.” Ning knew very well that the youth had controlled
these 360 Pure Yang flying swords to form that jade-green sword-light
to fight earlier. “How could he, a Celestial Immortal, possibly be
able to simultaneously control so many top-grade Pure Yang swords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely hard
to control such powerful treasures. Even most True Immortals would be
unable to control so many top-grade Pure Yang swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And inside this…”
Ning instantly began to bind some of the storage treasures and
investigate their contents. He began to discover one item after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased ‘Goodhill’
could be considered a core member of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom.
Otherwise, as a Celestial Immortal, there was no way he would even be
qualified to be imprisoned here; he would’ve simply been executed,
rather than locked in here for countless years. Clearly, the King of
Pangaea had certain concerns of his own; most likely, he didn’t
want to so directly offend the school behind Goodhill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Goodhill
naturally had quite a few treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually has a
second set of 360…” Ning was shocked and delighted. Aside from
the first set of 360 jade-green Immortal swords, there was also a
second set of 360 fiery-red Immortal swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sets were of
top-grade Pure Yang swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two sets,
combined, were better than any of the Pure Yang treasure sets which
Daoist Threelives had left behind. But of course, they were still far
from being a match for the 3600 goldstar beads, which were supreme
Protocosmic spirit-treasures. Every single bead was more valuable
than a top-grade Pure Yang sword, and there were 3600 of them. That
set was something which Daoist Three Purities had acquired!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a Celestial
Immortal to have so many treasures…his wealth is far more
staggering than that of the vast majority of the True Immortals of
our Three Realms. Most likely, only supreme Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals like me or Patriarch Lu would be able to compare to him,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to
carefully inspect the other items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the treasures
being carried by the youth were Pure Yang treasures. All the items
were on the Pure Yang level. It was as though to this youth, Pure
Yang treasures were just common items. However, the strange thing
was, the youth didn’t have so much as a single Protocosmic
spirit-treasure on him. It must be understood that even people like
the Xia Emperor had multiple Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He destroyed all his
spirit-pills and Immortal herbs?” Ning looked at some shattered
bits and pieces of items, then shook his head. Before dying, the
youth had destroyed everything he could. However, he had been unable
to destroy the Pure Yang artifacts, and so Ning had acquired them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really didn’t
want to leave anything nice for me at all. Still, in the end these
Immortal swords became mine. Two sets of flying swords, 360 in each
set.” Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t know
was that one of the two sets was the set which Goodhill normally
used, while the other set was a backup set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the weapons,
the other treasures were quite ordinary. For example, the treasures
meant for fleeing were all merely at the Pure Yang level; they were
far from being a match for the likes of the Voidboat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After going through
Goodhill’s possessions, Ning was unable to find a single
cultivation technique or any records of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense.
Generally speaking, techniques are directly transmitted into the
mind. Secret manuals are rarely carried around.” Ning nodded. After
he had learned techniques from the Black-White College and the
Tristar Crescent Abode of Mount Innerheart, he had either put the
secret manuals back where they belonged or destroyed them. There was
no way he would just carry them around with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why it was
virtually impossible to acquire techniques like the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], the full [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], or
[Houyi’s Archery] through killing enemies. Ning, for example,
simply wouldn’t be carrying those techniques on him. He had
memorized them all within his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, right. All that
aside, Celestial Immortals and even Empyrean Gods probably have low
status within the Pangaea chaos-kingdom. There’s no way they would
be allowed to carry complete techniques around. And generally, when a
master teaches an art, various soul-oaths will be employed as well,”
Ning mused to himself. The more important a technique was, the more a
school would work to ensure it wouldn’t be leaked out. In fact,
even soulscouring usually wouldn’t be effective in acquiring a
complete technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, things might
be different for someone with high status.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“High status
individuals might have the ability to acquire some special
techniques, including ones that can be taught to those who are of a
different school,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
True Gods and Daofathers could choose to teach some techniques to
outsiders, if they so desired. In the Pangaea chaos-kingdom, the
Elder Gods and Daofathers could probably do the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, when I used
my heartforce to scan the region, I found an Elder God and a
Daofather.” Ning nodded slowly. “The Elder God should be more
powerful, and he looks like a wild dog. Perhaps it’ll be easier to
persuade him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning
desperately wanted to know why a Celestial Immortal could be so
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning left
Goodhill’s prison ‘cell’, he sat back into his Voidboat and fly
towards the Elder God that looked like a wild dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Pure Yang
treasures were now of limited benefit to Ning, and they were also
useless to Daofathers and True Gods. Daofathers and True Gods
generally used Protocosmic spirit-treasures or Chaos treasures!
Ning’s most powerful treasure set right now was the Stargold Beads
of the Heavens, but these two top-grade Pure Yang swords could be
used in setting up the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]. If he
gave it to his Primaltwin, his Primaltwin would also have a powerful
treasure to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat carefully
flew forward, avoiding the many ‘prison cells’ in the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine runes continued
to flow densely through the dark skies of the world. Their power and
aura made it so that Ning’s flying speed was much slower here than
it was in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for more
than three days, he finally arrived at the location where the wild
dog Elder God was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
stood outside the formation, but sent a strand of his divine power
inside of it in the form of a clone. The clone carried a wooden
platter with it, covered with two flagons of wine and fine
delicacies. A fragrance of saliva-inducing meat wafted out from the
plate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning’s
clone called out, carrying the platter forward into the formation
towards the direction of the wild dog Elder God.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 - Meeting The Elder God
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though they were
hundreds of kilometers apart, Ji Ning’s clone could still see the
distant form of the utterly emaciated wild dog lying on the ground.
He immediately grew even more courteous and respectful. His
heartforce had shown him how formidable this seemingly-unremarkable
wild dog was. It had been able to devour even the invisible, formless
power of heartforce; how could Ning possibly be a match for it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, this junior
is the newly-arrived Overseer. There’s something I would ask of
you, senior,” Ning’s clone said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sniff. Sniff. The wild
dog’s nostrils flared a few times, and then its eyes opened,
revealing a pair of ancient-looking dark-yellow pupils. It opened its
mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything within a
thousand kilometers began to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The platter which
Ning’s clone was holding actually flew into the air and towards
that mouth. The fine wine and delicacies on the platter flew with
especial speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
clone was completely unable to resist this power. “What a
formidable divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the wine and food
reached the wild dog’s mouth, they began to shrink in size, then
flew straight into it. Even Ning’s clone was about to be sucked in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior! Senior!”
Ning’s clone called out repeatedly, but the wild dog completely
ignored him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s clone could
sense that he was shrinking in size, while the wild dog before him
was growing larger and larger, seemingly as large as the heavens
themselves. It flew helplessly into the mouth of the wild dog, then
dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I
only sent a clone; all I lost was a bit of my divine power.” Ning
stood outside the formation, calling out, “Senior, there’s
something I need to ask of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the wild dog, a few
hundred kilometers away, just continued to lie there as though he was
asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And of course, if
there is anything you need, senior, I’ll do my best to satisfy
you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lucky kid, are you
able to release me? Let me out of here?” Finally, an ancient voice
rang out by Ning’s ears. The eyelids of the distant wild dog lifted
upwards as he glanced at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Ning
immediately asked, “Might I ask, what do I need to do to release
you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are two
methods,” the ancient voice said. “The first method is to have an
Elder God or an Ancestral Immortal with a talisman of command from
the King of Pangaea come here, then activate the talisman to unlock
the prison chains. At that point, you as the Overseer can bring me
out of this prisonworld, and I will regain my freedom. The second
method is to have a mighty individual who has reached the World-level
to forcibly shatter these shackles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World-class?” Ning
was stunned. “What’s the ‘World-level’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild dog glanced at
Ning, a hint of disappointment in its eyes. Still, it answered Ning’s
question. “They are the ones who have ascended beyond the Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals. You look as though you live in a
chaosworld. You should have heard rumors that your chaosworld was
originally formed from the primordial chaos by a mighty Fiendgod,
yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who are
capable of creating a chaosworld are at the World-level of power.
However, those Fiendgods who are born from the primordial chaos at
the World-level will all perish upon creating their chaosworld. They
were born for the sole purpose of establishing a world, and there is
no way for them to continue living afterwards. As for other Gods or
Immortals who manage to train to the World-level after countless
years and experiences, they are even more powerful than those
Fiendgods who were born at the World-level. Those individuals are
capable of destroying these shackles outright. In fact, given enough
time, they are even capable of destroying this entire prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pangu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level was
Pangu’s level! Mother Nuwa had reached Pangu’s level as well. No
wonder Mother Nuwa had been able to effortlessly dominate the Lord of
All Things as soon as she broke through to Pangu’s level! The Lord
of All Things had been powerful, and the Seamless Chaosworld had been
quite formidable, but Mother Nuwa had immediately slaughtered the
Lord of All Things, then frightened the Lord of the Demonheart into
merging himself into the Heavenly Daos. As for the Lord of All
Fiends, his escaping abilities were quite impressive; he had been
able to escape while bringing along many of the shattered remnants of
the Seamless Gate’s forces. They had hidden themselves in the
primordial chaos, not daring to return until Mother Nuwa left the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once anyone reached her
level, they would be able to effortlessly dominate all comers. The
difference in power was like the difference between Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So above the Elder
God and Ancestral Immortals are the World-class experts? Then what
level has the King of Pangaea reached?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s also a
World-class expert.” The wild dog looked towards Ning. “However,
he’s an extremely powerful World-class expert. The Pangaea
chaos-kingdom has a total of three World-class experts, which is why
it is so powerful. You must understand that it is very, very rare for
a chaosworld to give birth to even a single World-class expert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless
Chaosworld, for instance, hadn’t produced a single one. As for the
Pangu Chaosworld, only Mother Nuwa had reached that level.
Apparently, this was a level of tremendous power, even within the
endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master, your
elders…are any of the experts you know at the World-class?” The
wild dog looked at Ning. “They can be World Gods of the Fiendgod
path or Chaos Immortals of the Immortal cultivation path; so long as
they have reached the World-class, they can forcibly break apart
these shackles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know of one.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly?” The wild
dog’s eyes lit up with eagerness. Given his incredible level of
power, he was completely capable of telling if Ning was telling the
truth or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I haven’t
personally met this person yet.” Ning looked back at the wild dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that you
aren’t lying to me.” The wild dog’s attitude instantly became
noticeably better. Previously, he had been rather indifferent towards
Ning, because his experience was that it was incredibly rare for a
World-class expert to appear within the primordial chaos. However…now
that he knew that Ning’s side had a World-class expert behind it,
and given that he himself knew that Ning’s side wasn’t an
enemy…suddenly, he saw the light of hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Freedom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He desperately craved
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many prisoners
jailed here all craved their freedom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, tell me more
about these ‘World-class’ experts. My master has met that mighty
individual before, but I have not. I know nothing about them. Please
tell me a bit more, senior,” Ning said. And indeed, Subhuti had met
Nuwa before. Ning was telling the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master met this
person?” The wild dog’s attitude became even better. “Mm. The
paths of cultivation are divided into three. The first path is the
Fiendgod path. The primordial chaos will give birth to some living
creatures that will title themselves ‘Gods’, and they will
subconsciously choose to call their enemies ‘Fiends’. The
Fiendgod cultivation path is generally created by these Fiendgods who
were born from the primordial chaos, which is why it is named that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second path is
the Ki Refining path, which allows ordinary commoners born from the
mortal dust to constantly improve themselves and break through to
higher levels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, there is
the invisible, formless path of the heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three paths
are the three major paths of cultivation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendgod path
can be divided in the ‘mortal’, ‘Empyrean God’, ‘True God’,
‘Elder God’, and ‘World God’ levels. Supposedly, there are
even higher levels of power in the primordial chaos, as well as
figures who are even more powerful than the King of Pangaea. However,
in my sixteen chaos cycles of life, I’ve never encountered such a
powerful figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ki Refining path
can be divided into the ‘mortal’, ‘Celestial Immortal’, ‘True
Immortal’, ‘Ancestral Immortal’, and ‘Chaos Immortal’
levels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the path of
the heart…even I do not understand it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild dog continued,
“The core of any Ki Refiner lies in the Jindan golden pellet within
the body. This is their heart, which contains all of their ineffable
might. At the World-class, however, the cultivator shall completely
destroy the Jindan region, letting it return to the primordial chaos
it sprang from. When that happens, a chaosworld will emerge within
the Jindan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised. The
region within the Jindan was extremely vast; all of Ning’s magic
treasures were placed within it, as was his sea of Immortal energy.
To destroy it all and let it return to the primordial chaos, then
give birth to a chaosworld…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When that happens,
the Chaos Immortal shall have a chaosworld located inside his very
body. Naturally, his power will be utterly indomitable,” the wild
god said. “As for the ‘Daos’ which young fellows like you
inside the chaosworld train in, these ‘Daos’ are nothing more
than the rules by which the chaosworld operates. The ‘natural
energy of Heaven and Earth’ which you cultivate is the energy of
the chaosworld itself. All you are doing is temporarily borrowing it
for your own use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, to reach
the World-level, you’ll have to establish a chaosworld of your own,
inside your body. Although the chaosworld within your Jindan wouldn’t
be as vast as a real chaosworld in the outside world, you will be the
ruler and absolute master of it. Naturally, your power will become
enormous. It would be very easy for you to destroy an actual
chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Mother
Nuwa did indeed have the power to destroy the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because Immortal
cultivators at the World-level have established a world region of
primordial chaos within their Jindans, they are known as Chaos
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for Fiendgods,
their path involves continually increasing the power of their divine
bodies. With each improvement in their body, their power will
increase greatly. World Gods possess almost limitless power, and they
are capable of establishing chaosworlds of their own. Thus, they are
referred to as World Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two paths are
equal in power,” the wild dog said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Equal?” Ning was
suddenly startled. “Senior, are you saying that Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals should be equals? True Gods and True Immortals
should be equals? Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals are equals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. Although
these are two different paths of cultivation, the two paths are
indeed equal in power.” The wild dog nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. How
could the two paths be equal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods were clearly
comparable in power to Daofathers, while Empyrean Gods were on the
same level as True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ki Refining path
is a path that has been slowly developed and tested over countless
years, a path that allows ordinary mortals to cultivate and rise in
power. Thus, there are many different methods of Ki Refining.” The
wild dog stared at the distant Ning. “However, there are three
primary methods through which a person can overcome the Celestial
Tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal. These three different
methods will result in Jindans of different qualities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you…you’ve
trained in the worst method.” The wild dog shook his head. “Your
Jindan is incredibly puny. Even though you are now a ‘True
Immortal’, powerful Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals are
probably on par with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right, right!
Earlier, I fought against a Celestial Immortal in here. We were
indeed on par with each other,” Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild dog shook his
head. “The Ki Refining path you people train in is too weak. If
your world had a Chaos Immortal within it, things wouldn’t be this
bad. I believe the person on your side who broke through to the
World-level had to have made the breakthrough as a Fiendgod
cultivator. This person must be a World God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t deny it.
Nuwa had followed in Pangu’s path. She had indeed walked the
Fiendgod path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are three
different paths for Ki Refiners. Breaking through to become a
Celestial Immortal is the most important checkpoint in all of
cultivation. The Jindan formed during the breakthrough will determine
the power and potential the cultivator will have in the future,”
the wild dog said. “The weakest type of Jindan is formed when the
cultivator has to laboriously draw in the natural energy, condensing
it into a Jindan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A higher level
method is to rely on many precious treasures in forming the Jindan,
guiding the essence of those treasures to come together through your
own personal power. These Jindans are much more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The best method of
all is a method which imitates the birth of Fiendgods from the
primordial chaos. The bodies of those Fiendgods are formed from the
power of chaos itself. To create the most supreme of Celestial
Immortal Jindans, you have to use an entire vast world as your
furnace. This world needs to be extremely large, at least on par with
this prisonworld. What you need to do is to summon all the limitless
power of that vast world, then condense it into a Jindan. This is the
best-possible Jindan, and it will contain tremendous power of
incredible purity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the three
methods, the best method is to use the energy of an entire world in
order to cultivate the Jindan. The second method is to rely on
precious items to help you increase your power. The third method
primarily relies on you relying on your own power to draw more in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, there
are advantages and disadvantages to everything. The best method
requires you to use an entire vast world as your furnace, which is
only possible with the assistance of a Chaos Immortal. In addition,
when undergoing your tribulation, the power of the Celestial
Tribulation will be a bit more powerful than even an Empyrean
Tribulation.” The wild dog looked at Ning. “In the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, only a very small percentage of the core members are
capable of using the best method to produce a Jindan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you…it’s
too late. You are already a True Immortal. Your path is set. There’s
no way to change it.” The wild dog shook his head.
</P>

Chapter 30 - Upgrading The Jindan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My path is set?”
Ji Ning refused to accept this. He immediately asked, “I’m a True
Immortal right now! My Jindan is still fairly weak. Is there really
no way to upgrade it by even a single tier?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
cultivation techniques of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom, True Immortals
and True Gods should be on the same level of power! That meant he
would be equivalent to a Daofather in the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless. Your
Jindan is already formed. No matter how much you struggle, your path
is already set.” The wild dog’s dark-yellow eyes stared at Ning.
“You have the weakest type of Jindan possible. Even though you are
a True Immortal, some of the most powerful Celestial Immortals will
be stronger than you. Even if you become an Ancestral Immortal,
top-tier True Immortals will be comparable to you in strength. You
will always be a step behind them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth.
In the Three Realms, things were different. True Immortals were
comparable to Empyrean Gods, while Daofathers were comparable to True
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the heavens
always leave behind at least a sliver of a chance. There has to be
some way!” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, technically
there is,” the wild dog said. “However, the Jindan is formed
after the tribulation. To upgrade it later…this will be far, far
more difficult than even the Celestial Tribulation itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What method?” Ning
immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Special treasures
from the primordial chaos,” the wild dog said. “The primordial
chaos has given birth to many marvelous things. Certain treasures,
when mixed together, can allow the Jindan to be upgraded in quality.
However, very few know this method for upgrading the Jindan, and even
fewer are able to locate these incredibly rare chaos ingredients.
It’ll be almost impossible for you to upgrade your Jindan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…even if you do
manage to scrounge up the necessary chaos ingredients as well as the
upgrade method, you’ll at most be able to upgrade your Jindan to
the second tier. That’s the absolute limit,” the wild dog said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second tier?”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first tier is
the tier where True Immortals become equal to True Gods. The second
tier will only allow for True Immortals to be comparable to the
weakest of True Gods. As for the third tier, your tier…any True God
would completely massacre you,” the wild dog said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said delightedly,
“The second tier is perfectly fine.” To have a foundation
comparable to that of a weak True God was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfectly fine?
First of all, very few know the Jindan upgrade method. To acquire the
necessary chaos ingredients is even more difficult.” The wild dog
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, I wonder
if…?” Ning eagerly awaited the response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do indeed know a
method for upgrading the Jindan.” The wild dog shook his head.
“However…I couldn’t possibly teach it to you for no reason at
all. But of course, if you were able to bring that World-level expert
here, I would immediately teach you the Jindan upgrade method.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly said,
“Senior, the stronger I am, the higher my status will be. Only then
will I have a chance of meeting that individual.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve said
everything I need to say. Bring the World-level expert here. If that
person doesn’t come, then you can forget about bringing anyone
else, such as your Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. There’s no
point in them coming.” The wild dog closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior. Senior..!”
Ning repeatedly called out to the wild dog for a long period of time,
but the wild dog completely ignored him, acting as though he was
asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. The
wild dog wasn’t going to act without an incentive; as the saying
went, ‘you don’t release the hunting hawk until you’ve seen the
hare’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason this
ancient Elder God was even willing to tell Ning so much was because
of Mother Nuwa’s existence. The Elder God, however, wasn’t
willing to actually help out Ning at all, unless he was given an
incentive to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning’s
clone once more was carrying a wooden platter of food and wine, but
this time he was walking towards the filthy-looking old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning
understand that in the Pangaea chaos-kingdom, Daofathers and Elder
Gods were considered to be on the same level. This filthy-looking
elder was equal to the wild dog in power…and most importantly of
all, he walked the Ki Refiner path! Ning naturally felt tremendous
hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his
experiences in conversing with the Elder God, Ning was very careful
in his actions. The filthy-looking old man also wanted to leave this
place, and he was also capable of telling that Ning was not lying to
him. Thus, he told Ning many things. This old man also knew a method
for upgrading the Jindan, and he even had two of the chaos
ingredients needed to carry it out, although he didn’t have all of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…he wasn’t
willing to give Ning anything at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, would you
like for some fine wine or delicacies?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, do you need
any slaves or servants? Some people to accompany you, serve you, and
amuse you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that there
was no way to force it out of him, and so he tried a softer tactic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, stop wasting
your energy. I have an estate-treasure with me, and inside the estate
are a large number of servants and slaves. All sorts of wonderful
wine and food are inside the estate, just waiting for when I feel
hungry.” The filthy-looking old man gave Ning a glance. “I’m an
Ancestral Immortal. I’m capable of drawing on the power of
primordial chaos to replenish the energy of my treasures. Although
this prisonworld has set up a grand formation to harvest chaos
nectar, I’m still able to pull in enough energy to keep myself and
my estate-treasure in perfect shape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
The man was carrying servants and slaves with him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t bother with
any other tricks. None of them are able to beguile an Elder God or an
Ancestral Immortal. I’ll only be willing to help you once you bring
that World-level expert over and release me from my captivity,” the
filthy-looking old man said. And then, he shut his eyes as well,
paying no more attention to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really respond
to nothing whatsoever. He’s just like the wild dog. He won’t act
without an incentive.” Ning sat there on his Voidboat, grinding his
teeth in a very discontented fashion. “If I was able to meet with
Mother Nuwa, why would I be here? If Mother Nuwa was around, the
Seamless Gate wouldn’t dare to cause trouble. In fact, the Lord of
All Fiends and his Seamless Gate army wouldn’t even have dared to
return from the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This prisonworld had
imprisoned quite a few Daofathers and Elder Gods. All of them were
shockingly powerful, but none of them were able to do anything to
their shackles. Only if their power increased to Pangu’s level, the
World-level, would they be able to forcibly shatter them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
These experts at the Daofather or Elder God level all have some
degree of insight into the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos. All of
them are able to withdraw energy from the primordial chaos.” Ning
pondered on what to do. The Celestial Immortals present here all had
to rely on consuming spirit-pills to stay alive, but the Daofathers
did not; the filthy-looking old man, for example, was able to sustain
even his estate-treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, every
single Elder God and Ancestral Immortal was still at peak combat
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason the King
of Pangaea keeps Overseers in his prisonworlds is to keep a watch on
them. Once an Overseer sees that an Elder God or Ancestral Immortal
is breaking through to the World-level and shattering the manacles,
the Overseer is to immediately notify the King.” Ning understood
this. Not even the King of Pangaea was able to prevent these Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals from meditating on the Heavenly Dao of
Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Dao of
Primordial Chaos was everywhere, after all. But of course, becoming a
World-level expert was far too difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
those capable of succeeding would do so within a single chaos cycle.
Mother Nuwa, for example, had done so long ago. In truth, these Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals who had already been alive for multiple
chaos cycles had almost no chance of succeeding. However, they were
very long-lived and very powerful. Even if Ning asked his master
Subhuti to come here to help out, Subhuti would have no chance of
breaking the manacles…and if Subhuti attempted to kill these people
to steal their treasures, he might end up suffering a backlash from
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should take things
slow. If things look grim for us when the Endwar begins to approach,
I’ll tell Master and the others about this prisonworld.” Ning
wasn’t a completely selfless person; this prisonworld was
equivalent to an enormous treasury. It was up to him to figure out a
method to unlock it and access the treasures within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures and
techniques these Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals possessed were
all definitely extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for now Ning
had no ways to access any of them. Even if he summoned Subhuti,
Daoist Three Purities, Tathagata, Suiren, and the others to join
forces, they would still be taking on an enormous risk. Once these
ancient prisoners began to go berserk…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way for
Ning to assess exactly how powerful these prisoners. He was, however,
certain of one thing; the Pangaea chaos-kingdom was far more powerful
than the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode the Voidboat
at high speed for more than four hours before lowering it to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He slowly walked
forward across the desolate landscape. More than a thousand
kilometers from him was a woman, seated in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” The woman’s
eyelids twitched, then slowly opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…finally…a
living being approaches.” The woman’s eyes lit up. She was far
too lonely. It was hard for her to even stay alive here, much less
sustain an estate-treasure. Generally speaking, only the Daofather
and Elder God prisoners within this prisonworld were able to waste
energy on such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been a long
time since I’ve seen an Overseer.” The woman looked at the
distant Ning…but upon seeing him, her face instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A True Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s clearly a
True Immortal, but…such a weak True Immortal…? The Overseers of
Pangaea are all core members of the kingdom. Any True Immortal
Overseer should be a supreme, top-tier True Immortal.” Suddenly, a
thought entered the woman’s mind. She instantly felt completely
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
walked over, then said in a calm voice, “As you suspected, the
chaos-kingdom of Pangaea has been wiped out. You only have two paths
before you…to serve me, or to die.”
</P>

Chapter 31 - Soulscour
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated woman didn’t
panic at all. Instead, she began to laugh loudly as she rose to her
feet. As she did, her formerly-emaciated figure began to transform.
She became full-figured, and her skin became soft and tender. In the
time it took for her to rise to her feet, she transformed from a
starving beggar to a truly peerless beauty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lilisoft greets you,
True Immortal.” The woman smiled merrily. “It’s been a long
time since I’ve seen an outsider, and three chaos cycles since I’ve
seen an Overseer. I truly feel delighted by your appearance. Most
delightful of all is the news that Pangaea has actually been wiped
out. Wonderful…ahaha…wonderful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared at the
woman. She wasn’t going to panic at all?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might Lilisoft learn
your name or sobriquet, True Immortal?” The woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Ning
looked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” The
woman nodded slowly. “If you are able to release me, True Immortal,
I will submit to you. I’d even be willing to become your servant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m unable to
release you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman was slightly
startled, but she then nodded. “Right. It is too difficult to open
these shackles. Only a Chaos Immortal or a World God can open these
shackles without a talisman of command from the King of Pangaea.
However…True Immortal, I don’t wish to die. Thus, I’m willing
to submit to you. I would like to ask, however, that you not place a
soul-imprint upon my soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning actually chuckled.
“You agreed quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the
chaos-kingdom of Pangaea existed, the King of Pangaea wouldn’t kill
me, as he had to worry about other factions and factors. Now that it
is destroyed, however…in your eyes, True Immortal, all of us are
nothing more than alien prisoners. In a case like this, the only
outcomes are either death or servitude. I don’t want to die, so I
have to serve,” the woman said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was much like how
things were in the mortal world. Humans and monsters were born
enemies. Humans would kill wild beasts and cook them, while wild
beasts would attempt to eat humans when possible. Of course, powerful
Immortal cultivators and Diremonsters wouldn’t fight that much
against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the eyes of those of
the Three Realms, no mercy at all could be shown to any alien
Outsiders. If they released one, that person might return with other
alien Outsiders and wipe out the entire Three Realms! Thus, all of
them had to die…unless they could be forced to pledge fealty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The soul-imprint…?”
The woman looked at Ning. A soul imprint would have a slight impact
on her ability to comprehend the Dao, making it even harder for her
to progress on her Immortal path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for a soul-imprint.” Ning shook his head. “However…I am going
to use a soulscour technique on you. You are not to resist.” Since
there was nowhere for these people to go, there really was no need
for him to soul-imprint them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soulscour?” The
woman hesitated for a moment. This was equivalent to revealing
everything about herself to this man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are unwilling
to comply, then you are of no use to me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman gritted her
teeth. “Fine. Lilisoft will comply, True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the True
Immortal in front of her was of the weakest tier…if they ended up
actually fighting, even if the True Immortal was unable to kill her,
he would be able to force her to use up her Immortal energy. Once it
was all used up, she’d be finished. By contrast, the True Immortal
in front of her was the Overseer; his own energy would be constantly
replenished from the side world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt no pity at
all for these alien Outsiders from the primordial chaos. For the sake
of his own race…for the sake of his wife and daughter…Ning would
show them no mercy, no matter how many he had to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked into the
‘cell’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lilisoft shut her eyes.
She sighed to herself. “I used an innate beauty spell, but it had
no effect on him at all. Alas…” Just now, she had used up her
Immortal energy to restore her appearance, then cast an innate beauty
spell that enhanced her natural charm. This sort of natural, innate
charm and beauty was even more effective than ordinary, coarse
‘charm’ spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, Ning’s
heartforce was shockingly powerful, having reached the fourth level.
It wasn’t something which the beauty of a Celestial Immortal like
her could possibly shake. In truth…Ning hadn’t even noticed that
this woman had cast a spell; all he had felt was that this woman
truly was surpassingly beautiful. However, ever since he had sent his
wife, Yu Wei, into the Infinity Hells…to him, external beauty was
nothing more than rouge applied to a skeleton.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out,
placing his hand upon the top of Lilisoft’s head, immediately using
a soulscouring technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within her body was a
dazzling, enormous golden Jindan. Above the Jindan, there were images
of heaven, earth, mountains, rivers, and other things. The aura of
the Jindan was incredibly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First-tier Jindans
truly are formidable. She clearly is just a Celestial Immortal, but
her Jindan isn’t weaker than my True Immortal Jindan at all.”
Ning felt absolutely stunned as he sent his coresense into the
Jindan. However, he immediately cast that aside as he began his
soulscouring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her soul had merged
into her Jindan, becoming one with it. However, invisible strands of
soul energy began to infiltrate her Jindan like dots of starlight,
teasing their way into her soul. Fairy Lilisoft would’ve been able
to effortless fight back, as she was actually Ning’s equal in
power; there was no way for Ning to forcibly soulscour her. However,
Fairy Lilisoft had already given her. She suppressed her instinctive
desire to fight back, not daring to resist at all, allowing Ning to
investigate as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Ning began
to flip through a large amount of memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many things Fairy
Lilisoft had experienced after being born…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vastness and the
might of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was laid
bare before Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, these are the
cultivation techniques.” Ning finally located information regarding
Ki Refining techniques within Fairy Lilisoft’s memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These memories were
sealed like bubbles. Ning wanted to go inside them, but the surface
of these ‘bubbles’ was covered with many mysterious runes. No
matter what Ning tried, he was unable to look inside these memories.
All he was able to do was see a few odds bits and pieces from the
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In our Three Realms,
people usually swear oaths to the Dao of the Heavens or swear
Demonheart Oaths that they will not divulge or reveal the secrets
behind certain important techniques. Even if an enemy attempts to
soulscour them, the Dao of the Heavens will intervene to prevent it.
This technique the Pangaea chaos-kingdom uses, however, is even
tighter than that.” There was nothing Ning could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mysterious runes
covering these memories were incomparably marvelous and profound. No
Celestial Immortal could’ve possibly devised these runes; it had to
have been her seniors within her school who had created them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s only choice
was to give up and to continue viewing her other memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent a full twelve
hours doing so before he finally moved his hand away from Fairy
Lilisoft’s hair. She simply had far too many memories, and Ning had
wanted to get a detailed understanding of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom,
which was why he had spent such a long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how
things are.” A smile appeared on Ning’s face. “What an
unexpected surprise.” After fully reviewing Fairy Lilisoft’s
memories, he understood quite a bit about the Pangaea chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Lilisoft had a
very special status. Her grandfather…was the King of Pangaea! The
King of Pangaea had three sons, and Fairy Lilisoft’s father was the
second. When wandering the world, the second prince had ravished a
sacred maiden of a local school, then went on his merry way,
completely forgetting about her. Generally speaking, the more
powerful one was, the harder it would be for one to conceive. The
King of Pangaea, for example, had all three of his children prior to
reaching the World-level, and none after.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second prince had
never imagined that this casual rape of his would result in the birth
of a daughter. For a ‘sacred maiden’ to grow pregnant and give
birth…instantly, countless people cursed her as shameless, and her
life became very difficult. Fairy Lilisoft had grown up by her
mother’s side. She had watched as her mother was tormented, beaten,
and cursed at until her mother finally committed suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Fairy
Lilisoft to feel boundless hatred towards this father she had never
met.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some time after this,
the King of Pangaea had cast a spell that alerted him to the fact
that there was actually a member of his bloodline outside the palace.
He found this granddaughter of his, then brought her back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Lilisoft’s
status had instantly skyrocketed, and she was able to effortlessly
destroy the school that had become a nightmarish hell for her mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, she actually
felt even more hatred towards her father, the second prince. She had
lain in wait like a viper, waiting for her chance. Finally, her
chance came, and she sent the completely unprepared prince into the
‘Sea of Infinite Suffering’. Although the King of Pangaea quickly
arrived to rescue the second prince, he had still spent a full hour
inside the Sea of Infinite Suffering…and as a result, he had gone
insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The King of Pangaea had
been utterly enraged by this. There were very few members in the
imperial clan, however…and so instead of killing her, he had
imprisoned her within a prisonworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The King of Pangaea
truly is incredible. He was actually able to conquer a total of
twelve chaosworlds. In fact, he has actually killed at least three
World-level experts!” Ning was secretly amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a chaosworld was
born, it would slowly grow old with the passage of time, then perish.
After its destruction, however, a new Fiendgod would be born who
would establish a new chaosworld. Thus, the Pangaea chaos-kingdom had
actually been commanding a very large region for a very long period
of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to kill
someone at the level of Pangu and Mother Nuwa. The King of Pangaea is
both a Fiendgod and a Ki Refiner. He truly is incredible.” Ning
sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of power…the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom was far more powerful than the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I didn’t
expect that the [Five Treasures] sword-art is actually this
incredible.” Ning’s eyes lit up. “There definitely was no way
that Daofather Fuju came up with this sword-art. He must’ve found
it somewhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after searching
Fairy Lilisoft’s memories did Ning realize that only those who had
reached the World-level could create a technique that surpassed the
limits of the Heavenly Daos, with emphasis on the word ‘could’!
Not every Chaos Immortal or World God was capable of creating such a
technique. Not even Mother Nuwa had been able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom only had three techniques that surpassed the Heavenly
Daos in some way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangaea
chaos-kingdom had a total of three World-level experts, with the King
of Pangaea being the most powerful of them. The other two World-level
experts, however, hadn’t been able to create any techniques that
surpassed the Heavenly Daos. Two of the three had been created by the
King of Pangaea, with the third having come from a chaosworld which
they had conquered in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Techniques that
surpassed the Heavenly Daos…even Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
of the Pangaea chaos-kingdom had to render major merits to the
kingdom before they would be bestowed and taught one of the
techniques. Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods weren’t even
qualified to learn them at all. As for True Gods and True Immortals?
They had to have astonishing talent, have extremely high statuses,
and have rendered many contributions to the kingdom before they would
be taught one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who were taught
one of the three techniques would have to swear ‘life-oaths’ that
they would not teach it to any others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, the only one with the power to transmit these three
major techniques to others was the King of Pangaea himself. All the
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had sworn life-oaths upon
acquiring them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other
words…there’s no way I could possibly acquire any techniques that
surpass the Heavenly Daos in this prisonworld.” Ning felt truly
stunned. “Daofather Fuju of our Three Realms, however, actually
possessed such a technique…something which only a tremendously wise
person who was on Mother Nuwa’s level of power could devise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly thought
of the fact that before Daofather Fuju had died in the primordial
chaos, he had actually arranged for this legacy to be taught to
others. It was as though he had known that he would be in great
danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Fuju
must’ve acquired the [Five Treasures] sword-art from somewhere
else. However, he didn’t want to divulge the location, which is why
he claimed he created it,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>

Chapter 32 - Dominating True Gods And True Immortals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lilisoft stood there,
not daring to say a word. She knew that the ‘Overseer’ before her
was thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ji Ning looked
towards her. “Excellent. I know that you are running out of
spirit-pills. This bottle of spirit-pills should be enough for you to
stay alive for a period of time.” As he spoke, he produce a jade
bottle in his hand, filled with Pure Yang spirit-pills. These pills
instantly caused Lilisoft’s eyes to light up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, True
Immortal.” Lilisoft was extremely respectful. This was exactly what
she needed right now. In truth, Celestial Immortals used up very,
very little energy if they focused on staying alive and didn’t
fight against others. However…they simply couldn’t deal with the
obscene amount of time they had been imprisoned here. A chaos cycle
was an incredibly long period of time, and the total amount of
Immortal energy they used up each chaos cycle was quite shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
I would ask you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pray tell, True
Immortal.” Lilisoft was puzzled. The man knew all of her memories;
why did he need to ‘ask’ her anything?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust you can tell
that my Jindan is the weakest type of Jindan,” Ning said. “I’ve
heard that there are ways to use chaos ingredients and special
techniques to transform and upgrade the Jindan to the second tier.
This prisonworld currently holds many prisoners. What should I do in
order to acquire what I need from them and upgrade my Jindan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had seen
her memories, her thoughts and her ideas remained her own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
assistants, True Immortal?” Lilisoft looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m by myself,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…” Lilisoft pondered for a moment. “The weakest prisoners
here are Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals. The higher level
figures are True Gods and True Immortals, while the highest are Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals. The last two are able to draw upon the
energy of primordial chaos and are very powerful; I imagine, True
Immortal, that you won’t be a match for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the Empyrean
Gods and Celestial Immortals…they were fairly weak members of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom. No matter how ‘special’ they were, and
even if they do know of methods to upgrade the Jindan, they would’ve
been forced to swear life-oaths to never teach these methods to
others. In addition, it’s virtually impossible that they might have
valuable chaos ingredients on them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, only the True
Gods and True Immortals are left.” Lilisoft looked at Ning. “Only
from them might you find the materials that you need, Lord
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those True Gods and
True Immortals generally haven’t reached the level of being able to
draw upon the energy of primordial chaos, and so they are also forced
to rely on using spirit-pills to survive. It’s one thing to use
spirit-pills to preserve their lifeforce, but quite another to fight
in battle.” Lilisoft smiled merrily at Ning. “If you continuously
attack the True Gods and True Immortals, forcing them to use up their
divine power or Immortal energy…no matter how many spirit-pills
they have, they won’t be able to keep fighting for too long. In the
end, they’ll end up running out of energy and dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, you can
force them to submit to you! Alternately, you can kill them and take
their treasures for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures which
True Gods and True Immortals have are all far superior to the
treasures which Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals have.”
Lilisoft looked at Ning. “The prisonworld is a vast place, and
there are many True God and True Immortal prisoners here. Kill them
or force them into servitude. If you completely sweep through all of
them…I trust, Lord Darknorth, that you’ll be able to find what
you need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Lilisoft a
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a vicious mind she
had. She was merciless, even to members of her fellow race. Although
Ning had access to her memories, he truly hadn’t come up with an
idea like this before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, all you need
to do is stay outside the formation. You can attack them, but they
won’t be able to attack you.” Lilisoft smiled at Ning. “The
only outcome will be their defeat. Either they submit…or they
perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m far from being
a match for True Immortals and True Gods.” Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To kill a True God? Or
a True Immortal who was equivalent to a Three Realms Daofather?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the outside
world…Ning wouldn’t even dare imagine such a thing, given his
current level of power. But it would indeed be possible, here within
the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, all you need
is patience. Each of the True Gods and True Immortals will be
defeated by you, one by one. You’ll dominate them and sweep through
them, aside from any who might be able to draw upon the energy of
primordial chaos,” Lilisoft said. “Perhaps there are some with
that power in this prisonworld, but they are definitely in the
tiniest of minorities, less than one in a hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Very
good.” He then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to sweep
through the Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals, going through six
more of them. Two of them, upon learning that the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom had fallen, went berserk and tried to kill Ning.
However, Ning was protected by the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; he wasn’t
someone they could kill. Those two naturally ended up dying. As for
the other four, they were actually delighted by this news, and they
willingly allowed Ning to soulscour them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their choice, after
all, was to serve or to die. They knew what to choose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had scoured the
memories of a total of five Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals,
Lilisoft included. He instantly knew far more regarding the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I really do
have to turn towards those True Gods and True Immortals.” Ning sat
there within the Voidboat. “The idea which Celestial Immortal
Lilisoft came up with is the only possible solution.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods and True
Immortals were far more exalted figures than Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals. Just like in the Three Realms, the difference in
status was like the difference between Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Status…power…treasures…they
were on a completely different level. In fact, in the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, some powerful True Gods and True Immortals of certain
schools were permitted to transmit the Dao on their own accord, and
so they actually carried certain techniques with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Voidboat
flew into the air above a lake. The lake was dotted with tiny little
islands, one of which had a True Immortal prisoner on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Winterpeak was seated in the lotus position, completely absorbed in
his own thoughts. Suddenly, he sensed ripples from the outside world
and was startled into wakefulness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone’s coming?”
True Immortal Winterpeak opened his eyes. He instantly saw the
white-robed figure who was a few hundred kilometers away. He was
quite surprised. “A…True Immortal? With such a puny aura? This is
a True Immortal of the weakest variety possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the denizens of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom, True Immortals had a much higher status than
Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals, who were considered equal to
each other. Ning’s true body was both a Fiendgod and a Ki Refiner,
and Winterpeak could sense the Fiendgod aura emanating from Ning’s
body, but he paid much more attention to Ning’s Pure Yang aura.
Except…the Pure Yang aura around Ning was ridiculously weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the new
Overseer?” The look on True Immortal Winterpeak’s face suddenly
changed. “What happened to Pangaea? How could it have sent you
here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you have
guessed it already. The Pangaea chaos-kingdom is no more.” Ning
stood there in midair as he spoke. “This prisonworld has now fallen
into my hands. The previous Overseers probably wouldn’t have dared
to assault and kill the prisoners with no cause, but…I dare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Winterpeak scoffed. “You?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, he felt
quite arrogant. This sort of puny True Immortal was too weak;
Winterpeak would be able to effortlessly dominate him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you two
options.” Ning could sense the aura of danger emanating from the
man before him. The aura was so terrifying, it dwarfed even the
combined auras of the nearly three hundred Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals the Seamless Gate had sent to kill him. This True Immortal
of Pangaea definitely was on par with the True Gods and Daofathers of
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first choice is
to submit to me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second choice is
to resist me. I’ll continuously assault you from outside the
formation, while you will be unable to attack me at all. Your power
is incredible, and you are much more powerful than me…but when you
fight against me, you’ll use up your Immortal energy. Once it is
all used up, you’ll die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose,” Ning said
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Winterpeak’s eyes flashed with cold light. In the era of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom, this sort of puny True Immortal would be
terrified and quiver in his presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You overestimate
your abilities, you crawling insect,” True Immortal Winterpeak said
coldly. “None of the trillions of living creatures under my domain
would have dared to disobey my commands. An inferior True Immortal
like you who was born to a lowly caste…I can stand here and allow
you to attack me, and you still won’t be able to injure me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His pride and his
arrogance, as well as the status he had enjoyed for so long,
prevented him from lowering his head before such a weak True
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even though he had committed a major offense, the exalted King
of Pangaea had only elected to imprison him here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so? Then
permit a lowly, crawling insect such as myself to see your power.”
Ning waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a total of
729 Pure Yang flying swords appeared around him. 720 of them had come
from the slain Goodhill. All of them were imprinted with the runes of
the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]. With Ning’s fourth-stage
heartforce aiding his soul, he was able to activate and command all
729 flying swords at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s current soul
was capable of controlling even the perfect Heaven Punisher, to say
nothing of a few flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a jade sword
took form in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Greater Thousand
Swords Formation], level nine!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, so you have a
bit of ability.” True Immortal Winterpeak sat there in the lotus
position, a cold smile on his face. This crawling vermin…if it
wasn’t for this formation, Winterpeak would be able to easily
annihilate him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light
appeared in the skies as the jade sword stabbed straight towards True
Immortal Winterpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Winterpeak
just let out a cold snort. A streak of golden light shot out from his
eyes, and with a boom, the jade sword formed by Ning’s ninth-level
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was instantly blasted apart. It
was as though Ning’s sword-light was an egg smashing against a
rock. Naturally, it had been a completely one-sided ‘fight’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really does have
the power of a True God or Daofather of the Three Realms.” Ning
began to feel even more desire for the chance to upgrade his Jindan,
even if it was ‘only’ to the second tier. At least the difference
in power wouldn’t be this ridiculously huge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go, go!” Ning
formed one jade sword after another in front of him. The light of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] flashed repeatedly as the swords
chopped towards True Immortal Winterpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Winterpeak blocked three successive attacks. Finally, he began to
frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m using up my
energy too quickly. If this continues…” True Immortal Winterpeak
didn’t want to admit it, but the truth was that controlling magic
treasures to fight in this manner used up his energy far too quickly,
even though it was simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” A look of
anger and embarrassment appeared on his face as he let out this angry
roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a thirty
meter tall bowl-shaped treasure appeared. It covered the area where
True Immortal Winterpeak was located, protecting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Winterpeak,
cowering like a turtle in this fashion was a source of humiliation.
But by hiding under a magic treasure, he was able to use up much less
of his energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
flash of sword-light after another came chopping down upon the
bowl-shaped magic treasure, but they were unable to break through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
“The [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] uses up energy too
quickly. If I rely on just absorbing natural energy from the outside
world, it’ll take me forever to kill him. If I use spirit-pills to
replenish my energy…I’ll end up using too many pills. It seems I
have to come up with a low-energy tactic. Ah…right!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly was
struck by a thought. He was reminded of a treasure he had…the Eight
Fires Qiankun World! The Eight Fires Qiankun World held eight
different types of truefire within it, and their blazing power was
quite terrifying. All Ning had to do was use a bit of his own energy
to activate and maintain the Eight Fires Qiankun World. In addition,
his foe was trapped within a region of a thousand kilometers; he
wouldn’t be able to attack the Eight Fires Qiankun World at all.
His only option would be to sit there and be roasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was indeed a
perfect method. The burning power of the Eight Fires Qiankun World
wasn’t one whit weaker than Ning’s sword-chops with the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation], but it used up far less energy.

Chapter 33 - Roaming The Primordial Chaos
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” True Immortal
Winterpeak, hiding under the bowl-shaped treasure, discovered to his
astonishment that Ji Ning had halted his attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He stopped?” With
but a thought, Winterpeak dismissed his bowl-shaped treasure. The
mere act of keeping a treasure active required him to use up Immortal
energy. There were many prisoners here who wouldn’t even use their
energy on maintaining their clothes, causing them to corrode and
decay over the course of time. Although it was very hard for magic
treasures to be damaged, if enough chaos cycles passed, they would
still end up destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak raised his
head, staring at the white-robed youth in the skies. He smirked. “I
urge you to give up. A puny True Immortal like you must be forced to
consume an enormous amount of energy to release sword-light of such
power. Soon, your energy will be used up, and you’ll have to leave
the prisonworld to replenish it, which will take time. It will take a
very, very long amount of time for you to wipe out my energy using
such a method.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you afraid?”
Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak twitched.
“Hmph.” After a cold snort, he fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. He had no
way to replenish his Immortal energy, while the Overseer was able to
constantly regain it. With enough time, his Immortal energy would be
used up in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see just how
patient you are,” Winterpeak mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had placed the
Eight Fires Qiankun World within the Starseizing Manor. He had just
sent one of his clones to leave the stone stele and bring it back.
Because there was a bit of distance to travel, it took him a full day
of flying before he returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Winterpeak
frowned. He could see yet another white-robed figure flying towards
him from afar. “[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]?” He instantly was
able to guess at the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you really think
it’ll take me a lot of energy to attack you?” The white-robed
youth waved his hand, and a lotus of fire quickly soared into the
skies, moving to a location that was directly above Winterpeak. The
flaming lotus faced the ground and began to swivel. At the same time,
it quickly expanded to become a thousand kilometers in size as all
the petals of the lotus flower began to open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of eight lotus
petals completely unfurled, and streams of truefire began to surge
towards the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SHIT!”
Winterpeak’s face instantly changed, and the bowl-shaped magic
treasure once more appeared around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the sea of flames
surged towards him, every single inch of the bowl-shaped treasure was
bathed in fire. The ground around him was charred into ash.
Winterpeak just stood there in midair, protected by that giant bowl
as eight different types of truefire frantically assaulted him from
every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. This is much
easier.” Ning just stood there in midair, watching. The Eight Fires
Qiankun World created an independent world of its own, filling it
with flame to assault its foes. However, it wasn’t invincible; once
the enemy fled outside the world created by the treasure, the enemy
would no longer have to fear the assaults of those eight streams of
truefire. But alas, these prisoners were completely unable to leave
the region they were in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All they could do was
endure the eight punishing streams of truefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a treasure
that had been personally forged by Zhurong, Elder God of Fire. The
combined power of these eight types of truefire was truly
astonishing. However…since the treasure itself contained and
nourished these eight types of truefire, the only attack it really
had was truefire. All Ning had to do was to keep the treasure active,
then occasionally replenish a little bit of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit, shit, SHIT!”
Winterpeak was truly beginning to panic. “This blazing treasure
relies on internal flames to attack. It won’t use up much of his
energy; he can keep it active indefinitely. I, however, have to
continuously use my treasure to defend against it. If this
continues…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Where the hell
did he find a treasure like this?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak was both
furious and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Fires Qiankun
World held eight types of truefire in it. This treasure, by itself,
was worth more than a hundred top-grade Pure Yang treasures. Although
Ning had killed three Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods within
the prisonworld, he hadn’t acquired a treasure like this from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Starseizing
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A stone stele was
placed within a hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere. He glanced at the stone stele, then willed it to transform
into a streak of light that flew into Ning’s forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Ning
glanced sideways, then fifteen more figures appeared out of nowhere.
All of them had the auras of Celestial Immortals, and they all had
different appearances. These fifteen were fifteen of the eighteen
bodies Ning now had, transformed using the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When they are using
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] to disguise themselves, not even True
Gods or Daofathers will be able to see through them, unless those
Daofathers see them in person and use special ocular techniques to
test them. Not even the major powers who have the ability to view the
entire Three Realms and see into Protocosmic spirit-treasures like
the Starseizing Manor should be able to tell from far away that these
fifteen are all my clones,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very difficult
to infiltrate Protocosmic spirit-treasures and see inside of them.
The number of people in the Three Realms who could do such a thing
could be counted on two hands. After activating the Ninth Cycle of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and transforming…there was definitely
no way someone would be able to see through the technique when it was
used within the Starseizing Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only when no one
knows how many clones I have will the clones be safe and effective,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning emerged from the
Starseizing Manor, going back to his little thatched cottage. He
dispersed the minor clone he had left there, then raised his head and
looked towards the Five Treasured Peaks. “Ninefangs,” Ning sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a streak of
light shot towards him. The bald old man, Empyrean God Ninefangs,
immediately said respectfully, “Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Return to the
Starseizer world for now. There’s something I need to do,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged,”
Ninefangs said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning left by
himself aboard the Voidboat, departing from Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The infinite, vast Void
held many enormous stars within it. The most dazzling of all stars
were the Solar Star and the Lunar Star. In terms of size, even Nuwa’s
world or Suiren’s Kindlefire world were much smaller than the Solar
Star and the Lunar Star. The light that emanated from these two
supreme celestial bodies shone down upon the entire Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were stars that
were formed from the primordial chaos as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Pangu had
established Heaven and Earth, he had used up an enormous amount of
primordial chaos, so much so that a massive area around him became
empty and devoid of all matter. This was where the seemingly-infinite
Void came from. With all the primordial chaos sucked away, the stars
that had been hidden within them now emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A Voidboat was
travelling at high speed through the Void, passing through one star
after another. Soon, it reached the end of the Void. Although the
Void was often described as ‘infinite’, there was an end to
it…and at the end of the Void was the primordial chaos itself! The
Voidboat plunged into the primordial chaos, continuing to fly
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Within a
world of darkness. The Godking, seated upon his massive, levitating
throne, mused pensively to himself, “Why has Ji Ning entered the
primordial chaos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
yet to notice Ning’s abrupt departure from Sword Immortal world and
entry into the primordial chaos, but the Seamless Gate had. This was
because the Seamless Gate was worried that Ning was preparing to
ambush them once more, and so they had people watching him at all
times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s he doing in
the primordial chaos?” The Godking was puzzled. “Unfortunately,
there’s no way for us to investigate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking possessed
formidable divine abilities, and his invisible power could infiltrate
and investigate even the Void itself; there was nothing in the Void
that could block it, after all. But there was far too much energy and
matter in the primordial chaos; there was no way for him to scan it
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was vast and truly endless, filled with limitless amounts of gray fog
that contained marvelous types of energy and power. If one was able
to comprehend the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos, one would be able
to extract chaos energy from these chaos clouds. Ning, however,
clearly was not capable of this. He was unable to replenish his
energy from the primordial chaos, and so his only choice was to use
up his spirit-pills to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, this was
fine for a short journey into the primordial chaos. If he spent too
much time within it, the end result would be that his energy would be
depleted and he would die trapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many stars.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He often encountered
stars within the primordial chaos. The smallest were perhaps just a
million kilometers in size, while the largest were far larger than
even a major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these stars
were located within the primordial chaos, they were so close to the
Three Realms that the major powers of the Three Realms had already
thoroughly searched and investigated them, marking them out in maps.
Ning had acquired these maps from Mount Innerheart, and so he
travelled the quickest route possible past the various stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll choose this
star.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The star which the
Voidboat had reached was a star that was completely formed from
unyielding ice. In terms of size, it was probably comparable to the
Grand Xia. The entire star emanated an aura of absolute ice, and the
surface of the star was dotted with enormous crevices that looked
like gorges, as well as bulges that looked like mountain peaks. A
wild wind blew through this star, but there were no living creatures
on it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Fiendgods or
Immortals would be willing to live within such an icy, harsh
environment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed
it, and the stone stele instantly flew out from his forehead. As it
flew out, it flew straight towards the deep abyss located in front of
Ning. Soon, the gusts of wind blew it deep into the bottom of the
abyss. Ning used his coresense to watch as the stone stele landed at
the bottom. Very soon, a layer of icy frost appeared atop it, causing
it to completely freeze within the abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary people
wouldn’t be able to use coresense to locate it. Ning, however, was
the master of the stone stele; he was naturally able to sense it,
wherever it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no way for
anyone to locate the stone stele here,” Ning mused to himself. “Not
even major powers should be able to scan and locate it from far away
within the Void. Even if some of them are so incredibly powerful that
they can reach this place with coresense…the stone stele is an
incredibly mysterious object. Others have to see it with their actual
eyes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if a major power
knew that Ning had the stone stele and had hidden it within this
star, the major power would have to visually and physically search
through every single inch of the star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To search through every
inch of a star that was the size of the Grand Xia? Hah!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And of course, no one
even knew that Ning had placed the stone stele here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place shall be
my base for a last stand. If I end up being destroyed, at least the
two clones that I will keep within the stone stele will be able to
continue to cultivate, eventually restoring all the other clones as
well,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat then
continued its journey forward, going past several of the other stars
in the primordial chaos before Ning departed from it, returning to
the great Void. At his current level of power, he only dared to
voyage through the portions of primordial chaos that were very close
to the Three Realms and had already been fully investigated by
others. He didn’t dare to delve any deeper into the chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew that on
this voyage into the primordial chaos, Ning had hidden a stone stele
with two clones inside of a star. Those two clones would use the
Eight Fires Qiankun World and other Pure Yang treasures that could
unleash elemental attacks to assault the True Immortal and True God
prisoners inside the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to the
Void, then passed through it to enter the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing in midair,
Ning produced a talisman in his hand, filling it with his energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.”
Subhuti’s voice rang out in Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Your
disciple wishes to return to the Crescent world. In addition…there’s
something I need to speak to you regarding, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a whirlpool
appeared in the air next to Ning. Ning stepped into it, then began to
head towards the Crescent world.

Chapter 34 - A Surprise For Subhuti
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning passed through
the spatial vortex. A massive, levitating mountain suddenly appeared
before his eyes - Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning occasionally
exchanged a few words with familiar faces as he walked up Mount
Innerheart. Eventually, he reached Subhuti’s Daoist temple. The two
novices at the entrance, Clearwater and Whiteriver, didn’t move to
stop him. Clearly, they had already received instructions from the
Old Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the Daoist
monastery, then saw his master Subhuti seated in the lotus position
in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Subhuti looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ambushed the
Seamless Gate’s forces multiple times and killed more than ten
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals,” Ning said. “I wanted to force
the Seamless Gate to release my senior apprentice-sister, but they
still refuse to agree. What I didn’t expect…was that I gained a
surprising spoil of war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti chuckled. “And
why have you come in person to tell me, your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures of the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals weren’t that special. My greatest
spoils came from the death of a Celestial Immortal, ‘Youngflame
Freak’,” Ning said. “Amongst Youngflame Freak’s relics, I
found a unique item that contained seven great techniques. These
seven techniques are all unfathomably profound, and I had to struggle
quite hard in order to learn them. After I learned them, the unique
item actually shattered apart and dissolved into nothingness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had pondered for a
long time before deciding on explaining things thusly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could choose to keep
these seven techniques a secret from his master, but given that both
alliances were at war with each other, and that most of these
techniques were useless to him, it was better for him to report it to
his superiors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t afraid of
the Seamless Gate acting against him; rather, he was more afraid of
someone from his own alliance acting against him! For example, if a
major power who was on par with Subhuti suspected that Ning had
acquired formidable treasures from alien Outsiders, then killed Ning,
Subhuti might be enraged…but it would be too late for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Subhuti
smiled and nodded. “It may have been a legacy left behind by a
major power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was fairly common
for a legacy-teaching item to automatically shatter once the legacy
was taught. This was done to prevent the legacy leaking and becoming
too widespread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the seven
techniques your disciple has memorized.” Ning produced a bamboo
scroll. “Your disciple has already copied them down in their
entirety. Master, please take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti accepted the
scroll, then sent his coresense into it to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full hour passed.
Subhuti was completely occupied by his reading, while Ning simply
stood there to one side, waiting quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Finally,
Subhuti raised his head, a look of surprise and delight on his face.
“You’ve just done a great deed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a relaxed
feeling in his heart. It would be good if this could help his
alliance. His personal power was limited, and of the seven
techniques, the only ones that were of benefit to him were the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods] and [Armaments of Sin]. [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] could only be trained to the second level if one had some
extraordinarily precious ‘chaos nectar’. As for the other
techniques, for now it was difficult for him to advance in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These seven
techniques are definitely techniques left behind by alien Outsiders.”
Subhuti let out a shocked sigh. “I didn’t expect that this weak
little Celestial Immortal was actually holding techniques like this.
It seems that a slain alien Outsider must have left his relics and
treasures behind somewhere in the Three Realms, with Youngflame Freak
discovering them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know quite a few
alien Outsider techniques, but these seven techniques are definitely
top-tier ones. The [Jewel Talisman] is the most useful one of all!”
Subhuti’s face was covered with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have quite a few
alien Outsider techniques?” Ning looked at his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
Subhuti laughed. “We’ve killed quite a few alien Outsiders in the
years since the Primordial Era. Some were as powerful as Rahu, and
the Lord of All Things was particularly powerful. He had a mighty
army under his command, but we wiped them out. Naturally, we ended up
with the relics they left behind. The seven techniques you gained
must have similarly been left behind in the Three Realms by a slain
alien Outsider.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…while some
alien Outsider techniques are very useful, some are…” Subhuti
shook his head. “Some require treasures that exist in the worlds
where they were from, but don’t exist in the Three Realms at all;
those techniques are naturally useless. For example, the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods]; an enormous amount of treasures are needed to
train to the second level, some of which I’ve never even heard of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve previously
acquired two types of ‘clone body’ techniques from the alien
Outsiders. These two are the [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] and the
[Thousand Bodies Sutra]. The [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] technique is
very similar to this technique of yours, but it allows for the
creation of only twelve bodies, and it’s a bit easier to train as
well. There are a few experts amongst the major powers who train in
it. As for the [Thousand Bodies Sutra], it’s extremely formidable;
when mastered, one can use it to transform into a thousand clones,
each of which is as powerful as the original body. Once they merge
together, the true body’s power will explosively increase. But
alas, just gaining a basic level of skill in the [Thousand Bodies
Sutra] requires a treasure known as a ‘Worldheart’. Where are we
supposed to find treasures like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand Bodies
Sutra?” Ning was shocked. To be able to transform into a thousand
clones? That was too terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A ‘Worldhearts’
is created after countless years pass in a chaosworld and the
chaosworld begins to grow old. When the chaosworld dies, it’ll
transform into an extremely small gemstone which is the source of
energy for many new Fiendgods to eventually be born and establish a
new chaosworld. This gemstone is known as a ‘Worldheart’.”
Subhuti chuckled. “The [Thousand Bodies Sutra] requires a
Worldheart. We only have a single chaosworld, the ‘Three Realms’;
where are we supposed to find a Worldheart?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had searched the
memories of several Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods of the
Pangaea chaos-kigndom. He knew of Worldhearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Worldhearts were
treasures that were even more valuable and rare than chaos nectar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangaea
chaos-kingdom might have acquired some in the past, but without
question they were in the hands of the King of Pangaea or the other
two World-level experts. The Ancestral Immortals and Elder Gods could
forget about acquiring them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the seven
techniques you acquired, the [Jewel Talisman] is the most useful
technique of all. [Armaments of Sin] will also be of some use in an
era like ours; I trust that it will give birth to some new
Protocosmic spirit-treasures,” Subhuti said. “However…to rely
on slaughter alone to give birth to Chaos treasures is far too
difficult. I can’t even imagine how many people you would have to
kill to give birth to one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leaders of Buddhism
and Daoism, the Three Emperors, the Five Monarchs, Subhuti, and many
other mighty major powers had access to Chaos treasures. Thus, they
wouldn’t care too much about [Armaments of Sin].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, this
[Armaments of Sin] technique will be of use to you.” Subhuti
chuckled. “Still…the [Jewel Talisman] technique allows for the
creation of Dao-seals. Every single Dao-seal creation technique is
tightly guarded. You can create Dao-seals in advance, then use a
large number of them in battle to overwhelm and slay your foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally, that’s
only possible if we can find an expert in Dao-seals who can
understand the mysteries of this [Jewel Talisman]. In the Three
Realms, the most powerful expert in the art of formations and
talismans would be Human Emperor Fuxi,” Subhuti said with a smile.
“Even I feel delighted upon having reviewed the [Jewel Talisman],
and I’ll be able to produce some new Dao-seals. When Fuxi sees
it…he might be able to learn everything within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Jewel Talisman]
was simply unfathomably profound; when he read it, he felt like he
was reading gibberish. To Human Emperor Fuxi, however, this would
indeed be shockingly useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You said that
Youngflame Freak was in possession of that item; did he learn these
seven techniques?” Subhuti’s face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly
explained, “Master, I had to use all my power to learn these seven
techniques. Given that Youngflame Freak was a Celestial Immortal, I
expect that he was probably just barely able to learn the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods] and part of the [Nine Bug Solutions]. He wouldn’t
have the ability needed to learn the rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s what I
hoped to hear.” Subhuti chuckled. “The [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]
and [Nine Bug Solutions] aren’t that dangerous. In the past, when
there was peace between us and the Seamless Gate, many of us were
friends with each other. In fact, some of us became lifelong, bosom
friends, and we exchanged many techniques. They have many of ours and
we have many of theirs. They have the [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] and
the [Thousand Bodies Sutra] as well. As for the [Nine Bug
Solutions]…given that a very long period of time is needed to breed
these bugs, and that the process is a very expensive one, neither
side has the luxury of time and resources that would be needed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…just to
ensure that nothing unexpected happens, Youngflame Freak needs to be
gotten rid of,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had first bound
the treasures left behind by the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals,
then began to work on the many other relics he had acquired. Only at
the very end did he discover the stone stele hidden away amongst the
miscellaneous items. Binding so many treasures had taken him a full
day. If Youngflame Freak was going to reveal it to anyone, he
would’ve done so long ago, and so Ning hadn’t been in a rush to
kill his final few clones, pulling up grass by the roots.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak was
hoping to be lucky enough to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of those seven
techniques, I was only able to learn the first technique and part of
the second technique.” Youngflame Freak was sitting within a
palace, drinking wine. “I could tell, however, that these were all
inconceivably profound techniques. And the aura that stone stele
emanated…it was even more terrifyingly powerful than the Heavenly
Daos! If I was to report this loss to the Seamless Gate…in order to
ensure that none of the techniques are leaked, they’ll probably
kill me to silence me, once they acquire the technique from Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning will
probably hide those seven techniques for his own use. He won’t be
willing to tell others ab out them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It has to be
that way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak
himself had kept those seven techniques hidden without telling anyone
else at all. He believed that Ji Ning would do the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, he didn’t
even dare to make a report. If he gave such a powerful technique to
the Seamless Gate, he might be silenced and killed instead of
rewarded. Youngflame Freak knew exactly how the Seamless Gate
acted…they were absolutely savage and brutal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uhh…” Youngflame
Freak suddenly felt his head turn dizzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what’s going…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…might as well
die…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Freak’s
eyes turned dim…and then his soul dispersed and shattered. He
died…and the same happened to his other clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti closed his eyes
for a moment, then opened them. He looked at Ning. “The other two
bodies of Youngflame Freak have now died. All eighteen bodies have
perished now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Youngflame
Freak didn’t possess a treasure like the Voidboat; he didn’t dare
to journey out within the primordial chaos, and so he kept all his
clones within the Three Realms. Subhuti was thus able to effortlessly
kill him. Much like how Ning would be able to effortlessly hypnotize
weaker cultivators, Subhuti was able to effortlessly cause a
Celestial Immortal to commit suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, the Seamless
Gate would’ve deeply desired to cause Ning to commit suicide in
such a manner as well. However, Ning’s heartforce had reached the
fourth level, the same level as that of many Daofathers; there was no
way the Seamless Gate could force Ning to commit suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.
Accompany me on a visit to Human Emperor Fuxi,” Subhuti said with a
laugh. “When he sees this [Jewel Talisman], he’s going to be
delirious with joy. A top-tier seal-creation technique like this…this
is something he dreams of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A spatial
vortex appeared before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti took Ning by
the arm and led him straight into the spatial vortex.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 35 - Meeting Fuxi
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They emerged from the
spatial vortex. In front of them, as far as the eye could see, were
endless flows of primordial chaos. A short while ago, Ji Ning had
journeyed by himself into the primordial chaos, but of course he had
only toured the region that was very close to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi is currently
within the primordial chaos, working on various formations,”
Subhuti said. “Of the Three Emperors of Mankind, Shennong and Fuxi
spend most of their time in the primordial chaos, with Suiren usually
staying at the Kindlefire world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he led
Ning forward at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space and time
constantly shifted about them, causing them to move incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Due to
the speed at which they were moving, the flows of primordial chaos
around them became blurry and hard to see. However, Ning suddenly saw
an enormous blazing fire appear in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There we are.”
Subhuti’s voice rang out as their speed suddenly and dramatically
lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quickly led by
his master towards those towering flames. The flames roared and
hissed in a veritable sea of conflagration. It was hard to see where
the sea of flames ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Water?” Ning
suddenly discovered to his astonishment that there seemed to be dark,
barely-visible waves that were rippling above the sea of flames. Only
when he stared at them carefully did he recognize them for what they
were…countless waves of black water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below was an endless
sea of flames, while above were endless waves of black water. The two
seemed to be part of a whole, and the space between the flames and
the waves seemed to be continuously destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi,” Subhuti
called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a corridor
appeared within the sea of flames in front of them. The flames on
each side of the corridor couldn’t enter it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
inside,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed behind
Subhuti, the two of them flying inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this a formation
which the Human Emperor set up?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
“These flames…I can’t even tell what type of flames they are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most famous flames
in the Three Realms were the nine types of truefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the ‘Eternal
Kindlefire’ which Human Emperor Suiren developed,” Subhuti said.
“These flames surpass the nine types of truefire in power. As for
the waves of water above them, they were formed by extracting the
essence of Arcane Moonwater from the Lunar Star. The Kindlefire was
established with the help of Suiren, which is why the flames are so
numerous. The essence of the Lunar Star, however, has to be extracted
by Fuxi himself, which is why there is a bit less of the water. This
is a formation that Fuxi has been working on for some time, and it
isn’t perfected yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
Eternal Kindlefire? Arcane Lunar Water?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most weaker
cultivators, including Ning himself, had no idea that there were any
flames more powerful than the nine types of truefire. Ning himself
only found out now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solar Truefire was
commonly seen on the surface of the Solar Star; there was an enormous
amount of it there. However, Golden Solarfire came from the very core
of the Solar Star, and its power was far greater than that of Solar
Truefire. Golden Solarfire…even True Gods and Daofathers had to be
careful around it. If they weren’t carefully, they’d be burnt to
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden Solarfire came
from nature itself. However, the Zhurong Godfire which Elder God of
Fire Zhurong created was also a type of fire that surpassed the nine
mighty types of truefire. Alas…Elder God Zhurong himself had
perished long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Human Emperor Suiren
had developed the Eternal Kindlefire, which was another type of fire
that surpassed the nine types of truefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms also
had nine types of truewater. Above them in power were two types of
water; Arcane Moonwater from the Lunar Star, and the Gonggong
Godwater from Elder God of Water Gonggong. Alas, Elder God Gonggong
had also died long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten exalted Elder
Gods had fought amongst themselves during the Primordial Era, and
several of them had died in their struggles for supremacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Pangu wasn’t
really an ‘Elder God’, he was a World God. However, back then the
various Fiendgods didn’t know what ‘World Gods’ even were.
Because Pangu was simply far too overwhelmingly powerful, the ten
Elder Gods considered Pangu to be in a class of his own, the ‘Pangu
level’, a level which surpassed all Immortals, Buddhas, Fiends, and
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pangu established
Heaven and Earth, then died from his labors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa entered the
primordial chaos, never to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Fuxi had been
reborn as a human, becoming Human Emperor Fuxi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple Elder Gods had
died during the struggles for supremacy of the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war against the
Seamless Chaosworld and the Lord of All Things that destroyed the
Primordial Era had resulted in the deaths of even more Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the likes of
Human Emperor Fuxi were now forced to laboriously extract Arcane
Moonwater from the Lunar Star. Fortunately, Fuxi was a master of the
Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang, which was why he was able to draw upon
the supremely Yin-aligned Arcane Moonwater. However, clearly his
skill in controlling water was not a match for Suiren’s skill in
controlling fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi has focused his
efforts on the art of formations. If he was to focus his efforts on
water…given his power and his insights into the Heavenly Daos of
Yin and Yang, he probably would’ve long ago been able to develop a
form of arcane water that surpassed the nine types of truewater,”
Subhuti said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In his past life, he
was an Elder God that was a master of the Heavenly Dao of
Destruction. In this life, he is a Human Emperor, but he has decided
to focus on formations.” Ning felt extremely curious regarding
Fuxi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was someone who
stood at the very peak of the Three Realms, in both this life and the
previous one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they passed
through the flame corridor, they saw an island that was a few hundred
meters long hover there in the midst of the primordial chaos. Atop
the island was a tall, muscular man dressed in Daoist robes who was
seated in the lotus position. His robes were covered with many Taiji
diagrams, Eight Trigrams diagrams, stellar diagrams, and other types
of formation-diagrams. The area surrounding him was filled with
countless swirling runes. Fuxi was staring at the countless runes,
occasionally changing them and occasionally moving them around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. Wait a bit,” Subhuti instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the time needed
to boil a kettle of tea, the distant Fuxi finally came to a halt,
allowing all the runes around him to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smiling, Fuxi looked
towards Subhuti and Ning. “Subhuti, why have you brought your
treasured disciple here? Come, sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waved his hand,
producing a pair of prayer mats in front of him. In front of each
prayer mat was a table covered with wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti led Ning
forward. The two seated themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally, I come
bearing good news.” Subhuti handed the scroll Ning had given him to
Fuxi. “Take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Fuxi accepted
the scroll, then immediately sent his coresense into it to examine
it. Upon doing so, he instantly became completely transfixed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient,” Subhuti said to Ning. “This is just how Fuxi is.
Let’s just wait here for now. Come, taste the wine. This is wine
which Fuxi personally created using his insights into the art of
formations. There’s no other place with wine like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lifted up his
winecup, taking a sip. Instantly, an incredibly comfortable feeling
spread throughout his body. Even his soul felt more relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is fine
wine.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one else can make
it,” Subhuti agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two, master and
disciple, began to chat and drink the wine. The tables were covered
with what appeared to be small flagons of wine, but in truth every
single flagon contained an enormous lake of Immortal wine within it.
The two drank to their hearts content for more than a full day before
Human Emperor Fuxi finally withdrew his coresense from the bamboo
scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Good. Good!”
Fuxi was so excited, he said the word ‘good’ three times in a
row.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Subhuti looked at him. “The [Jewel Talisman] is nice, eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao-seals
recorded within the [Jewel Talisman] are all incredibly marvelous. I
had to spend six hours to completely comprehend all of them. Once I
acquire all the necessary materials, I’ll be able to construct
quite a few powerful Dao-seals.” Fuxi chuckled, “Thanks to these
Dao-seals, our Nuwa Alliance will have an extra tool to rely on.
Although the benefits will be minor…when many minor effects are
added together, they’ll be able to influence the overall course of
events.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the words
‘benefits will be minor’, Ning instantly understood that the Nuwa
Alliance had an extremely deep foundation, many of which he had no
idea about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
formidable abilities, but the Nuwa Alliance did as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At this point in
time, there are very few things that can increase the power of our
Nuwa Alliance as a whole. This [Jewel Talisman], however, is one of
them.” Fuxi shook his head and sighed. “However, as far as I’m
concerned, the most beneficial technique of the seven was the
[Qiankun Reversing Gestalt-Formation]. The reason I spent so much
time just now was primarily because of that formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? The [Qiankun
Reversing Gestalt-Formation]? It helped you significantly?” Subhuti
was puzzled. “This formation requires eighteen individuals to set
up, and it also requires them to be of completely one mind. How could
it have been of assistance to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, this is where
you are wrong.” Fuxi shook his head. “Although this is an
excellent formation, the formation that I’m developing is even more
astonishingly powerful. I naturally won’t turn towards setting up
the [Qiankun Reversing Gestalt-Formation]. However…the mysteries
and secrets this formation contains are completely different from
those used to set up formations in the Three Realms. In addition, it
is especially powerful in the ‘Qiankun Reversal’ aspect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi sighed. “All
these years, I’ve been slowly working on my Waterflame Apocalypse
Formation and coming up with ideas on how to better combine these two
types of supreme fire and water. The ‘Qiankun Reversal’ in the
gestalt-formation gave me many new ideas. Although the [Qiankun
Reversing Gestalt-Formation] isn’t that powerful, the person who
developed it is most likely much more powerful than even myself in
the Dao of Formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At Fuxi’s level, when
he looked at a formation, Fuxi looked at how the formation was
constructed. He was able to completely ‘disassemble’ it into its
component parts. Clearly, Fuxi had gained what he had needed from
this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And it was true; this
[Qiankun Reversing Gestalt-Formation] had indeed been created by a
major power within the primordial chaos, expressly for those who
trained in the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]. However…when Fuxi said
that this person was superior to him in the Dao of Formations, Fuxi
had been wrong. The major power that had created this formation had
lived in a completely different environment, which was why there were
naturally many differences in the mysteries this formation contained.
This was the reason why Fuxi had gained so many new ideas upon seeing
this formation. In terms of actual insight into the Dao of
Formations, however, the creator of the [Qiankun Reversing
Gestalt-Formation] was just barely on par with Fuxi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it help you
perfect the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation?” Subhuti was surprised
and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal Kindlefire,
Arcane Moonwater; either of the two were tremendously powerful on
their own. But if Fuxi was to successfully and perfectly combine the
two of them…the results would be utterly astonishing. It would be
extremely useful during the final Endwar, and it would give them
better chances of winning it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was indeed of
use.” Fuxi nodded. “However, I’m still far, far away from being
able to completely perfect this technique. I still need to spend some
more time analyzing this gestalt-formation in detail. Mm. These seven
techniques…all of them are excellent. They clearly do not belong to
the Three Realms; they should have come from alien Outsiders. Since
you brought your disciple over…was it Ji Ning who discovered these
seven techniques?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Subhuti
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi looked towards
Ning, then sighed in a gratified manner. “All people are selfish.
Petty selfishness is focused on the self; nobler selfishness is
focused on one’s family, one’s clan, one’s nation, one’s
race, and even one’s entire world. You are merely an Empyrean God
and a True Immortal. For you to be willing to hand over these seven
precious techniques…this really is quite rare and admirable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt ashamed upon
hearing this. He had indeed given the seven techniques to his master
for the sake of the Nuwa Alliance, but he had kept the stone stele
for himself. He had hidden it away without telling anyone, partially
because he was worried about the Seamless Gate’s formidable
intelligence mechanisms, but also because he wanted to keep something
in reserve for himself. It was very possible that he might die as a
result of this storm that was sweeping the Three Realms. He wasn’t
afraid of dying, but if he died, who would protect his daughter?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the seven
techniques you provided, the [Jewel Talisman] will be of benefit to
the entire Nuwa Alliance, while the [Qiankun Reversing
Gestalt-Formation] is of considerable benefit to me. Mm…I can’t
just take these things from you without giving anything back,” Fuxi
said.

Chapter 36 - Skyrocketing Cultivation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi pondered for a
moment, then said, “Ji Ning, how much of the perfect Heaven
Punisher’s power can you control?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can already
control all of it,” Ji Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi revealed a small
smile. “This type of grand formation that involves commanding
countless Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals is extremely taxing
on both heartforce and Immortal energy, and it also requires a
powerful soul heartforce technique. Of all the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals of the Three Realms, you are the one who is best-suited to
commanding these formations. Prior to this, there was no one as
skilled as you in this regard, which is why the likes of the perfect
Heaven Punisher Formation were viewed as the apex.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. There were
several formations comparable to the Heaven Punisher Formation, and
his own master Subhuti had access to some of them. Since their power
was on par with that of the Heaven Punisher Formation, Ning hadn’t
asked for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fourth level
heartforce, and a soul heartforce technique…yes, you really are a
perfect fit for these formations.” Fuxi chuckled. “Give me a bit
of time, I’ll gift you with a formation that will allow you to
control even more Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals. Naturally,
the maximum power of the formation will greatly increase as well!
However, controlling it will also be considerably more difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Human
Emperor.” Ning was overjoyed. In truth, he wasn’t interested in
any treasures the Human Emperor could give him, because Ning already
had access to Protocosmic spirit-treasures. In addition, two of
Ning’s clones were within the prisonworld and were assaulting the
various True Gods and True Immortals; he would definitely have plenty
of powerful treasures in the future! A Chaos treasure would be
excellent, but what were the chances that Fuxi would give him one?
Many major powers didn’t even have access to such treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A formation that was
more powerful than the Heaven Punisher Formation was something which
Ning was in desperate need of. This was because Ning’s most
powerful battle-mode was the Heaven Punisher mode. However, he had
already completely utilized all the power available to the perfect
Heaven Punisher; there was no way to increase his level of power at
all. But alas, there were no superior formations of this type in all
the Three Realms, and there were very few individuals who were
capable of creating one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi, however, was
definitely the most powerful expert in the Three Realms in the Dao of
Formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This won’t be too
difficult for me. All I have to do is spend a bit of effort on it
when I’m not working on the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation. I
imagine I should be able to complete it within ten years,” Fuxi
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.” The
nearby Subhuti looked towards Ning. “You can count on one hand the
number of times Fuxi has custom-designed a formation for someone.
This is incredibly rare. Fuxi, Ning and I won’t disturb you any
further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Fuxi
smiled and nodded. “I’ll have to trouble you to leave my
formation first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A corridor appeared in
the endless sea of flames in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti immediately led
Ning out through the corridor. Within this Waterflame Apocalypse
Formation, not even Subhuti was able to engage in teleportation. He
had to first leave the formation area, then teleport. This was a
formation that Fuxi had spent countless eons perfecting; its power
was truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They returned to Mount
Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning said
respectfully, “I wonder if I can teach this [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] technique to Uncle White and the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti said, “This
is a technique that you acquired; by all rights, I shouldn’t stop
you from teaching it to others. However, it’s best if you do not.
Your spirit-beasts are all too weak, after all. It’s impossible for
the Seamless Gate to stealthily steal this technique from your mind,
but your spirit-beasts haven’t even undergone the Celestial
Tribulation. That ‘Godking’ would probably be able to steal away
those techniques from them in their dreams.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this? If
you want to teach them something, teach them the [Twelve Heavens
Fiendgod] technique. There are others in the Three Realms who have
mastered it and are able to transform into twelve bodies that each
have the power of the original.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said. “I’ll go pay them a visit, then I’ll leave the Crescent
world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Subhuti
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, Ning carefully
read through the entire [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] technique. This
technique was very similar to the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]; both
were divided into three levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level allowed
the true body to divide into twelve clones, with each clone being
much weaker in power than the original. This state was actually not a
very good one; the only benefit was that it allowed the user to have
a much better chance at staying alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level
allowed for all twelve bodies to rise in power, returning to the
level which the original body had been at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third level allowed
for all twelve bodies to merge back together into a single true body
once more, with the true body instantly and explosively increasing in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was almost
identical to the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] formation. However, it
was noticeably easier to train in, and it required less materials. In
fact, all of the ingredients needed to train to the second level
could be located within the Three Realms! But of course, all of those
ingredients were still quite rare and expensive. In addition, the
more powerful one was, the more of the ingredients would be needed,
as the cost of training would increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After soulscouring the
prisoners of the prisonworld, Ning had learned quite a bit. Fairy
Lilisoft, for example, had been the King of Pangaea’s daughter. The
other Empyrean God and Celestial Immortal prisoners were similarly
extraordinary figures who also knew many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning had
learned from them that to train to the second level of the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods], a Celestial Immortal of the first tier would
generally need a full bottle of chaos nectar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had roughly used
up a full bottle as well, but a little was left over. This was
because Ning was the lowest-tier True Immortal. In terms of the
quality of his Immortal energy, he was merely on par with the
highest-tier Celestial Immortals. But in terms of how much energy he
had, he actually had much less. This was because first-tier Celestial
Immortals formed their Jindans through absorbing the energy of an
entire vast world. Their Jindan regions were quite shocking, and the
amount of Immortal energy they contained was huge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First-tier True
Immortals would generally need a hundred bottles of chaos nectar to
succeed! In every aspect, be it the Jindan or the soul, first-tier
True Immortals were far more powerful than first-tier Celestial
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First-tier True
Immortals…their coresense was enough to cover an entire chaosworld!
In the Three Realms, only True Gods and Daofathers had this sort of
power. One could judge the power of one’s soul from the strength of
one’s coresense. To split such a powerful soul into eighteen parts,
then have all of them return to the power level of the original
soul…the amount of chaos nectar that would be consumed was
enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a first-tier
Ancestral Immortal was to train in the technique, the price would
increase a hundredfold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the greater the price one would have to pay to acquire eighteen
clones of tremendous power. Thus, even the King of Pangaea had only
been able to train to the second stage as a True Immortal. After
becoming an Ancestral Immortal, he had wandered through the
primordial chaos and experienced many hardships before being lucky
enough to acquire the resources to master the third stage of the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]. His power level had instantly exploded,
making him an absolute hegemon amongst Ancestral Immortals. After he
broke through to the World-level, he was thus able to build up an
extremely powerful nation and slay other World-level experts, with
two such experts electing to follow him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the entire Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, only the King of Pangaea had fully mastered this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet little
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ning was
seated within a winehouse, staring far away while holding a winecup
in his hands. He watched as a woman was leading a girl forward
through the distant streets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman was Autumn
Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The girl was
Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother. Uncle White.” Ning looked towards Mu Northson
and Uncle White. “Wait here for now. I’m going to make a short
trip, but I’ll be back soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, senior
apprentice-brother. Go ahead. We’ll keep an eye on things here,”
Northson said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, son,”
Uncle White said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had spent the past
period of time wandering the Crescent world alongside the childlike
Brightmoon. Everyone had been quite relaxed, and this caused both
Northson and Uncle White to both become more amiable and gentler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
nodded, then disappeared without a trace. Although some people in the
winehouse were watching, none of them thought that anything was
amiss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the little
city, there was a seemingly ordinary-looking Immortal estate. This
was a Pure Yang treasure which Ning’s Primaltwin was controlling,
their temporary home. Because he wanted to give his daughter
Brightmoon a good upbringing, he naturally couldn’t just let her
wander about the Crescent world willy-nilly. She had to have a
permanent place to call home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
flew into the Immortal estate. A white-robed Ning was already inside,
having come here to deliver a bottle of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just half a day later,
within a private room inside the Immortal estate. Eighteen
black-robed Ji Nings were seated in the lotus position. All of their
auras were completely suppressed, and they seemed to be ordinary
mortals. All of them opened their eyes, smiling at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second level is
complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After handing them the
copy of the [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] technique, Ning’s true body
had immediately left. The Primaltwin had used up a bottle of chaos
nectar to master the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] technique. However,
all eighteen clones had completely suppressed their auras. When Ning
had broken through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal, none of the
other major powers of the Three Realms had been able to find out,
because of this aura-suppressing technique which Patriarch Subhuti
had taught him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to keep
his aura suppressed. So long as Ning didn’t voluntarily activate
these eighteen clones, no one would be able to find out how powerful
Ning’s eighteen Primaltwin clones were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
The Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the arrangements
have been made.” Ning stood there in front of his thatched cottage,
staring at the distant, towering Five Treasured Peaks. The five peaks
continuated to emanate that shocking, breathtaking aura of majesty.
“The stone stele has already been hidden away. I now have a better
chance of surviving this great storm. My Primaltwin has now
successfully manifested eighteen clones as well. Only…I only have
slightly more than sixteen bottles of chaos nectar left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning flew
towards the second mountain of the Five Treasured Peaks, beginning to
read the second chapter of the [Five Treasures] sword-art and
meditate on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Starseizing
Manor. Those fifteen clones of his true body were all seated in the
lotus position, completely focused on meditating on the [Five
Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the stone stele.
The two clones of his true body were using some of their energy to
maintain the Eight Fires Qiankun World, but they didn’t have to
spend much attention on it, and so they were also meditating on the
[Five Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Crescent
world. Seventeen clones of his Primaltwin were all meditating on the
[Five Treasures] sword-art, with the final clone spending all of its
time and energy on taking care of Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be said that
right now, thirty-five Ji Nings spread across his ‘true bodies’
and ‘Primaltwins’ were simultaneously meditating on the [Five
Treasures] sword-art. Or, to put it another way…compared to before
Ning had started to train in the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], Ning’s
training speed was now thirty-five times faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-art is
incomparably arcane and unfathomable…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-five clones
all shared the same mind and memories. When one gained an insight,
all of them gained the insight, and so a nonstop flow of insights was
entering his mind.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_37___Roaming_The_Three_R"></A>
Chapter 37 - Roaming The Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, more than half a year had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to a towering,
cloud-piercing mountain peaks. Ji Ning stood atop a cloud, staring
upwards towards the sword-art left behind on the mountain wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Five Treasures]
sword-art truly is a sword-art that has surpassed the limits of the
Heavenly Daos. I’m just a tiny bit away, but…I’m unable to
completely master the second chapter.” Ning frowned. During this
past half year, he had almost completely mastered the entire second
chapter at one go, but the final bottleneck had stymied him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bottlenecks were
terrifying things for cultivators to face. There were many who would
be stuck at a bottleneck for countless years without being able to
advance! Time alone wouldn’t necessarily suffice for a cultivator
to break through a bottleneck; if one could constantly improve, then
logically speaking all Celestial Immortals should eventually become
True Immortals. Clearly, however, this wasn’t the case. The reason
why Ning had been able to break through the final bottleneck and
master the complete Dao of the Sword was because he had battled in
the Nihilum Zone for eighteen years, and had mastered first level
swordforce. This was why things proceeded so smoothly for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next
breakthrough won’t be so easy. What should I do?” Ning frowned.
At this point, not even his many clones could help him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Standing here like
an idiot won’t be of any use. Breakthroughs require luck and
destiny.” Ning immediately sent a mental message. “Ninefangs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! A streak of
light flew over, landing atop the cloud. It was the bald old man,
Ninefangs. Empyrean God Ninefangs immediately said respectfully,
“Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to travel
through the Three Realms,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Travel through the
Three Realms?” Ninefangs was startled. He gave Ning a close look.
He had thought that Ning wanted to once more ambush the Seamless
Gate…but now, it seemed, that wasn’t the case.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
immediately led Ninefangs away from Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast world of
darkness. The Godking, seated upon his great, levitating throne,
immediately received word of Ning’s departure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has left
Sword Immortal world.” The Godking immediately released his
powerful coresense to investigate Ning’s whereabouts. “He’s
already gone to…Tigerfang major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having suffered
such severe losses last time, the Seamless Gate would naturally be
prepared for a reoccurrence. They wouldn’t succumb to the same
trick twice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Tigerfang world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wooden ship was
drifting through a wide river. Atop the wooden ship was a white-robed
youth who was drinking wine by himself. Next to him stood an old,
respectful, bald-headed servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Tigerfang world
belongs to the mighty Immortal Tigerfang. He rose to sudden
prominence during the Primordial Era, and even took part in the war
that ended that era. However, he likes to travel alone and does as he
pleases, and so he dislikes taking apprentices. There are still two
Empyrean Gods who are willing to follow him, and he is quite a
powerful figure of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor had
relied on his experts and his background to unify the Grand Xia.
Mighty Immortal Tigerfang, however, had completely relied on his own
personal power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“if I didn’t rely
on the Heaven Punisher Formation, I probably wouldn’t be a match
for him either,” Ning chuckled. The Three Realms had many Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals, the most supreme of which all had formations
of their own that were comparable to the Heaven Punisher Formation.
In this regard, none of them were able to overcome Ning. But in a
purely one-on-one fight…there indeed quite a few who were stronger
than Ning. In fact, in his very own school, Mount Innerheart, there
were a number of fellow disciples who were superior to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow, Patriarch Lu,
Immortal Tigerfang…they were at the very precipice of becoming True
Gods or Daofathers. In terms of the Dao or in terms of techniques,
they were significantly superior to Ning. Ning had to admit to their
superiority in these areas. He simply hadn’t spent enough time
cultivating, and his mind had been focused on cultivating his
swordforce and heartforce. After all, he simply didn’t have enough
time slowly meditate on many Daos in the midst of this great storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, be wary
of the Seamless Gate,” Ninefangs cautioned mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Ning said. Once they entered the Tigerfang, Ning had immediately sent
his heartforce out to cover the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
currently quite cautious. When I was in Sword Immortal world, there
was someone using his coresense to watch over me at all times. They
probably knew the moment I left the world. Although Tigerfang world
has quite a few bases of the Seamless Gate, only one of them has
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. That base has a total of nineteen.
They should’ve just hurried over there a short while ago. If
nineteen Empyrean Gods and True Immortals hide behind protective
formations…there’s no way for me to breach their defenses at
all.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, however,
Ning sighed. He had succeeded in his first ambush, but it would now
be far more difficult for him to give the Seamless Gate a few more
vicious cuts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, try again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tired already? Is
this all you have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Voices could be heard
from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to sweep
towards that area with his gaze. Far away, there was a village
located next to the side of the river. The villagers relied on the
river to make their living. Within the village, there was a tall,
muscular, fur-clad man who was training a youth in using the sword.
The muscular man was calling out repeatedly, “Come on! Hit harder!
Hit smarter! Your sword-arts need to be more direct and forceful. All
those fancy flourishes are useless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The youth’s
sword came chopping down, but he instantly was knocked flying. He
landed on the ground, then quickly and grimly clambered to his feet
and charged forward again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time they
collided, he was knocked flying. Each time he was knocked flying, he
rose to his feet. And each time, the tall man continued to berate
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched this scene
from afar, aboard his boat. He could tell that the man and the youth
looked similar; most likely, they were father and son. This scene
caused Ning to think of how his own father, Ji Yichuan, had taught
him how to use the sword all those years ago. Compared to the tall
man, however, Ning’s father’s sword-arts were slightly superior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…in terms of
actual power, this man wasn’t any weaker than Ning’s father had
been. This was because this man had already reached the Zifu level.
His only weakness was that his sword-arts were a bit weaker than
Yichuan’s had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is quite an
ordinary little village, but this man is a Zifu Disciple. It seems
he’s brought his son here to live in seclusion,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Father was still
alive…if I could still train in the sword alongside Father…how
wonderful it would be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning rose to
his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord!”
Ninefangs immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a single step
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He instantly appeared
next to the tall man and the youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Feng stared in
astonishment at the white-robed youth who had suddenly appeared.
Although he had been training with his son, as a Zifu Disciple he had
kept a continuous watch on the surrounding area. He had seen long ago
that a wooden boat had appeared a few kilometers away, drifting about
on the river, and he had also noticed the white-robed youth who was
seated on the boat, drinking wine, but…that youth had suddenly
appeared before him in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No spatial ripples.
It wasn’t teleportation.” Although Bu Feng was merely a Zifu
Disciple, he had come from a major school. “He relied simply on
pure speed to instantly arrive here…and the wind around us is still
very calm and gentle. Skill like this…not even Primal Daoists can
accomplish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
mud-splattered youth looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yun’er!” Bu Feng
barked. The youth was instantly terrified, no longer daring to make a
sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, simply
smiled towards the tall man. “Don’t panic. I’ve just come to
compete with you in sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compete?” Bu Feng
was completely flabbergasted. Was this a joke?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just come on,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Feng didn’t dare
to disobey. This person could probably wipe him out with a single
finger! He immediately suppressed all of his other thoughts, focusing
entirely on the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, then!”
A heavy sword suddenly appeared in front of Bu Feng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out with
his two hands, and a pair of longswords suddenly manifested in front
of him. These longswords had been formed by Ning out of natural
energy; at his level, any swords he casually created would be far
tougher than Mortal-ranked swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this, Bu
Feng felt even more stunned and terrified. “What the hell is this
senior playing at?” But he didn’t dare to hesitate at all. He
immediately activated his Zifu-level ki, sending his heavy sword
howling forward like a streak of light as he stabbed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s twin swords
instantly seemed to transform into flowing water as the heavy sword
came stabbing towards him. He blocked multiple times in succession,
but was still knocked flying backwards. In fact, after he landed on
the ground, he actually staggered back a few steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father seems to be
very afraid of this white-robed man, but why is it that he seems so
weak?” The mud-splattered youth was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
Bu Feng, however, couldn’t even believed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he softly
mused to himself, “It seems as though when using Houtian-level
strength to execute my sword-arts…even I will find it very
difficult to resist the magic treasures of a Zifu Disciple.” He
hadn’t used any spells of silence, and so Zifu Disciple Bu Feng was
able to hear what he said. Bu Feng couldn’t help but feel
speechless; the man had merely used Houtian-level strength to resist
the treasures of a Zifu Disciple?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houtian, Xiantian,
Zifu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gap between each
level was enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Feng didn’t dare
to disobey. He immediately launched yet another attack. His heavy
sword, controlled by his Zifu-level ki, attacked with absolutely
savagery. However, although Ning’s sword-arts seemed simple, they
went straight to the essence of the sword. In truth, Ning would be
able to manifest swordforce from his longswords with but a thought,
but if he did that, there was no way this fight could continue. Thus,
Ning forcibly kept all of his power suppressed, ensuring that his
strength would be no more than that of a Houtian-level expert. This
naturally meant that his even the speed of his sword had dropped
drastically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword was slow and
weak; he had to completely rely on his sword-arts in order to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, his foe
was merely a Zifu Disciple, and Ning’s own understanding of the
sword was far greater than his foe’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that this sudden whim of mine would have actually…” Ning had
never experienced something like this before. He kept himself at a
Houtian’s strength, with his foe’s heavy sword completely
eclipsing Ning’s swords in both speed and power. The end result was
that Ning was forced to use every single scrap of skill and talent he
had in order to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had a feeling…that
he was improving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had found the right
path! Through this path, he might be able to break through this
bottleneck and reach an even higher level of sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful. How
can sword-arts be this marvelous, this miraculous? T-this…this is
impossible.” Bu Feng frantically unleashed all the most powerful
sword-arts he had, and in fact he even began to use some of the rare,
unique flying sword techniques he had learned. That way, the
mysterious white-robed youth in front of him would reveal even more
sword-arts for him to see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts of this
white-robed youth had completely broadened his horizons. It was as
though an entire new universe had appeared before him. He discovered,
for the first time…that the sword could be used in manners like
this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because Ning continued to use a mere Houtian’s speed and strength
that a Zifu Disciple like Bu Feng was able to see all these things
clearly. However, although he was able to see it clearly, he still
felt that it was all unspeakably arcane. Even the simplest of
sword-stances caused Bu Feng to feel befuddled, no matter how hard he
worked to comprehend it as he continued to unleash more attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, despite
that…he could sense that his own insights into the sword were
rising nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Karmic luck. A
tremendous stroke of karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Bu Feng, was
forced to flee with my son…but I actually ended up stumbling into
such a tremendous stroke of karmic luck. The Dao of the Sword…I can
embark upon the Dao of the Sword. I can reach a higher level of
understanding, and I’ll be able to quickly become a Wanxiang Adept
or even a Primal Daoist. By then, I’ll be able to go back. I’ll
rescue my woman. I’ll…” Bu Feng’s heart was filled with wild
joy…but he then immediately suppressed all other thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He focused all of his
efforts on attacking Ning, while also doing his very best to memorize
some of Ning’s sword-stances. Although these were all techniques
which Ning casually came up with and displayed on the spot, to Bu
Feng these stances were like a pegasus soaring through the skies in a
bold, unconstrained manner. Every single technique was incomparably
exquisite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a peerless
genius of the Dao of the Sword who had long ago mastered it. Right
now, his foundation was the [Five Treasures] sword-art, a sword-art
which surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos themselves. For
someone who was studying the art of the sword, even the tiniest part
of Ning’s insight was enough to give that person limitless
benefits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps…perhaps
this is the true essence of the sword. Forget about heartforce…forget
about swordforce…forget about all outside sources of power and
strength…only then can you truly find what the essence of the sword
truly is. The [Five Treasures] sword-art is something which truly
guides one towards the very essence of the sword itself. Yes…from
today onwards, I shall roam the Three Realms, competing against
countless people with the sword.” As a ray of clarity suddenly
shone down upon Ning, Ning immediately came to his decision.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Feng and Ji Ning
battled for a full day and night. Empyrean God Ninefangs used a
technique to completely separate this area from the outside world,
ensuring that the commoners in the village wouldn’t be able to see
the battle. The only ones that could see were Ninefangs and the
mud-splattered youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huff. Huff. Huff. Bu
Feng’s face was turning pale as he panted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been working
hard to unleash as much power as he could. The ki in his Zifu region
had long ago been used up, and so he had been using spirit-pills to
replenish it. Finally, the last of his spirit-pills was gone, causing
him to mentally panic. He knew very well that spirit-pills weren’t
worth a damn, compared to this chance to spar against this mysterious
figure. This was a tremendous opportunity for him, and he wanted to
make use of it to fight for a bit longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You can
stop now,” Ning said. He could sense that his opponent’s attacks
had grown quite weak; the man was clearly out of ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Feng had no choice
but to stop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are some
spirit-pills for you to replenish your ki with.” Ning tossed a
bottle of spirit-pills to him. Bu Feng hurriedly accepted the bottle,
and as he took a look inside, he was instantly shocked and overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens…not even
Primal Daoists would be able to produce as many pills as this! What
he didn’t realize was that this was something Ning had acquired
when he had slaughtered countless Immortals and Fiendgods during the
Realmwar. Back then, every single White-Faced Flood Dragon he had
slain contained a hundred thousand Loose Immortals, each of who had
been carrying a large amount of Immortal pills with them as they
fought. Ning had simply pulled out a random bottle, one which
belonged to a Loose Immortal. To a puny Zifu Disciple like Bu Feng,
however, this was something that utterly shocked and overwhelmed him
with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, I can keep
fighting,” Bu Feng said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve had enough,”
Ning said with a laugh. “Ninefangs, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Manorlord,”
Ninefangs said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The white-robed
youth and the bald old servant disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Bu Feng
was incredibly agitated. This bottle of pills was probably comparable
in value to the entire fortune of an average Primal Daoist. This
would give him the resources he needed, and the mysterious, profound
sword-stances had had managed to memorize would serve as lamp-posts
that would guide him on his Immortal path! He would be able to able
to walk much farther along his path, and would be able to make his
dreams a reality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father?” The
mud-splattered youth looked at Bu Feng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go home,
right away!” Bu Feng said hurriedly. He immediately pulled his son
back into their home within the village. He wanted to immediately and
fully memorize and record the many sword-arts he had seen during the
battle, for fear that he might forget them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the days to come, Bu
Feng continued to teach his son sword-play. Eventually, he would
manage to gain a basic level of insight into the Grand Dao of the
Sword. Sixteen years later, when Bu Feng returned to his former
school, he was already an expert of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a wooden boat
within the river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord, the
techniques you put on display came from the [Five Treasures]
sword-art, a technique that surpasses the Heavenly Daos which was
created by the number one Sword Immortal in the history of the Three
Realms. Learning even the tiniest little morsel of that sword-art
represents a tremendous stroke of karmic luck for that Zifu
Disciple,” Ninefangs said. He had personally witnessed the mighty
power of the [Five Treasures] sword-art. Generally speaking, not even
Celestial Immortals could endure seeing the power and majesty
contained within the full sword-art. As for a few scattered
techniques and stances…even if they saw it, they wouldn’t be able
to understand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had personally put
the sword-art on display, and had sparred with Bu Feng for a long
period of time, which was why Bu Feng had managed to understand how
truly formidable these sword-stances truly were. Naturally, it had
been much easier for him to understand them than others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I gained some
insights of my own,” Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, after
spending just an hour sparring against Bu Feng, Ning had already been
able to completely understand and defeat all of Bu Feng’s stances.
The reason why Ning had spent a full day and night fighting against
him was because he was testing new ideas and gaining new insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three thousand
kilometers from here, there’s a Zifu Disciple who is quite skilled
in longsword techniques. Come.” Ning’s heartforce had already
discovered a Zifu Disciple three thousand kilometers away who was
training in quite an extraordinary flying sword technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a distant mountain
peak. A scarred, gray-robed woman was standing here, controlling a
flying sword from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a white-robed
youth and an old, bald servant appeared next to her out of thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The scarred
woman was badly shocked, but she hurriedly said respectfully,
“Respectful greetings to you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use your flying
sword to attack me at full force,” the white-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh?” The scarred
woman was stunned. This mysterious figure was very strange! Still,
she didn’t dare to refuse, and so she immediately began to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, day
after day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
Godking continued to maintain a close watch over Ning, taking a look
at him every so often. After half a month of doing so, the Godking
finally ran out of patience. To him, Ji Ning wasn’t a true threat,
after all, just a troublemaker. The truly dangerous figures in the
Three Realms were the True Gods and Daofathers of the Nuwa Alliance,
as well as the many preparations they were making in secret for the
Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is actually
dueling some laughably weak cultivators in order to train in the
sword? What a joke. Even if he gains any insights, how strong could
they be?” The Godking could no longer be bothered to pay any more
attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Day after day. Month
after month. Year after year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning roamed the Three
Realms. Although low-level Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang Adepts were
weak, different places had different battle styles. In the trillion
minor worlds in particular, the differences in combat styles were
particularly noticeable. In fact, there were certain sword-art
techniques which caused even Ning to feel tongue-tied and speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sparred against
countless combatants and against countless styles. He never used any
of his Immortal energy, his heartforce, his swordforce, or anything
else. He simply relied on his Houtian-level strength to battle
against the Zifu Disciples, and on Xiantian-level strength to battle
against the Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning to
gain quite a few more insights into the [Five Treasures] sword-art.
His many clones were all focused on meditating and visualizing new
techniques, extracting the essence of his insights from battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine years later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was within a
beautifully scenic minor world. This minor world was in a very remote
region, but occasionally Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms
would pass by here, as did Ning. However, this was a place with many
people; in terms of population size, it was comparable to Ning’s
previous home of ‘Earth’. Here, experts were divided into several
different ranks; Mortal-rank, Earth-rank, Heaven-rank, and the
Legend-rank. In truth, this was essentially equivalent to the
Houtian, Xiantian, Zifu, and Wanxiang levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The energy cultivation
methods in this world were extremely coarse. Anyone who was able to
reach the ‘Legend’ level was actually comparable to the Primal
Daoists of the Grand Xia in terms of their insights into the Dao. In
fact, some Legends had even mastered a complete Dao. It was precisely
because they had such deep insights into the Dao that they were able
to forcibly train their way into the Wanxiang level, despite having
such terrible energy cultivation methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforge Mountain
Villa. This was viewed as a sacred place within this minor world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lord of the
Swordforge Mountain Villa was given the exalted title of Sword Saint!
He was a Legend, and the entire world only held three Legends. Sword
Saint, however, was publicly acknowledged as the most powerful of the
three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirteen disciples were
standing there respectfully. In front of them was a middle-aged man
dressed in simple clothes who was seated in the lotus position. This
middle-aged man was Sword Saint! The number one expert of the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These thirteen
disciples were thirteen of the ‘Fifteen Celestial Swords’ of
Sword Saint’s school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Number six, you
first,” Sword Saint said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,” the
sixth disciple said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth and
an old, bald man suddenly appeared next to them. Because Sword Saint
was seated facing them, he was the first to see them appear out of
nowhere. His face instantly changed. “How could they have suddenly
appeared here without me detecting them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the look on
Sword Saint’s face, the thirteen disciples all followed his gaze.
They also saw the youth and the old servant, and they too were
startled. However, although they were startled, they didn’t panic.
This was because everyone knew that Sword Saint was the undisputed
number one expert in the world. Still, it was true that there were
some people who were especially skilled in stealth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth disciple
instantly barked, “This is a restricted area of the Swordforge
Mountain Village. Who are you two! Report your names!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
however, just looked towards Sword Saint. “I heard that you are the
strongest person in this world, and that your sword-arts are the
best. Use your sword and display your strongest sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you hea-”
The thirteen disciples all grew angry…but Ninefangs just glanced at
them, then said softly, “Sleep.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud. Thud. Thud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirteen disciples
all collapsed, having fallen asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene completely
stunned Sword Saint. The majority of his thirteen disciples were all
at the Heaven-rank, but they were all actually sent into a deep
slumber in an instant? An ability like this was utterly
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. If this was a
major world, things wouldn’t be such a pain.” Ning shook his
head, then released his aura. Instantly, Sword Saint felt as though
he was nothing more than an ant drowning within a sea that was vaster
than the heavens themselves. In fact, he could sense that his body
couldn’t even move in the presence of this boundless aura of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, Ning
finally retracted his aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t reveal a
bit of his power, most likely this ‘Sword Saint’, who had long
ago become accustomed to being the ‘number one in the world’,
wouldn’t be able to realize what the situation was in a short
period of time. If they were in a major world, the man most likely
would’ve immediately begin to respectfully address Ning as
‘senior’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack,” Ning
commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, your power
is truly tremendous. I, Woodclear, have roamed the world for a
hundred years. I thought that I was the number one expert in
existence, but now I see that I was nothing more than a frog in a
well gazing towards the heavens.” Sword Saint looked towards Ning.
“Over the course of my many years, I have developed a technique
known as the Ninety-Nine Swordforged Swords. Please have a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he knew the
difference in power between them, his many years of pride at being
the ‘best in the world’ compelled him to want to prove himself
through his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was completely
stunned and speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s able to block
my sword-arts while merely using Earth-ranked strength and speed?”
Sword Saint was truly dazed. He was proudest of his accomplishments
in sword-arts, but compared with the youth before him…this youth
used seemingly-simple stances, but no matter how hard Sword Saint
tried, he simply couldn’t understand or comprehend any of them.
Still, he was unconsciously inspired in many ways by this battle, and
in the short period of time they sparred, he had already come up with
several different sword-arts in his mind, all of which were far more
powerful than the ‘Ninety-Nine Swordforged Swords’ he had spent
so many years working on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although this ‘Sword
Saint’ is from a minor world, he’s really quite strong. He’s
mastered an ordinary Dao, and he’s even gained a basic level of
insight into the Grand Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the Wanxiang
Adepts I’ve dueled, this is the one with the best sword-arts thus
far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very cautious.
He continued to use Xiantian-level strength against Wanxiang Adepts,
but he naturally was beginning to choose increasingly powerful
Wanxiang Adepts to fight against. This was the first time that he had
fought against a Wanxiang Adept who had already gained insight into a
Grand Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Ning’s
sword-arts were like a black hole, devouring any and all attacks
which Sword Saint attempted to unleash, no matter how berserk they
were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…my
defensive sword-art is beginning to take embryonic form.” Ning felt
joy in his heart. Over the past few years of dueling, he had gained
an even deeper understanding of the sword. In fact, he began to have
a vague idea of the path that he would take in the future, and the
outlines of a sword-art had begun to take shape in his heart. Ning
could sense that this sword-art would have a total of five different
stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, he
hadn’t developed any of the five senses yet. Today, however, as he
dueled against this ‘Sword Saint’, Ning finally began to gain an
idea of how one of the five stances should be shaped.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms. The
Celestial Realm. The Dao Palace in the eastern regions was
extraordinarily lively on this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many major powers had
gathered here. Even Buddhas Tathagata and Amitabha had arrived to
celebrate, along with many others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastflower, you’ve
finally made your breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Eastflower,
you finally broke through. I’ve been waiting for this day since the
Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Palace was
bustling with activity. The man of honor for this occasion was not
Daoist Three Purities. Rather, it was someone who the Daoist Path had
placed great expectations in…Patriarch Lu, Lu Dongbin. For some
time now, Lu Dongbin had been journeying through the primordial
chaos. Upon returning…everyone discovered that he had already
broken through to reach the Daofather level. Thus, upon his return
almost all the major powers had learned of Lu Dongbin’s
breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi, long time no
see!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers all
chatted amongst themselves in small groups. Some had come in person,
while others had sent their clones or incarnations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti and Fuxi ran
into each other in the Dao Palace. Subhuti had come in person, while
Fuxi had merely sent over a clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastflower caused
quite a stir when he returned from the primordial chaos. It seems he
encountered quite the stroke of karmic luck,” Fuxi said with a
laugh. “And from what I saw…it seems as though Eastflower should
have mastered the fifth level of taiji-force as well. Amazing, truly
amazing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wished to merge
the teachings of Buddhism and Daoism together…Eastflower truly is
an ambitious man.” Subhuti sighed with emotion. “However…it was
precisely because his ambitions were too great that, despite
possessing deep insights in both his previous life as ‘Eastflower’
and his current life as ‘Lu Dongbin’, he remained unable to make
the final breakthrough. This time, thanks to a lucky encounter in the
primordial chaos, he was able to make a fortuitous breakthrough,
merging Buddhism and Daoism into one, with the Taiji supporting him.
Upon making this breakthrough…he has now become one of the top-tier
Daofathers of the Three Realms. No wonder Three Purities, Carefree,
and the others all viewed him with such favor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi nodded as well.
Everyone felt quite moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods and
Daofathers could roughly be divided into three levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level of
power was the level which ordinary True Gods and Daofathers were at.
Most True Gods and Daofathers were on this level, and unless they
made a qualitative, transformative breakthrough, they would find it
very difficult to improve any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level was
the level often described as the ‘top-tier’ level. The Five
Monarchs of the human race, Daofather Carefree, Wargod Xingtian, and
other extraordinarily powerful figures were considered to be on this
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third level was the
‘overlord’ level. This was the level the two leaders of Buddhism
and Daoism were on, along with the three mighty Human Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it was
certain that the likes of Subhuti, Old Man Yuan, and Houyi were
significantly more powerful than the likes of Wargod Xingtian. Most
people usually viewed them as being very close to the ‘overlord’
level, but because their exact power level was a mystery, it was hard
to say if they had reached the ‘overlord’ level or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had managed
to combine his cultivation in both Buddhism and Daoism, and his
taiji-force had reached the fifth level. He definitely had reached
the top-tier Daofather level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been others
who had made such powerful breakthroughs in the past. Xingtian was
another example, as was Houyi, whose breakthrough was even more
ridiculous. Youdu was another example. As an Empyrean God, he had
trained in the [Twelve Heavens Fiendgod] and reached the second
level, and so he had twelve clones that were all equal in strength to
his true body. After he broke through to become a True God, he had
combined his twelve bodies and also become a top-tier Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, what the
Nuwa Alliance had, the Seamless Alliance also had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That disciple of
yours has formidable heartforce,” Fuxi said. “If he can break
through to the fifth stage of heartforce, he’ll instantly have the
power of a top-tier Daofather as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that
easy. Eastflower only succeeded because he’s been building up a
foundation for countless years. Honestly, if it wasn’t because he
was simultaneously training in so many things at once, he probably
would’ve become a Daofather long ago. Eastflower is simply too
ambitious, which is why it took him this long to make his
breakthrough.” Subhuti shook his head. “As for Ji Ning, he hasn’t
trained for long enough. It’s far too difficult for anyone to reach
the fifth stage of heartforce. To be honest, I’ve always felt that
his talent lay more in the sword than in anything else. To this very
day, I feel that way. Compared to the Dao of the Sword, heartforce is
too ephemeral and formless a path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi nodded in
agreement. “How’s he doing in his Dao of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still
building up his experiences,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Here’s
the formation I promised Ji Ning.” Fuxi waved his hand, producing a
bamboo scroll. “I brought it along with me to give to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
naturally aware of Lu Dongbin’s breakthrough. All they could do,
however, was gnash their teeth in silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
gained yet another powerful ally! In truth, they had wanted to get
rid of Lu Dongbin long ago, but he was the True Immortal which the
Daoist Path cared about the most. Everyone knew that given Lu
Dongbin’s cultivation path, he would become incredible as soon as
he made that final breakthrough, and so the Daoist Path had treated
them as a precious treasure. In addition, Lu Dongbin hadn’t been as
suicidal as Ning, and so the Seamless Gate had never had the chance
to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For him to make his
breakthrough just as the storm arrives…Lu Dongbin is going to be a
threat. Still…in the end, victory will be decided in the Endwar.”
The Godking was absolutely furious, but on the whole was still calm
and level-headed about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this war between the
two alliances, the addition of a single top-tier Daofather was
something they could still handle. If, however, an overlord-level
Daofather was to appear within the Daoist Path…he really would go
crazy with shock and rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had all but
forgotten about Ji Ning by now. Based on Ji Ning’s current actions,
it seemed as though Ning was completely focused on training in
swordplay and was no longer going to ambush the Seamless Gate. “Ji
Ning has finally wised up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news that a new
Daofather had been born was mainly circulated amongst the major
powers themselves. Very, very few Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
knew of this matter. Because Ning was completely focused on his
training with the sword, Subhuti didn’t tell him about this matter.
In fact, he wasn’t even in a rush to give Fuxi’s formation to
Ning. “It’ll be easy for him to learn this formation. This
disciple of mine is currently wandering the Three Realms, training in
the sword like a madman. It’s best if I don’t bother him for now.
After he’s completed his training, I’ll give it to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti’s judgment
was quite accurate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had indeed entered
a berserk state. When he had mastered the Dao of the Sword, he had
just reached the first stage of swordforce. Upon reaching the second
stage of swordforce, a new world had opened up before his eyes. And
so, Ning wandered the Three Realms, constantly training and competing
against others in swordplay. He began to gain an increasingly clear
picture of the path he had to take. As for all the insights he
gained, he merged all of them into those five stances he had
visualized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The essence of all
sword-stances in the world, including those of the [Five Treasures],
can be merged into these five stances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-art that
I, Ji Ning, will create…let it be called the [Brightmoon]
sword-art. In the many years to come, I will spend much of my time
constantly improving and perfecting these five stances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what Ning’s
idea, for these five sword-stances to encompass all the mysteries of
swordplay which the Three Realms contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, sword-arts
were quite simple when broken down. The most fundamental
sword-stances were to chop, pierce, scrape, sweep, break, tap,
cleave, support, intercept, twist, lift, draw, and sheath. Although
they were seemingly simple…like the Dao itself, these simple
concepts gave birth to countless different things, and were capable
of transforming into infinitely powerful sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on his own
experiences, Ning had come up with five all-encompassing stances.
Strictly speaking, these five stances represented five different
types of sword-intent; what mattered the most was the intent, not the
actual technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteenth year of
Ning’s training with the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!” A
Primal-level Fiendgod roared as he charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using
Zifu-level strength to fight back with a sword in each hand. When his
sword struck out, it was like a black hole had been created, draining
and weakening his opponent’s massive strength. No matter how fast
the opponent attacked, he remained unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the Fiendgod’s
own power was beginning to work against him. He couldn’t help but
stagger back by two steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five stances of
the bright moon…I didn’t expect that the first one to take form
would be this one. I shall call it ‘Soleheart’.” Ning nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Brightmoon]
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had named it after
his daughter. His decision to do so reflected the fact that to Ning,
she was that which he had to protect above all others!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Soleheart
stance’ of the five stances of the bright moon was a sword-art that
was meant for defending in a one-on-one battle. It represented the
most profound insights Ning had gained in defensive sword-arts. When
his sword struck out, it was as though a black hole had formed that
would absorb and trap the enemy’s strength. But of course, this
sword-art was still very crude and unfinished…but it was still the
most powerful sword-art which Ning currently possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning silently and
soundlessly reached the third stage of swordforce. However, Ning
actually didn’t care too much about that. The only thing in his
heart right now was his [Brightmoon] sword-art. This sword-art
represented the crystallization of all his blood, sweat, and effort.
This would be the true foundation of his sword-arts in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after creating all
five sword-stances would Ning rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I’ve finally
subdued that True Immortal Winterpeak.” Ning suddenly cracked a
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ice-locked
stone stele that was located deep within a gorge of an icy star that
was within the infinite primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prisonworld 17.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight lotus petals were
high in the sky, facing the ground as they continued to unleash eight
streams of truefire. The streams of truefire completely filled the
ground beneath the lotus petals, blazing away at a bowl-shaped
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
located outside the restrictive formation, eyes closed as he
continued to meditate on his sword-arts. Every so often, he would add
in a little bit more energy to keep the treasure active.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his opponent
was ‘only’ a Pure Yang True Immortal, this sort of top-tier True
Immortal was comparable to the Daofathers of the Three Realms! Once
he hide himself under the bowl-shaped magic treasure and began to
fill it with his energy to defend against the eight blazing streams
of truefire…he had been able to hold on for fifteen full years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I…admit defeat.”
The embarrassed, enraged, and resentful voice of True Immortal
Winterpeak finally rang out from underneath the bowl-shaped treasure.
His energy and his pills had all been used up. He would at most be
able to endure for another three days.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 40 - Raking It In
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning waved his hand,
and the eight downward-facing petals instantly withdrew their streams
of truefire. The eight petals then shrank in size and flew back into
Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh, as the saying
goes, it looks like you ‘wouldn’t shed tears until you saw your
coffin’. You knew that you were eventually going to die if you
fought against me, but you still just had to fight against me until
now.” Still, Ning had to sigh at how strong his foe was. Ning had
eight types of truefire to rely on, while the enemy had to actively
control a magic treasure to defend; this True Immortal was using up
far more energy than him, but thanks to his Daofather-equivalent
level of power, he had been able to survive for fifteen years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
see how vast a gulf in power there lay between Ning and a Daofather.
If it wasn’t for the fact that this person was imprisoned, there
was no way Ning could’ve forced him to bow his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The bowl-shaped
magic treasure disappeared, and True Immortal Winterpeak reappeared.
A hint of anger and humiliation was in his eyes as he stared at Ning.
“I admit defeat. I…I’m willing…to serve…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humiliation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of
complicated emotions filled his mind. For him to prostrate himself
before Ji Ning was like having Ji Ning prostrate himself before a
Celestial Immortal! Experts had their own pride and arrogance.
Fortunately, he had been imprisoned here for many chaos cycles, which
had whittled it away a bit; otherwise, he would probably would’ve
chosen to die rather than to bow his head. Even the current-him had
spent fifteen years resisting before submitting after realizing that
he had already reached the end of the line.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need to
feel so upset,” Ning said. “I’m unable to allow you to leave
your prison cell, and so you’ll continue to live here as before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak knew that
Ning was trying to ‘console’ him and make him more pliable and
less resistant. He said calmly, “What do you wish for me to do? Do
you want magic treasures? Or to ask me certain questions? I can give
you any treasures you desire; imprisoned here, they are of no use to
me anyways.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need you to not
resist me whatsoever. Open up your soul to me. Let me see your
memories,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…”
Winterpeak’s face completely changed. “Overseer, don’t go too
far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a mere memory
search,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak ground his
teeth as he stared at Ning. “Impossible! I can give you all of my
magic treasures, but a soulscouring…impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To completely open up
his soul meant that this person would know everything about him. He
wouldn’t be able to fight back against a Chaos Immortal or World
God who wished to do this to him, but this person was far weaker than
he was. To completely expose himself in such a manner to a weakling?
An expert like Winterpeak truly couldn’t accept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To you, I’m
nothing more than an outsider,” Ning said. “Those private
memories of yours are useless to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak shut his
eyes. Memories and scenes began to flash through his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandfather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would never be able
to forget these people. These were the most important people in his
life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom had truly been destroyed, but even so, perhaps some of
the important people in his life were still alive. He wanted to go
see them, go search for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Winterpeak
opened his eyes. He looked coldly at Ning. “I accept…but I
imagine you wouldn’t dare to come inside and soulscour me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
chuckled, then immediately stretched out his arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! His arm
instantly expanded to become hundreds of kilometers long, stretching
out to land on Winterpeak’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coward,”
Winterpeak sneered. “Even after training in the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods], you are still so cowardly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If a prisoner like
you was to suddenly wipe out one of my clones in a desperation
attack…that really wouldn’t be worth it for me.” Ning stood
there outside the formation, but his incredibly long arm had reached
Winterpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if his foe wanted
to suddenly counter-attack, Ning could instantly and voluntarily
separate that arm. The severing of an arm would only result in the
loss of some divine power, and in fact some of the divine power from
the arm would make it back to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.”
Winterpeak shut his eyes, still seated in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s hand was
pressed against the top of Winterpeak’s head. He began to invade
the man’s soul…and Winterpeak didn’t fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, magnificent
scenes of an expert’s rise to power began to appear before Ning. As
a top-tier True Immortal, Winterpeak’s life experiences had been
far more exciting than those of the Empyrean Gods and Celestial
Immortals, and his status had been much higher as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full day and a night
passed before Ning withdrew his hand. He closed his eyes in thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems…there
really is no hope of gaining a top-tier Jindan.” Ning sighed to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had
expected this, after searching through Winterpeak’s memories Ning
became certain of it. To form a first-class Jindan, one of the
prerequisites was that a Chaos Immortal had to be by your side,
assisting you. In addition, in Pangaea the technique of forming a
first-class Jindan was only known to the three World-level experts!
Not even Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals were qualified to learn
this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second-class
Jindans…there were quite a few who knew the technique for this,
including True Gods and True Immortals. Winterpeak, however, was not
one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This made sense. The
Jindan-creation techniques were only needed by mortals who wanted to
train to become Celestial Immortals! Ji Ning, for example, had long
ago become a Pure Yang True Immortal; these techniques really were of
no use to him. The reason why Ning had searched for more information
about them was so that he would be able to transmit them to
Brightmoon and the others, assuming they all survived this great
storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And there truly are
very few ways of upgrading a True Immortal’s Jindan.” Ning shook
his head. A Jindan upgrade method was what Ning truly want. However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, these upgrade
methods were also fairly valuable as well. This was because there
were some Immortals in backwater regions who were incredibly
talented, but who had already become Celestial Immortals or True
Immortals using inferior methods. The various powers in the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom would often recruit them, then work with them to
upgrade their Jindans. Still, since even the best techniques only
allowed them to upgrade the Jindans to the second tier, they weren’t
THAT valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all the True
Gods and True Immortals imprisoned here possessed the most elite
level of power at their rank. They had incredibly high statuses, and
so there was a chance that some of them knew these techniques. The
chances that an Elder God or an Ancestral Immortal knew these
techniques were even higher, but alas there was nothing Ning could do
to any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take it
slow. If I can’t find it from one True Immortal, I’ll go find a
second True God or True Immortal. Ten…a hundred…I’ll just keep
searching. Eventually, I’ll definitely succeed.” Ning then looked
towards Winterpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you find what
you wanted?” Winterpeak looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me your
‘Flashing Skystars’,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winterpeak ground his
teeth. “You’ve already soulscoured me. Now, you want my
Protocosmic spirit-treasure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand it over,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Winterpeak
truly didn’t want to give it up, but he waved his hand. Instantly,
a large amount of eight-cornered, deep-blue stars appeared in midair.
There were a total of ninety-nine of them, and each of them seemed to
contain the vast skies within them. This was the most important
treasure which Winterpeak possessed, a Protocosmic spirit-treasure
set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.”
Winterpeak dispersed his soul imprint on the treasure set, then
tossed it towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s hand expanded
to become three hundred meters in size as he caught the various
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is a bottle of
Immortal pills and a message talisman. The pills should be enough for
you to stay alive for a period of time. If there’s anything urgent,
you can shatter the talisman to summon me.” Ning waved his hand,
tossing our these two items. Winterpeak immediately accepted them. He
had completely used up his spirit-pills; this was exactly what he
needed right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Winterpeak
gave the items a look, then snorted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that this
person was feeling rather frustrated after having been soulscoured,
then forced to hand over his most powerful treasure. Thus, Ning
didn’t quibble about his attitude, instead transforming into a
streak of light and departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from True
Immortal Winterpeak’s memories, hierarchical stratification is
extremely strict in Pangaea.” Ning flew forward atop a cloud,
thinking to himself. “True Gods and True Immortals all generally
use Protocosmic spirit-treasures, but only first-class True Immortals
like Winterpeak are allowed to use entire sets of Protocosmic
treasures, such as these ninety-nine stars.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most importantly of
all, Pangaea actually has methods of producing even higher-class
treasures.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it was
actually quite simple to upgrade the power of a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure. The method was to add more seals into the treasure
itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own Goldstar Beads
of the Heavens, for example, had the nine chaos seals infused into
them. This was a method strengthening spirit-treasures…but of
course, you had to be capable of binding and infusing the necessary
seals! Or, for another example, Daoist Three Purities had devised his
Immortal Slaying Swords’ sword-diagrams using a total of seven
seals. The more profound the seals were, the more powerful they would
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This set of ‘Flashing
Skystars’ also contained seals within them, and their power was
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…this set
of treasures isn’t a good fit for me,” Ning murmured softly to
himself. “Still, the more treasures my side has, the stronger my
side will become. I have to take away all the Protocosmic
spirit-treasures these True Gods and True Immortals have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
only some of the major powers had access to Chaos treasures…and the
majority of them weren’t meant for combat! Thus, the absolute vast
majority of major powers still used Protocosmic spirit-treasures in
battle. Treasures like the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens were
actually rather useless to most major powers. For Ning, of course,
the beads were quite suitable, thanks to his powerful heartforce. To
the others, however, treasures like the Flashing Skystars were more
valuable, and the seals they contained inside them would delight
quite a few major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can trade this to
the Emperors of Mankind for other treasures,” Ning mused. “Once I
acquire a few more treasures, I’ll go and do a trade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperors of
Mankind, the Daoist Path, and the Buddhist Sangha all had vast
treasuries. If he went with treasures of his own, he could trade the
ones he didn’t need for ones which he could. But of course, the
value had to be equivalent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the storm had
descended, all of the various headquarters of the Nuwa Alliance had
placed the various items they didn’t need within those treasuries,
including many precious materials, Chaos ingredients, Immortal pills,
and other things. That way, members of their alliance could trade for
what they needed, making the alliance as a whole grow more powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I succeeded against
a True Immortal. Now…let me see if I can deal with a True God.”
Ning’s cloud flew straight towards a large mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the mountain,
there was an emaciated, green-haired man seated in the lotus
position. As soon as Ning landed, the man opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a True God!”
Ning felt a bit breathless. The True Gods of the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom were comparable to the True Gods of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Overseer?” The
green-haired man’s eyes were as sharp as a hawk’s as he carefully
scrutinized Ning. “What happened to Pangaea? Why have they sent
you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The chaos-kingdom of
Pangaea has already been destroyed.” Ning stood there atop the
mountain as he spoke. “I am now in control of the entire
prisonworld. You have two choices before you. The first is to resist
me. The second is to submit to me. Just now, True Immortal Winterpeak
submitted to me, and I have already acquired his Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, the ‘Flashing Skystars’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed the
ninety-nine deep-blue eight-sided stars that were hovering above his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
narrowed his eyes. “Winterpeak, that useless piece of…he actually
submitted to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you?” Ning
looked at him calmly.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
let out a snort, then shut his eyes. He just sat there at the
mountain top, not moving at all, as though he couldn’t even be
bothered to pay any attention to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…I have no choice but to attack.” Ning shook his head, then
waved his hand. A streak of sword-light instantly slashed across the
skies, leaving behind an enduring scar in the heavens. This
sword-strike looked simple, but Ning had filled it with his
fourth-stage heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It instantly traversed
hundreds of kilometers and stabbed directly against the green-haired
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though it had
stabbed into a magic treasure. A ringing sound could be heard, but
the green-haired man didn’t even budge. He opened his eyes,
glancing sideways at Ning, then smirked. “Is that all you have? I
can just sit here, and you won’t be able to harm me at all. Hurry
up and beat it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning shook
his head and laughed. “Although the power of that sword-attack
wasn’t great, if you didn’t resist its power at all, you would’ve
been knocked flying. Don’t tell me you didn’t use up any of your
divine power at all in order to ensure that you were able to sit
there without budging an inch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew exactly how
powerful his sword-attack had been. A minor world like Earth probably
would’ve been smashed into dust by it! Even if his enemy’s body
was as tough and unbreakable as a magic treasure, once a blow of such
power landed it should’ve been knocked flying, just as a magic
treasure would have been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I have the
body of a True God. You can’t possibly damage it at all,” the
green-haired man said calmly. “I simply care about my image and my
face. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t use up any divine power
at all, no matter how you strike me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None? What a joke!
Any expert, no matter how formidable, has to use up divine power or
Immortal energy to stay alive.” Ning smirked. “Ki Refiners use up
their ki energy, while you need to use up your divine power. Why are
you so emaciated? Isn’t it precisely because you are trying to
conserve your divine power? Even if I don’t act against you…in a
few chaos cycles, your divine power will be used up and you’ll
still die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man’s
face turned ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All living creatures
had to use up energy to stay alive! The reason why Gods and Immortals
could stay alive was because they were able to absorb the natural
energy of Heaven and Earth. If, for example, they were trapped in
primordial chaos without being able to draw upon either the energy of
chaos or natural energy, they would die after their Immortal pills
were all used up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to stay
alive, you have to continue to use up your divine power. Every attack
I launch against you will speed that process up. Let’s see how long
you can hang on for.” Ning stretched out his right hand. A lotus
flower appeared within it, and then the eight petals of the flower
quickly flew into the air above the mountain peak. They transformed
to become three thousand meters in size, then began to swivel facing
the ground. The petals bloomed open, releasing streaks of flame that
roared downwards like divine dragons, completely covering the area
where the green-haired man was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight streams of
truefire blazed around the green-haired man, but he was able to
easily resist their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop wasting your
time and effort,” the green-haired man growled. “These flames
can’t hurt me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. I have
plenty of time.” Ning responded coldly, “Your divine power will
be consumed quite quickly by my Eight Fires Qiankun World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
had an ugly look on his face. His divine body was comparable to a
Pure Yang artifact; in hardness, it was comparable to Ning’s own
body, after he had mastered the complete [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
Although this True God had access to an even better protective
ability, that divine ability required even greater resources, and so
he hadn’t been able to master it yet. Thus, his body was like a
magic treasure, but even untouched magic treasures would eventually
decay and break apart after the passage of multiple chaos cycles.
This was why many of the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals here had
damaged-looking clothes. They only needed to use up a little bit of
energy to repair them, but they weren’t willing to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nothing could truly
exist perpetually. Even chaosworlds would eventually decay and
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning battled, he
allowed people to strike his body with impunity, and it could be
described as ‘not using up divine power’. But in truth,
everything used up energy and power. Even speaking used up power!
However, the amount of power consumed was very tiny. At Ning’s
level, the enormous amount of energy he could draw from the natural
world with a single breath was more than enough to render irrelevant
the amount which he had lost!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit. Shit!” The
green-haired man’s face was ugly. He had been imprisoned here for a
long time. He had slowed down the rate at which he used up his divine
power, allowing him to stay alive for a long period of time. However,
the Eight Fires Qiankun World was capable of burning Empyrean Gods to
death. Although True Gods wouldn’t die, the amount of divine power
they would be forced to consume to defend against it was very
significant! By comparison, he was now using using up his divine
power at an explosively greater speed than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was in the
outside world, he would be able to replenish his lost energy tenfold
with but a single breath. But alas…here, there was no source of
energy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Submit to me and
you’ll have a chance to leave this place in the future,” Ning
said calmly. “Continue to resist…hmph. Your only exit will be
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. This treasure
with fire inside it…” The green-haired man was both frustrated
and nervous. “This Overseer can rely on these eight types of fire
to attack me while using up very little energy, and he can go to the
outside world whenever he needs to in order to replenish his power.
I, however, am stuck here. Who the hell came up with this treasure,
anyhow? These eight types of fire are clearly quite weak, but when
they are combined they actually become as powerful as this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing that the
green-haired man wasn’t responding to him, Ning fell silent as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was yet another
who ‘wouldn’t shed tears until he saw his coffin’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and
submit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another clone of Ji
Ning, in another part of the prisonworld, was standing in midair,
surrounded by a bottle, a gourd, a bracelet, and three other types of
magic treasures. These six magic treasures were releasing truefire,
godwind, truewater, and other types of attacks. The world was filled
with fire and water, and a dark wind howled forth. All of the attacks
were aimed at a female True Immortal who was hiding behind the
protection of a magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Winterpeak has already surrendered. If you continue to waste my time
like this…don’t blame me for being merciless!” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman just gave
Ning a cold glare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he could
only sigh to himself. He had two clones here; one was controlling the
Eight Fires Qiankun World, while the other was carrying many other
types of magic treasures. Clearly, the second clone’s treasures
couldn’t compare to the Eight Fires Qiankun World, which was indeed
a perfect treasure to use against these prisoners. It primarily
relied on the truefire it contained, after all; there was very little
need for Ning to use his own energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This process of
sweeping through the people in the prisonworld was guaranteed to be a
slow one. These True Gods and True Immortals were all comparable to
the Daofathers of the Three Realms. Ning would have to use up an
enormous amount of effort to deal with each and every one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, dealing with
these prisoners didn’t use up too much of his mental energy, and so
his clones were all mainly focused on meditating on sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-second year
of Ning roaming the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, senior!”
A Primal-level Fiendgod was wielding two massive warhammers in his
hands. He bound through a forested region as he charged towards Ning,
the trees around him all blasted apart and knocked down by his might.
In fact, some were immediately reduced into dust!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
Ji Ning, held two swords in his hand, and he moved at the speed of a
Zifu-level Fiendgod. His sword-light was like a black hole, drawing a
warhammer aside. And then, with another flash, the sword-light
stabbed towards the Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! A warhammer was
able to block in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was close!”
The Fiendgod was badly terrified. “This senior clearly isn’t
using much power, and his blows seem weak. But that sword just
now…why was it so bizarrely fast? I was almost unable to block in
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, frowned.
He then continued to battle against the Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he’d
launch that stab once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s stabbing
attack had far, far exceeded the mysteries that were contained in an
ordinary mastery of the Dao of the Sword. This was a sword-art that
contained some of the mysteries of the [Five Treasures] sword-art,
which itself had exceeded the Heavenly Daos. Even when using
Zifu-level strength, the power of the stab was enough to cause the
Primal-level Fiendgod to feel uneasy and nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SLASH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, a terrifyingly
fast sword managed to lash out with enough speed that it stabbed
straight through the forehead of the Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifyingly fast
speed brought a shocking penetrative power with it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That’s the
feeling!” Ning revealed a hint of a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior!” The
Primal-level Fiendgod was completely stupefied. “This junior admits
to being vastly inferior. Senior, your sword-arts are simply
inconceivable. This junior has never even heard of such powerful
sword-arts before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Poor Fiendgod. He was
repeatedly lacerated and stabbed over and over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-stance…of
the five stances, it looks the simplest, but it is the fastest and
most direct sword-stance. It is the second stance to take form.”
Ning nodded. “This sword-stance…let me be known as ‘Blood
Drop’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop
stance…the fastest, most savage, most penetrating sword-stance of
the five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-sixth year
of Ning training in the sword. Within a minor world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go! Go! Go!” A
violet-robed maiden was controlling a pair of azure and violet flying
swords from afar, sending them streaking towards Ning as streaks of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had two swords in
each hand. These two swords were both shockingly heavy. When Ning
wielded it, he felt as though he was striking out with a hammer or a
mace. When his two swords collided against the flying swords, two
deep booming sounds could be heard as he smashed the flying swords
back, knocking them far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!
This senior clearly isn’t that strong; his power is merely at the
Zifu-level. I’m a Primal Daoist. How could he have smashed back my
flying swords with raw force?” The violet-robed maiden was
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This third sword has
finally taken form as well.” Ning revealed a smile. “This
sword-stance shall be the ‘Heavenbreaker’ stance of my five
stances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All magic treasures
could change in weight. Even the most ordinary of Mortal-ranked or
Earth-ranked treasures could, through the usage of certain seals,
transform to weight ten thousand kilograms or become as light as a
feather. As for Protocosmic spirit-treasures like the Goldstar Beads
of the Heavens…they could be as heavy as a small star or as light
as a bubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, not even Ji
Ning would be able to control the 3600 beads if he made all of them
weigh as much as a small star. Thus, a weight that was a good fit
would be the ‘best’ weight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenbreaker
stance involved changing the sword to make it heavier, then using
that weight to strike! If a sword was ridiculously heavy, it would
become very slow…but if a sword was too light, there would be
limits on how fast it could be. To reach the fastest speed possible,
one had to find the perfect weight for a particular cultivator, based
on his or her actual strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenbreaker
stance was very fast, but it also contained tremendous force. It was
capable of splitting apart Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-third year of
Ning training in the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Countless divine needles, more than ten thousand in total, had
completely surrounded Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was holding those
two twin swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of
sword-light lit up. Instantly, two vortexes of water that were
spinning in completely opposite directions appeared in midair. When
the ten thousand-plus needles struck, they were completely blocked by
these two curtains of water that were spinning in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stance shall be
called Yin-Yang.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yin-Yang stance…a
defensive sword-stance to be used when faced with countless
simultaneous attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifty-first year of
Ning training in the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…What’s up with
this senior? His strength and speed are both quite low, merely at the
Zifu-level, but he’s able to simultaneously fight with us thirteen
brothers at the same time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he’s quite
formidable. In close combat or in ranged combat, we are completely
unable to harm him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirteen Primal
Diremonsters had joined forces against Ning, each of them Fiendgod
Body Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still held those
two swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Occasionally, the
swords would transform into black holes; at other times, they would
transform into vortexes of water that surrounded him. All attacks
were blocked, and at the same time he continued to battle against the
three Primal-level Diremonsters closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This attack went on for
a full day and two full nights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still not quite
there yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, that’s not
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
he was close to the critical component, and so he hadn’t stopped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three strange
sword-flashes suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of the nearby
Diremonsters had their heads severed apart. Although those heads
quickly flew back and reconnected to their bodies, the thirteen
Diremonsters were completely stunned. They had surrounded and
attacked this man, but he was still able to sever the heads of three
of them, all Primal-level Diremonsters?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm. Finally. That’s
more like it.” Ning grinned. “This sword-stance…let it be known
as Shadowless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shadowless stance…the
strangest stance, and a very fast one. Its speed was second only to
the Blood Drop stance, and it completely surpassed the speed of the
other three. The Blood Drop stance, by comparison, was honorable and
open, whereas this Shadowless stance was strange and unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wooden boat was
drifting about within a river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated within
the boat, meditating. His old bald servant, Empyrean God Ninefangs,
was quietly standing guard next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been training
for fifty-one years with the sword. I used the [Five Treasures] as
the foundation, coming up with five stances of my own, based on my
insights into the Dao of the Sword. Finally, these five stances have
all taken form.” Ning felt a joyful feeling in his heart. Years
ago, a vast, broad world of the sword had opened up before him. Only
today had he finally managed to truly separate that world into five
major parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sword-arts could be
divided up as belonging to one of his five stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Five Treasures]
sword-art had been infused by Ning into these five stances as well.
As a result, all five of these sword-stances were incredibly fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five
sword-stances of the [Brightmoon] sword-art…Soleheart, Yin-Yang,
Blood Drop, Heavenbreaker, Shadowless.” Ning had a feeling that any
of the five sword-stances, when trained to the utmost limit, would
far surpass all other types of sword-art that existed in the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, that
would only happen if he was able to continuously improve upon them
and perfect them. They were nothing more than rough outlines, right
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.” A
spatial vortex suddenly appeared within the wooden boat, with
Patriarch Subhuti emerging from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly rose to
his feet. “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
Empyrean God Ninefangs was shocked as well, and he immediately bowed
with respect.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You succeeded?”
Subhuti sat down in the lotus position, facing Ji Ning. “Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position as well. Nodding, he said, “Still, it’s just an
outline for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the name of
this sword-art?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Brightmoon]
sword-art,” Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded. “The
sword-art you created isn’t bad. It has a certain quality about it,
as though a school can be founded around it. Although its still quite
new and young, its future potential is limitless. Haha…the method
you used to come up with this sword-art was quite amusing. You
actually suppressed your own power to go spar against Zifu Disciples,
Wanxiang Adepts, and Primal Daoists…and you actually succeeded in
developing a set of sword-arts. Before you, all we would ever see was
major powers of the Three Realms occasionally providing some guidance
to young cultivators through sparring. There has never been anyone
who actually sparred against them in earnest and thus developed a
peerless sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a bit
embarrassed,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought about it
carefully, actually. Weak cultivators do indeed have slow, weak
swords. When you suppressed yourself to make yourself even weaker to
spar with them, you were forced to constantly ponder ways to improve
your sword-arts, given the disparity in strength and speed.”
Subhuti nodded. “However…in the end, you won’t be able to
accomplish great things solely by sparring against weaklings. Your
future opponents won’t be as weak as them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Your
disciple understands. I only competed against them for the sake of
creating a rough outline for my sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When two experts
competed, it was easier for both sides to see what their strengths
and weaknesses were. Ning had discarded swordforce, heartforce,
Immortal energy, and all other sources of power in his quest to find
a sword-art that belonged to him. Now that the rough outlines of the
sword-art had taken shape, in the future he would compete against
true experts. That would be how he would perfect his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I have to say,
you were quite patient.” Subhuti nodded. “Mm. It’s good that
you understand this principle. Now, I’ve come here today because of
Fuxi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt a
surge of joy. Fuxi? When he had offered up those seven mighty
techniques, Fuxi had promised to create a special formation just for
him. However, he had said that it would be done within ten years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve been
meditating on the sword all this time, and so I didn’t wish to
disturb you.” Subhuti pulled out a bamboo scroll. “This was
created just for you. It’s a formation that is very suited to you.
Study it carefully.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
reverently accepted the scroll, then sent his coresense into it. All
the information regarding the formation was rapidly transmitted into
his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a formation
that was far more complicated and profound than the Heaven Punisher
Formation. It was based on some of the mysteries behind the divine
body of the deceased alien invader, Rahu. When executed, the
formation would allow for the creation of a Rahu-body! And so, this
formation was known as the Rahu Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu Formation had
a total of three levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level allowed
one to command 6000 Celestial Immortals and 360,000 Loose Immortals.
This level alone was already comparable to the perfect Heaven
Punisher; the wielder would have just barely reached the Daofather
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level
allowed one to command 30,000 Celestial Immortals and 2.1 million
Loose Immortals. At this level, the Rahu’s strength and divine body
would be comparable to that of an actual True God or Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third level allowed
one to command 90,000 Celestial Immortals and 8 million Loose
Immortals. At this level, the Rahu would actually be a bit stronger
than most True Gods and Daofathers. But of course, Ning himself had a
lower level of insight into the Dao than True Gods and Daofathers
had. Thus, if Ning was in command, the strengths of the formation
would counteract Ning’s weaknesses in the Dao…and in turn, that
meant that Ning would be able to battle against actual True Gods and
Daofathers without being at any disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, that was
only if he could command and control the power of 90,000 Celestial
Immortals and 8 million Loose Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was incredibly
difficult, a hundred times more difficult than controlling the
perfect Heaven Punisher! Even amongst True Gods and Daofathers, there
weren’t many who could succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Loose
Immortals and Celestial Immortals…” Ning was rather dazed.
“I-I…how am I supposed to command so many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it slow,”
Subhuti advised. “Oh, right. At present, you don’t even have that
many Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals under your command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As Fuxi developed
this formation for you, he also arranged for an Immortal army to be
placed under your command,” Subhuti said. “You can head to the
Humanworld of Yu the Great and go speak with Daofather Hasbear. Fuxi
has already notified Daofather Hasbear; if you go see him, you will
be given an Immortal army of 90,000 Celestial Immortals and 8 million
Loose Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaa?!” Ning was
shocked and delighted. Fuxi’s gifts truly were extraordinary…but
it made sense. Even Daofather Crimsonbright had nearly 1 million
Celestial Immortals and countless Loose Immortals under his command,
and he was considered one of the weaker Daofathers. The likes of the
Five Monarchs had far, far more soldiers under their command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Humanworld
of Yu the Great…that was the central headquarters of the Primordial
Imperial Clan! Yu the Great was also known as Xia Yu; he was the
founder and ancestor of the Xia clan, also known as the imperial clan
of the human race! His world was thus the place where the Primordial
Imperial Clan was based in. This world, the Humanworld of Yu the
Great, was essentially an enormous military base for the Primordial
Imperial Clan, and so it possessed tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the Primordial
Imperial Clan, Fuxi giving Ning an army of this size was like him
giving away a single strand of hair from a yoke of nine oxen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…you still
wish to act against the Seamless Gate, yes?” Subhuti looked at
Ning. “Why haven’t you done anything for so long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I ambushed
them last time, the Seamless Gate became incredibly careful. While I
was roaming the Three Realms, they kept a continuous watch on me
through coresense. Even if I did try to ambush them again, it would
be hard for me to succeed,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course Ning wanted
to attack them again! In truth, he felt very impatient…but he knew
that being impatient would do him no good. If he made a single
misstep, he would pay a calamitous price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Subhuti
nodded. “It seems you are still cool-headed. Good. Take it slow. To
force the Seamless Gate to bow its head before you won’t be an easy
task. Work hard on your sword-arts, especially the [Five Treasures]
sword-art. If you can completely master the entire [Five Treasures],
then you’ll be able to receive Fuju’s legacy. Fuju was always a
secretive, mysterious man. I have no idea what he left behind. Both
our side and the Seamless Gate has tried to find out, but we weren’t
able to reach it at all. It seems that the only method really is for
a Fiendgod Body Refiner to master the [Five Treasures] sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He, too,
was curious as to what Daofather Fuju had left behind. Daofather
Fuju’s death made no sense, after all…and it was as though he had
actually arranged for everything to be taken care of perfectly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later, Subhuti
left. As for Ning, he first had Empyrean God Ninefangs return to the
Starseizer world, then travelled by himself to the main headquarters
of the Primordial Imperial Clan…the Humanworld of Yu the Great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Seated upon his
Voidboat, Ning traversed through the void, heading towards the
Humanworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning wouldn’t
even be able to teleport if it wasn’t for the Voidboat. This was
because he had already completely forgotten everything he had learned
regarding the Grand Dao of Qiankun, due to the effects of training in
the [Five Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an imposing
aura it has.” Standing atop his Voidboat, Ning stared at the
distant, vast world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as the eye could
see, there were interconnected cities that were spread out throughout
the world. Some of the cities were even levitating in midair! All of
the cities were drawing in enormous amounts of natural energy, so
much so that one could see with the naked eye a vortex of energy
swirling around each city. Clearly, the number of Immortals within
those cities was simply massive, resulting in a storm of energy that
testified as to the stupendous level of consumption of natural enegy
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the Primordial
Era ended, the Primordial Imperial Clan moved to this place. Now that
the storm has arrived, this has become an enormous military camp.”
Ning sighed with emotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it’s fellow
Daoist Darknorth.” A distant figure suddenly appeared via
teleportation, then flew towards Ning’s direction. It was a
muscular, fur-clad man who had a bare chest. This particular expert
of the Primordial Imperial Clan had gotten used to dressed in animal
furs when he was young, and so even after he became a divinity, he
continued to dress in this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God Fuqu,”
Ning called out to him. This was the headquarters of the Primordial
Imperial Clan; he didn’t dare act rashly here. After appearing
here, Ning had been waiting for someone to welcome him. Whenever
anyone entered this world, the Primordial Imperial Clan would
immediately know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
received Daofather Hasbear’s command. Fellow Daoist Darknorth,
come. Let’s go meet Daofather Hasbear,” Empyrean God Fuqu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Hasbear…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had quite a high
level of status amongst the human race. Although he rarely engaged in
battle, he was one of the truly ancient figures of the Primordial
Imperial Clan. When Mother Nuwa had created the human race, Daofather
Hasbear was one of the first humans who she had personally created.
He had been born in an area which had wild bears, and so he was given
the name ‘Hasbear’. In that era, the human race had been
incredibly weak and primitive, and so they had chosen names for
themselves in a very casual manner. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, Daofather
Hasbear was an ordinary mortal, but he still founded a small tribe of
his own, the Hasbear tribe. In fact, an incredible figure actually
ended up emerging from Daofather Hasbear’s tribe…Huangdi the
Yellow Emperor, one of the Five Monarchs of the human race. The
Yellow Emperor came from the Hasbear tribe, and after his rose to
prominence, he actually unified the human race for a time. Hasbear
thus supported the Yellow Emperor, allowing him to stabilize the
world. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. A wild wind
howled, and the distant army banners fluttered in the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were citadels
scattered everywhere, each of which had armies of Immortals and
Fiendgods stationed within them. Some of these armies had existed
since the Primordial Era, while some had recently been moved here
from other major worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Humanworld of Yu
the Great didn’t just have many Immortal and Fiendgod soldiers; it
also more than twenty True Gods and Daofathers who were permanently
stationed here, with Daofather Hasbear being one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Daofather
Hasbear’s territory. These armies are all under Daofather Hasbear’s
command,” Fuqu said with a chuckle. “Daofather Hasbear himself is
located inside the largest city over there.”

Chapter 43 - Years Of Seclusion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guided by Empyrean God
Fuqu, Ji Ning was led before an ancient figure of the human race,
Daofather Hasbear. Although Daofather Hasbear was as old as Suiren
and also had very high status, he was even more low-key than Suiren.
There were many stories in the Three Realms of the power of the Five
Monarchs, but there were many Celestial Immortals who had never even
heard of Daofather Hasbear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, Ji Ning
has arrived,” Fuqu said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning pays his
respects to you, Daofather,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were within an
enormous, plainly adorned palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A muscular old man was
seated on a prayer mat in the lotus position, dressed in simple
animal furs. His beard and hair looked as hard and tough as iron, and
he had the face of someone with an explosive temper. When he opened
his eyes, however, a look of eternity could be seen within them. In
fact, the ancient aura that emanated from him caused Ning to
unconsciously calm down and feel peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daofather Hasbear
looked towards Ning, a loving look slowly but naturally took form
with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Daofather
Hasbear smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had created
the human race. Hasbear was one of the first humans to be created,
and he had watched as the human race had struggled, survived, and
thrived. In his heart, he naturally felt very loving and protective
towards every single dazzling human descendant he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was
Ning’s first time meeting Daofather Hasbear, he couldn’t help but
feel a natural veneration towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi has already
spoken to me. This is a minor matter, and I’ve already made the
arrangements.” Daofather Hasbear smiled as he looked at Ning. “It’s
rare for our human race to produce someone so talented in heartforce.
You were able to reach the fourth stage of heartforce despite having
trained for less than a century; I want you to make sure you make
something of yourself. Before the Endwar comes, I want you to make a
breakthrough to the fifth stage. Let the myriad races of the Three
Realms know that our human race is capable of giving birth to a
heartforce expert of the fifth stage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shall do my
utmost,” Ning couldn’t help but say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. That’s the
attitude I like to see. Defeat isn’t frightening; what’s
frightening is not even having the courage to try.” Daofather
Hasbear smiled and nodded. “Seize every moment to train. If you can
become a True God or Daofather before the Endwar comes, our side will
be all the stronger for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning didn’t
speak any modest words at all. In his heart, he truly desired to
become a True God and a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had
far, far too many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the primordial chaos had given birth to ten great Elder Gods,
eighty-one mighty True Gods, and 108,000 Empyrean Gods! 108,000!
Although many died during the countless wars of the Primordial Era,
as well as in the war which destroyed Pangu’s Chaosworld, many
others eventually trained to reach the Empyrean God and True Immortal
level. The Seamless Alliance itself also had many Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals within their ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, there were
currently many at this level of power in the Three Realms. The
addition of Ning, by himself, had almost no affect on the overall
balance of power as a whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of a
massive army, a single person’s power wasn’t even worth talking
about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when one became a
True God or a Daofather would one have the ability to have an impact
on the Endwar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A short,
muscular man with a greataxe on his back walked into the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Luozou,” Daofather
Hasbear said, “Give it to Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, muscular man
looked towards Ning, then produced a palm-sized city within his
hands. He handed the miniature city towards Ning, then said,
“Darknorth, I heard that you are skilled in commanding soldiers in
a formation. Don’t let these Immortals down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Empyrean God Luozou,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, when the human race was still young and primitive, its
cultivation methods were imperfect and flawed. They learned many of
their techniques from Fiendgods, which was why many humans from the
earliest days of the Primordial Era trained as Fiendgod Body
Refiners. Later on, after Ki Refining techniques became better, more
Celestial Immortals and True Immortals began to slowly appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Daofather
Hasbear looked towards Ning, a look of eagerness in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning bowed
respectfully, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The city had a total of
100,000 Celestial Immortals and 10 million Loose Immortals inside of
it! Ning sent all of these Immortals into his own Starseizer world
and made arrangements for them, then transmitted the basic components
of the Rahu Formation to them. Most likely, the Celestial Immortals
and Loose Immortals would only need half a year to master it, at
which point they would be able to set up the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five towering peaks
pierced high into the clouds as always. Ning was floating atop a
cloud, standing in front of the stone walls of the third mountain
peak and reading the third chapter of the [Five Treasures] sword-art.
During his previous fifty-one years of cultivation, Ning’s
swordforce had reached and surpassed the third level, and he had also
long ago mastered the complete second chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when he had
gone to meet Daofather Hasbear, he had done so with a sense of
pressure weighing down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to win the
Endwar. We can’t lose. If we lose, the entire Nuwa Alliance will be
annihilated, as will the entire human race.” Ning didn’t even
dare think about what would happen if they lost. Discarding those
thoughts for now, he turned to carefully read through the third
chapter of the [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Five Treasures]
sword-art was extraordinarily profound. This third chapter…it
caused Ning to sigh in amazement. In fact, he couldn’t help but
unconsciously begin to include some of the essence of the third
chapter into his own [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast world of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking, seated
atop his towering throne, gently strummed the fingers of his left
hand against the armrest. Tap. Tap. Tap. The tapping sounds echoed
throughout the entire dark world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that Ji Ning would end up making a play like this. He actually gave
up alien Outsider techniques to Fuxi, who developed a formation just
for him and gave him 100,000 Celestial Immortals and 10 million Loose
Immortals.” The Godking pondered silently to himself. “What sort
of techniques did he hand over? And what sort of a formation did Fuxi
give him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their
intelligence methods were formidable, there was no way it could be
detailed to such a level. They weren’t even able to find out the
details of the formation Fuxi had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And it seems Ji Ning
has finished developing his own sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm…Swordfather
Darklight evaluates it as being extraordinary. Third-stage
swordforce? This kid, Ji Ning…through sparring with those puny
little cultivators, he actually ended up reaching the third stage of
swordforce. Sheesh…” The Godking shook his head. He himself
didn’t know much regarding the Dao of the Sword. Swordfather
Darklight, however, was a terrifyingly powerful member of the
Seamless Alliance who, in the Seamless Chaosworld, had been their
number one expert in the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Seamless
Chaosworld and the Pangu Chaosworld were both destroyed, resulting in
the birth of the Three Realms…and by then, everyone acknowledged
that he was a bit inferior to Daofather Fuju!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew that Ji Ning
was formidable in heartforce, but he’s actually this impressive in
swordforce as well? Still, he’s merely at the third stage; that’s
nothing.” The Godking shook his head. “Not much of a threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the Godking
cast Ji Ning to the back of his mind, turning his attention to other
matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was responsible for
the entire Seamless Gate, and compared to his many other concerns, Ji
Ning truly was a minor figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone stele. The
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prisonworld held
two of Ning’s bodies. One was dealing with a True God, while the
other was dealing with the female True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ji Ning
opened his eyes, ceasing his meditations on his sword-art. He looked
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bottle, gourd,
bracelet, and other magic treasures around him continued to unleash
torrents of fire, water, and wind against the foe below. The enemy’s
magic treasure was shuddering, and its defensive force was beginning
to weaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty-six years.
Finally, she’s unable to hold on any longer.” Ning felt a hint of
eagerness in his heart. Perhaps this female True Immortal would be
able to help him by providing him with extremely powerful techniques
or magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and
whoosh! Instantly, the fire, water, and wind all returned to their
respective treasures. Everything returned to normal. Ning definitely
didn’t want to accidentally roast the woman to death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Submit.” Ning
looked at the female True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female True
Immortal dispersed her own magic treasure as well. She gave Ning a
cold look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense how
resolute she was. He couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Why must
you be like this? You are going to be imprisoned here for countless
ages, no matter what; so what if you choose to serve me? All I need
are some of your magic treasures and some of the techniques you hold
in your memories. I won’t harm you or lower your own personal power
at all. In the future, you’ll have a chance to escape this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop dreaming.”
The female True Immortal continued to look at Ning coldly. “You
lowly, crawling insect…forget about making me, Shui Jin, submit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empress Jin?” Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had scoured
True Immortal Winterpeak’s memories, he had learned of some of the
more famous True Gods and True Immortals of the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom. The woman before him was extremely emaciated, and her
aura was unfamiliar to Ning. This was why, prior to this moment, Ning
had no idea as to who she was. She was an extremely domineering True
Immortal who was even more powerful than Winterpeak, and so she was
referred to by others as ‘Empress Jin’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empress Jin…” A
reminiscent look appeared in the female True Immortal’s eyes.
“That’s all in the past now. All in the past. Pangaea is gone.
Everything is gone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want me, Shui
Jin, to submit? Submit to someone as weak as you? Hahaha…ahahaha…”
She began to laugh loudly, laugh wildly, laugh in a dreary, desolate
way…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She suddenly vanished,
her soul dispersing. The only thing left behind was the echoes of her
desolate laughter, which reverberated in the empty world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh upon seeing this. Upon learning that she was Empress Jin,
Ning had realized right away that it was highly unlikely that she
would submit. In truth, every single top-tier True Immortal possessed
incredible pride and self-confidence. The only reason why there was
even a chance for them to submit to Ning was because their souls had
been tormented by their chaos cycles of imprisonment within this
prisonworld. Some, however, would still rather die than submit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But despite this, Ning
didn’t waver in his decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He needed to acquire
more power from this prisonworld. He wanted to survive this
tribulation, to survive the Endwar. He wanted to rescue his wife, to
ensure that his daughter Brightmoon would be able to live a long and
happy life. He wanted to ensure that his master and his other loved
ones would survive as well. Thus…Ning would only give these alien
Outsiders a single chance to survive: Submit to him! If they refused
to choose to submit, then…they could all go die!

Chapter 44 - Empyrean Gods And Celestial Immortals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the female True
Immortal known as ‘Empress Jin’ perished, Ji Ning carefully went
through the relics that she had left behind. Although his gains were
significant, he didn’t find any important techniques or chaos items
which he was in desperate need of. Clearly, prior to coming to this
prisonworld, she had exchanged items that she couldn’t use for
large amounts of spirit pills and Immortal pills. Here in this
prisonworld, those were what really mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I used six
types of treasures at the same time to unleash fire, water, and wind
against her…clearly, the power was vastly inferior to that of the
Eight Fires Qiankun World.” Ning shook his head. “I’ll let my
other clone deal with the True Gods and True Immortals. I should have
this one deal with the Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals.
Although their treasures are much less valuable, and although the
chances that they are in possession of a powerful technique are very
low, at least I can kill them or force them to submit in a much
shorter period of time. I can also use them to train and temper my
[Brightmoon] sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
comprehended 90% of the third chapter of the [Five Treasures]
sword-art. The remaining parts were becoming increasingly difficult
to understand. He would need to rely on repeated, actual battles so
as to gain the insights he needed to better understand the [Five
Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, he created
the [Brightmoon] sword-art through dueling weak Immortal cultivators.
Only by battling against experts on his level in actual,
life-and-death duels would he be able to further perfect this
sword-art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Obviously, outside the
prisonworld it would be hard for him to find so many experts on his
level to spar against. The prisonworld, however, had many.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Overseer?” A
skinny, weak-looking youth sat there, head raised as he stared at the
distant Ning. “A True Immortal…but with such a weak aura?
Strange. Logically speaking, a position as important as ‘Overseer’
should be given to core members of Pangaea. How could a core member
be a True Immortal of the weakest possible level? Can it be that the
prisonworld has fallen into enemy hands?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!” Ning let out
a loud roar, and his twin swords howled through the skies towards the
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing Ning attack
him without even speaking to him, the skinny youth was shocked…and
then a mad look appeared in his eyes. “So it really is an enemy.
You want me to die? Puny True Immortal, you go die first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny youth let
out a low growl as the muscles on his tiny frame suddenly began to
bulge out. His rune-covered skin became pure-white as he instantly
transformed from a skinny, beggar-like youth to a figure that looked
like a god of war. His body went blurry for a moment, then four
different faces appeared on him, as well as a total of eight arms,
each of which was wielding a strange, black, staff-like weapon. He
growled, then pounced towards Ning. “Outsider, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning viewed these
people as alien Outsiders. They, too, viewed Ning as an alien
Outsider!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
everywhere, as did dancing staff-shadows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked flying
backwards in their very first clash. He smashed hard against the
ground, creating a deep ditch within it. Ning’s body then blurred
momentarily before he, too, gained three heads and six arms, with a
sword in each hand. “Master’s words were wise. If I wish to truly
perfect [Brightmoon], I have to fight against more experts.” A
blazing light was in Ning’s hands as he once more charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two battled
nonstop. It seemed as though the skies would collapse and the earth
would shatter. The fight was absolutely frenetic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This prisoner had four
faces and eight arms, and his staff-techniques were extremely
profound. Imprisoned here for countless eras, the only thing he had
to do was to meditate and cultivate, resulting in his
staff-techniques become even more formidable, far more so than Ning’s
[Brightmoon] sword-art. Ning was at a complete disadvantage in their
battle. Fortunately, however, Ning was protected by the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], and so even when he was struck he wouldn’t be injured
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t use the
[Starseizing Hand] or his heartforce; the [Starseizing Hand] used up
too much divine power, while heartforce was quickly depleted in a
battle. In addition, what Ning really cared about right now was to
further perfect his sword-arts. By relying on the protection of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning was able to continue the fight, even
though he was being completely outclassed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. What the hell
type of protective ability is this? As a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he’s
clearly just an Empyrean God. How the hell is his divine body this
tough?!” The youth was beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even in the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, protective divine abilities were extremely precious.
It was incredibly difficult for someone at the Empyrean God level to
be able to train his body to become comparable to a top-grade Pure
Yang treasure. For example, the True God which Ning’s other clone
was dealing with only had a body that was on Ning’s level as well!
In truth, the only reason why Ning himself was able to completely
master the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was because of his accomplishments
in the Realmwar in the Grand Xia. Daofather Crimsonbright wished to
express his thanks, which was why he had gifted Ning with the many
Great Firmament pills Ning needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues…my
divine power continue to be depleted. Once it is all used up, I’ll
die.” The youth was both furious and frantic. “But even if I die,
I’m not going to let this alien Outsider off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsider…DIE!”
The youth’s entire body suddenly began to glow with red light.
Clearly, he had used some sort of divine ability that allowed his
power to increase by an explosive amount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning was
extremely skilled in defensive techniques, and his [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] continued to render his opponent’s attacks ineffective. He was
still able to endure the blows and continue fighting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling for
another hour, Ning had become completely familiar with this foe’s
techniques. The youth had begun to repeat them over and over, and
they were of no further use to Ning in terms of perfecting his
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shadowless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords
suddenly became blurry. Whoosh! The youth’s four-faced head was
instantly severed and sent flying into the air. The severed head’s
eyes were filled with a look of shock. He had clearly been dominating
his foe…how was it that his foe had suddenly exploded with power
that far surpassed his own? He had no idea that when Ning used both
the [Starseizing Hand] and his fourth-stage heartforce, Ning’s
power was vastly superior to his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had overpowered
Ning, he had struck Ning more than a hundred times without being able
to breach Ning’s [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had
overpowered him…a single sword had lopped his head off!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This made it obvious
how important a protective divine ability was. Alas, the
[Indestructible Body] technique which Ning had learned from the stone
stele required an incredible price to be paid for mastery. Even the
likes of Fuxi and Subhuti, upon seeing the price, had instantly
discarded the notion of training in it. This was because they hadn’t
even heard of some of the chaos materials necessary to master it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The severed
head came flying back, reattaching itself to the body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The youth
frowned in puzzlement as he stared at Ning. “Outsider, why didn’t
you kill me?” Given that Ning was able to sever his head with a
blow, Ning clearly was capable of completely crushing and destroying
his body…and yet, Ning had not, allowing his head to fly back and
reattach to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…I’ve
long heard that the Immortals and Gods of Pangaea are incredibly
formidable. My hands were a bit itchy, so I wanted to see it for
myself,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“See it for
yourself?” The youth was speechless. “Y-y-you…aren’t you
afraid of me killing you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you able to?”
Ning rebutted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was stunned.
Yes…given how formidable the man’s protective divine ability was,
it would be impossible for anyone on his same level to overpower and
kill him. The only solution would be to keep him suppressed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Even if I
suppressed you with my power…eventually, my divine power would be
used up and I would still die.” The youth shook his head. What he
didn’t know was that Ning actually had another body here. Even if
the Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals of Pangaea were powerful
enough to suppress him, the other clone could come and, by relying on
the Eight Fires Qiankun World, slowly roast to death any and every
Empyrean God or Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To roast the energy out
of a True God or True Immortal might take dozens of years, but to do
the same to an Empyrean God or Celestial Immortal would be far
quicker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly has
happened to Pangaea? And…what exactly do you want?” The youth
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the youth succumbed to Ning’s combination of threats and
blandishments, electing to serve Ning. Ning was more powerful than
him, which naturally made it so that he didn’t feel as opposed to
serving Ning as more powerful figures might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you really just
wanted to spar against me…you could’ve first recruited me, then
fought me. Both of us could’ve simply lowered the amount of energy
we used to keep things safe. Wouldn’t that be easier?” The youth
still felt a bit of resentment; that battle just now had used up an
enormous amount of his divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had first
recruited you, would you have been willing to go all-out against me?”
Ning shook his head. If the youth hadn’t had the desire to go
all-out and try to kill Ning, the battle would’ve been completely
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After recruiting the
youth, Ning searched his memories, then went to the field of
primordial chaos to replenish his divine power. The chaos region
inside the stone stele was just a few hundred meters in size, but it
was completely split apart from the prisonworld itself. This was
because this chaos region was meant for Overseers to use. Because the
chaos region had been created by the King of Pangaea, it naturally
converted the primordial chaos within it into elemental energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The previous Overseers
would occasionally wander the prisonworld, but they generally spent
most of their time in the chaos region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After replenishing his
divine power, Ning spent a bit of time pondering the [Five
Treasures], then improved his [Brightmoon] sword-art before once more
seeking out that youth for more sparring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after a full month
did Ning leave to go deal with the next Empyrean God or Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that,
Ning began a voyage through the prisonworld in which he would sweep
through all the Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals. Although the
prisonworld was vast, it actually didn’t have that many Empyrean
Gods or Celestial Immortals. There weren’t many, after all, at that
level of power who would be qualified to be locked up in a place like
this. Ning took every single battle very seriously, and after each
battle he would gain many new ideas for further perfecting his
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Brightmoon]
sword-art continued to improve, and its power grew greater and
greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
another forty-plus years had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had swept his way
through more than four hundred Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals.
It must be understood that the entire Prisonworld 17 only held a bit
more than a thousand individuals at that level of power. These four
hundred-plus Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals ‘offered’ Ning
many treasures, and he even acquired a pair of Protocosmic
spirit-treasures! As for the number of Pure Yang treasures he
acquired, the number was ridiculously high. Ning couldn’t help but
sigh at how different the Pangaea chaos-kingdom was from the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
these Pure Yang treasures would be considered quite rare and
valuable. Powerful Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would generally
all have Protocosmic spirit-treasures on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Pangaea
chaos-kingdom, however, Protocosmic spirit-treasures were very
rare…but extremely powerful Pure Yang treasures were very common.
Judging from the memories Ning had sifted through, Pangaea had far
superior methods for manufacturing and producing magic treasures,
which was why there were so many top-class Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Eight
streaks of truefire dragons continued to blaze away at the
green-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been eighty-two
years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had used the Eight
Fires Qiankun World to burn away at the green-haired man for
eighty-two years. As far as this True God was concerned, every one of
these years had been more difficult to endure than a trillion
‘ordinary’ years. His divine power continued to deplete without
any replenishment at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop it.” Finally,
the green-haired man called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s clone had been
analyzing some sword-arts. The past eighty-two years had been quite
boring; all he did was occasionally add a bit of ki into the treasure
while spending most of his energy on his sword-arts. Upon hearing the
green-haired man’s call, Ning immediately woke from his meditative
trance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
green-haired man looking towards him, Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the man intended to
commit suicide, he probably wouldn’t have called out to Ning. He
would’ve rather been burnt to death than speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since had had spoken
out…he was most likely about to submit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to him, Ning had
dealed with two True Immortals. This would be the first True God who
would submit to him. Perhaps there might be an unexpected surprise.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_45___Great_Fortune__Grea"></A>
Chapter 45 - Great Fortune! Great Fortune!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man’s
eyes were like those of a starving hawk’s as he glared at Ji Ning.
He said hoarsely, “If I submit to you…what do you wish of me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Clearly,
the man was considering submitting. However, he was also a True God;
if Ning went too far in humiliating him, he’d probably rather die
than submit. Ning explained, “I need the treasures that you have on
you. Here in this prison, your treasures are of no use to you anyhow.
You might as well give them to me. Also - I need to search your
memories…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Memories?” The
green-haired man’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To you, I’m an
alien. To me, you are an alien.” Ning smiled. “Your personal
secrets might be very important to you, but they are completely
meaningless to me. Don’t worry; I won’t tell anyone about them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guarantee,” Ning
said, “That these two requests are all I want! If you accept, you
continue living a peaceful life here. In addition, I’ll provide you
with spirit-pills to ensure that you’ll be able to continue to
survive. If you stay alive, you’ll have a chance to leave the
prisonworld in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine!” The
green-haired man said hoarsely, “I accept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was pleasantly
surprised by how forthright the man was in accepting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-haired man
shut his eyes, continuing to sit there within the formation. Ning
reached out with his right hand from outside the formation, his arm
instantly expanding to become hundreds of kilometers long. His palm
pressed down against the top of the green-haired man’s head as he
sent his soul energy forward, beginning to execute the soulscouring
technique. The green-haired man didn’t attempt to fight back at
all. If he did, there was no way Ning would be able to accomplish the
soulscouring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This True God had an
awe-inspiringly large number of memories. Countless thought-bubbles
filled his mindspace, each of which represented major memories. Some
of the bubbles were covered with complicated seals, none of which
Ning was able to see through. Empyrean Gods, Celestial Immortals,
True Gods, and True Immortals all had to swear life-oaths after
learning powerful spells and techniques. Even if they wanted to teach
them to others, they wouldn’t be able to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder he was
willing to submit…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he harbors such
tremendous enmity in his heart…and his foes are all Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals. Even if Pangaea really was destroyed, some of
those Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals must have been able to
successfully flee.” After searching through the memories, Ning
understood who this True God was and the hatred this True God
harbored.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This man wanted to
leave, to find his foes, to kill them all! Even if Pangaea was
destroyed, he would still search its ruins to find his foes. He
wouldn’t feel satisfied until he was certain they were all dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t pay too
much attention to the exact details of this feud. He discarded that
information, focusing his attention in a different direction…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning’s soul
energy entered a particularly thought-bubble, a profound technique
suddenly entered his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
The Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Ning was
seated within the thatched cottage, meditating on sword-arts. He was
suddenly startled awake as the information pertaining to that
technique entered his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Brightmoon
is causing trouble again. She saw injustice occurring and insisted on
intervening, resulting in her offending several Immortal cultivators.
After she beat them up, their elders came. She just went ‘kill,
kill, kill’ and ended up slaughtering quite a few of them. She’s
in real trouble now; the Patriarch of their clan is a Celestial
Immortal. I’m not worried about his flunkies, but if he personally
appears we’re going to be in serious trouble. Neither I nor Autumn
Leaf have undergone our tribulations!” Little Qing frantically
reported the above to the black-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? It’s fine.
Don’t worry.” The black-robed Ning nodded. “Brightmoon has a
kind heart. It’s good to let her experience more of the world.
Still…keep a close eye on her. Don’t let her embark upon the path
of evil.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Autumn Leaf and I are keeping a close watch on her.” Little Qing
nodded repeatedly. “Alright, I’m going to go back now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. She disappeared
into thin air, teleporting away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
just chuckled. After so many years, Brightmoon had become much more
mature than before. In fact, she didn’t like to roam about in her
natural childlike form, and so changed her appearance into that of a
young woman. In addition, she had been blessed with talent by her
parents. Given that Patriarch Subhuti doted on her as well, she had
long ago reached the Void-level. However, due to her extraordinary
background, it was guaranteed that her Celestial Tribulation would be
an extraordinary one. Thus, she was still building up power in
preparing for it. Ning allowed Brightmoon to roam the outside world,
only asking that she keep Little Qing and Autumn Leaf by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, there was
something which none of the three realized…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Primaltwin had
been split into eighteen clones, and one of them was hidden within an
ordinary-looking jade talisman which Brightmoon was carrying. In
reality, this jade talisman was a Pure Yang treasure, one which Ning
had gone to Mount Innerheart to ask his senior apprentice-brother
Lord Jiang to forge. Lord Jiang had set up seals atop this jade
talisman, making it look like an ordinary item that was completely
unremarkable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After binding the jade
talisman to himself, Ning had gifted it to his daughter. It was very
rare for Ning to give her gifts, and so Brightmoon loved this one and
carried it with her at all times. What she didn’t realize was that
this ‘ordinary’ jade talisman was actually a Pure Yang treasure
which contained a pocket dimension inside it. Within that pocket
dimension was a clone of Ji Ning which primarily focused on
meditating and training in sword-arts while being prepared to protect
his daughter at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning didn’t
want his daughter to know that he was with her. Once she knew, this
adventure would no longer be much of a ‘tempering’ for her, and
she would probably be angry with him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon is
really…sheesh.” Whenever he thought of his daughter, he couldn’t
help but smile…but then the look on his face froze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A profound technique
had suddenly filled his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen clones of his
true body. Eighteen clones of his Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single clone
learned this technique at the same instant…and all of them were
stunned. Ning had spent more than ninety years sweeping through the
prisonworld, dealing with more than eight hundred Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals, as well as three True Gods and True Immortals.
Upon soulscouring this True God…finally, Ning gained something of
true value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After completely
learning and memorizing the entire technique, Ning suppressed his
excitement and continued to search through the rest of the True God’s
memories. Only after finishing his search did he stop the
soulscouring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of delight and
joy was in Ning’s eyes. His body was actually quivering slightly,
and he murmured to himself, “Great fortune…a great fortune…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens are
helping me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens are
helping me!!!” Ning’s eyes were filled with blazing excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had always
believed the Pangaea chaos-kingdom to be even more formidable than
the Three Realms, which meant that it had to have some truly powerful
divine abilities and spells. The Three Realms had the [Starseizing
Hand], the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], and other techniques. Logically
speaking, Pangaea should have techniques which were even more
powerful. And it was true; Pangaea did indeed have formidable divine
abilities at its disposal, but the ones which Ning had discovered
thus far had all been sealed away with life-oaths, preventing him
from ‘reading’ them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, however,
Ning had finally acquired a technique…and it was a technique which
he deeply desired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] evasion technique,” Ning murmured softly to
himself. “Within the primordial chaos, there are seas of lightning,
and within those lightning seas there are spirit-snakes with nine
horns on their heads…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can train in
this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can absolutely
train in this. This is something that can be used in the Three
Realms.” Ning hadn’t expected that he would encounter such a
tremendous stroke of fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
evasion techniques were extremely important. The more formidable an
evasion technique, the faster one would be able to move. The most
famous techniques in the Three Realms included the [Somersault Cloud]
of his senior apprentice-brother, Sun Wukong, as well as the [Wings
of the Garuda] of the great golden-winged Roc. These were some of the
most supreme evasion techniques of the Three Realms. When one reached
the apex of the [Somersault Coud] or [Wings of the Garuda], one would
be able to move three hundred thousand kilometers in a single
instant! This was a level of speed which even many True Gods and
Daofathers found difficult to reach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, knew the
truth…that the truly supreme, number one evasion technique of the
Three Realms was a legendary technique known as the [Golden
Sunstreak]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most supreme of
stars, the Solar Star, would give birth to a type of Godbeast known
as the Golden Crow! Only Golden Crows which were completely born from
the energy of the Solar Star were considered true, perfect Golden
Crows. As for lesser Golden Crows that had mixed heritage or which
were born after true Golden Crows copulated with other living
creatures, there was no way their bloodlined could ever reach the
level of perfect purity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, the Solar Star had once given birth to ten Golden Crows at the
same time. These ten Golden Crows all possessed incredible power. By
relying on their innate divine abilities, they were able to roam the
Primordial World without fear. One of them actually reached the True
God level, and was given the respectful title of ‘Emperor of
Monsters’. The ten Golden Crows all radiated infinite amounts of
blazing heat. They were like ten suns that baked the Primordial
World, causing the entire world endless amounts of anguish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, all ten of
them had an incredibly powerful evasion technique…the [Golden
Sunstreak]! The power of a True God, combined with the [Golden
Sunstreak] divine ability…not even Mother Nuwa and the other Elder
Gods had been able to catch them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…Houyi had
acted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was just as
terrifyingly talented as the Golden Crows, and he possessed a level
of power that was enough to stun and shake the Primordial Era. His
arrows were the fastest in the world, and they possessed enough power
to cause even major powers to feel fear. Of course…not even Houyi
was certain that he would be strong enough to slay the Golden Crow
that had been titled the ‘Emperor of Monsters’. Thus, Houyi had
spent quite a long period of time producing ten arrows of incredible
power…and then, Houyi had struck! It was as though spacetime was
completely incapable of impeding his arrows. Even the ‘Emperor of
Monsters’ had been unable to escape and had perished to his first
arrow. As for the remaining nine? Although they were ridiculously
fast, there was no way they could escape Houyi’s arrows. Houyi slew
eight of them. In the end, Mother Nuwa interceded, resulting in the
last one being spared. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the fact that
they died didn’t mean that the [Golden Sunstreak] was a weak divine
ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Sunstreak],
in truth, simply converted the user into a streak of light! Its speed
was the speed of light itself! Once one merged one’s body into the
[Golden Sunstreak], the body would go wherever that streak of light
went. As for the speed of this technique…it allowed the user to
travel three hundred thousand kilometers in an instant! This was the
absolute limit in terms of raw speed. Not even major powers were able
to surpass the speed of the [Golden Sunstreak]. Their only options
were to use their control over spacetime or certain treasures and
spells to slow down the Golden Crows, causing them to fly slower;
only then would they be able to catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them, however,
were capable of catching up to the Golden Crow that had reached the
True God level. Not even Houyi! Houyi had to produce special arrows
of terrifying power in order to catch them and kill them with his
shots.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Golden Sunstreak]…the
speed of light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was definitely a
technique that allowed one to move faster than any other living
creature of the Three Realms. Ning’s third apprentice-brother was a
Golden Crow that had been birthed from the Solar Star during the era
of the Three Realms, and he was a master of this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many majors powers
deeply desired to train in it, but…only Golden Crows that were born
from the Solar Star could do so!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent]?” Ning was incredibly excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique was an
evasive divine ability that was on the same level as the [Golden
Sunstreak].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Sunstreak]
involved a streak of blazing light that only Golden Crows could
control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent], in turn, involved a bolt of living lightning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was incredibly
difficult to train in, and in fact it could be said that cultivators
had a 90% chance of dying when attempting to train in it. Upon
mastering it, however, one would be able to enter the lightning
serpent and move far away in a single lightning bolt. The speed of
this lightning bolt was just as fast as the speed of light; both had
reached the utter limit of speed possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was to master
this technique, I’d be able to roam the Three Realms and attack the
Seamless Gate’s bases as I pleased. They wouldn’t be able to
catch me!” Ning knew that this evasion technique was extremely
difficult to train in, but he instantly decided that he was going to
master it, no matter the cost!

Chapter 46 - [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a period of
excitement, Ji Ning began to ponder as to how he should train in this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] evasion technique was definitely a first-class technique
even in the Pangaea chaos-kingdom. It had already reached the utmost
apex of speed. An incredible technique like this…the price one
would have to pay to get even a basic level of skill in it would be
similarly shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first requirement,
for example, was to transform the divine body, making it so that the
lightning serpent could swim about within it without harming it at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This, however, was
incredibly difficult…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Sunstreak],
for example, consisted of Golden Solarfire that had gained sentience.
Golden Solarfire was a type of fire that surpassed the nine mighty
types of truefire; not even True Gods or Daofathers would dare to use
their bodies to take it head-on. Even if they tried to use spells or
artifacts to block it, they might still be roasted to death! The
Golden Crow, however, was born within the deepest depths of the Solar
Star. Ordinary mortals would drown when they fell into the sea, but
fish would swim within it with ease. In a similar manner, Golden
Crows would be able to bathe in Golden Solarfire as though they were
at home. They were naturally gifted with the ability to be completely
unharmed by it, which is why they were able to master the [Golden
Sunstreak] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild and untamable
Ninehorn Lightning Serpents held the same level of power as Golden
Solarfire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Ning had
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting him, he would still be
instantly reduced to dust by the power of the lightning serpent!
Thus, he had to first transform his divine body…but the
transformation process was the most dangerous part of training in
this technique, with a 90% chance of death. If he made just the
slightest mistake, his divine body would be reduced by the lightning
serpent into ash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second requirement…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the lightning
serpent became able to roam within the divine body without harming
it, the cultivator could begin to nourish and create the divine
tattoo of a ‘lightning serpent egg’. This would give the
lightning serpent a ‘home’, as it would be able to coil up within
that ‘egg’. In addition, the divine tattoo of the egg would
slowly transform the lightning serpent, making it evolve and change
in a qualitative manner. It would be as though the lightning serpent
was a blade that had been put in a scabbard, no longer capable of
causing any damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise…given how
wild and violent these lightning serpents were, there would be no way
to control them at all. The lightning serpent had to be tamed and
rendered harmless. Only then would it be docile, at which point it
could be used to execute the evasion technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true of
the [Golden Sunstreak] technique which the Golden Crows used. After
being tamed by the Golden Crow, the streak of sentient sunlight would
no longer have its inherent, terrifying offensive power. It would
become very docile and gentle, under the complete control of the
Golden Crow. It would allow the Golden Crow to go wherever it wanted
to go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, taming
and transforming something like the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent was an
incredibly dangerous process. This was because during the taming and
transforming process, the lightning serpent would be incredibly
violent. An external source of power would be needed to help subdue
it, and within the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique
there was a record of methods involving ‘Myriad Thunders Godgems’,
‘Thousandrot Godfruits’, or ‘chaos nectar’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousandrot
Godtrees…when they reached the end of their lifespan, they would
begin to rot away and decay, but after they completely rotted away a
brand new sapling would emerge from within and begin to grow. This
new tree would become even taller and greater than the previous one,
but eventually it too would begin to rot away…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each rotting would lead
to the next tree growing ever larger and filled with ever more
vitality and energy. Finally, after a thousand rottings and rebirths,
the godtree would reach the maximum limit of power, at which point in
time it would bear fruit. This sort of fruit was known as the
‘Thousandrot Godfruit’. The total time needed for the fruit to be
created was a full chaos cycle. After ripening, it would instantly
fall down from the tree. However, as soon as it landed and touched
anything besides primordial chaos, it would instantly transform into
dust. Thus, one had to wait there in advance and prepare to catch the
godfruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the fruit ripened
and fell, the Thousandrot Godtree would once more decay and rot away,
beginning a completely new cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousandrot Godfruit
possessed incredible, unfathomable, miraculous power. In the
chaos-kingdom of Pangaea, it was something which only the three
World-level powers were permitted to possess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Myriad Thunders
Godgems, by comparison, were even rarer than Thousandrot Godfruits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the infinite
primordial chaos, seas of lightning would appear on occasion. In this
regions, large amounts of lightning would come together, resulting in
the emergence of lightning sea serpents of tremendous power; these
things were on the same level of power as Golden Solarfire. If the
lightning sea serpents gained sentience, they would grow nine horns
on their heads, at which point they would be known as Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents. Only the sentient lightning serpents with nine
horns were tamable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the sea of lightning
was vast enough, and there were enough Ninehorn Lightning Serpents
present…sometimes, Myriad Thunders Godgems would be crystallized.
Ninehorn Lightning Serpents love to swim around these godgems. Thus
if one acquired one such godgem, one would be able to easily tame a
lightning serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was infinitely vast, and seas of lightning would only be encountered
every so often. Seas of lightning that contained Myriad Thunders
Godgems were even rarer, and whenever they were discovered, the major
powers who found out would immediately think up ways to seize them
for themselves!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar was also
incredibly mysterious. One had to establish a vast world, then use it
as the foundation for a grand formation meant to extract essence from
the primordial chaos. Each chaos cycle, only six bottles of chaos
nectar could be harvested! In addition, since chaos nectar possessed
no elemental qualities of its own, it was usable in many different
ways. The primordial chaos gave birth to all things, after all! Thus,
chaos nectar could also be used to tame a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To tame a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent, one would normally need either nine Thousandrot
Godfruits, a single Myriad Thunders Godgem, or six bottles of chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Three Realms,
I’ve never even heard of this godfruit or this godgem. I do,
however, have chaos nectar.” Ning pondered to himself. “No matter
what, I’ll need a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent; first to transform my
body, then to tame it for ‘riding’. The Three Realms does,
however, have a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to pay a visit
to Exalted Celestial Thundergod,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
there was a major power who was capable of controlling Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents. He was Exalted Celestial Thundergod!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an incredibly
mighty major power who perpetually kept to himself in seclusion. Even
to this day, with the Three Realms gripped by a storm, he rarely
intervened. In truth, there were many major powers like him, who kept
to themselves in seclusion. They were all preparing quietly, waiting
for the Endwar to come before they would erupt with their full power
and slay their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
The Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated within
the thatched cottage. Rising to his feet, he called out, “Ninefangs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light flew
towards the cottage from far away, landing in front of it. It was
Ninefangs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Accompany me to the
Thundergod major world,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ninefangs
acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two entered the
Voidboat, then exited Sword Immortal world via the Void, hastening
towards the Thundergod world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, in the
distant past, before the Primordial Era had even begun, the
primordial chaos had given birth to ten mighty Elder Gods and
eighty-one True Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighty-one True
Gods were all born with mastery over a Grand Dao. One of them was
Exalted Celestial Thundergod, who was born with control over the
Grand Dao of Lightning. He naturally possessed tremendous talent in
thunder and lightning. However, although his divine body was capable
of withstanding many lightning bolts, it was unable to withstand the
power of the lightning sea serpents or the Ninehorn Lightning
Serpents of the primordial chaos. He only had a True God’s body,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God of Fire
Zhurong, for example, was able to withstand the Golden Solarfire and
Golden Sunstreaks. Alas, Elder God Zhurong did not have any methods
at his disposal for actually taming any of those streaks of fiery
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow’s
ability to do so was an innate one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast world, filled
with countless bolts of lightning that were thundering down from up
high. One could see with the naked eye a thousand lightning bolts at
any given moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat was
currently in the skies of this world. Although lightning bolts
continuously hammered against it, they were unable to damage it at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look
first.” Ning spread out his heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exalted Celestial
Thundergod is over there. Let’s go,” Ning said. Although
Thundergod possessed tremendous power and was one of the top-tier
Daofathers, his skill in heartforce was inferior to Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat flew
through the skies, quickly arriving before a levitating mountain. The
peak of this levitating mountain was surrounded by a large amount of
electricity, and there were armored soldiers guarding the peak as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who goes there!” A
Celestial Immortal soldier barked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Ji Ning. I wish
to pay my respects to Exalted Celestial Thundergod,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
group of soldiers was quite surprised. They had all naturally heard
of the famous Sword Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning. The soldier
immediately replied, “Sword Immortal Darknorth, please wait a
moment. I’ll go make a report right away.” Instantly, the soldier
quickly departed to relay the message. As for Ning and Ninefangs, a
cloud appeared beneath their feet. They stood atop the cloud and
waited patiently. This was the territory of a top-tier Daofather;
they didn’t dare to be the slightest bit discourteous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the Celestial Immortal flew back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Exalted
Celestial has instructed for you to go see him, Sword Immortal
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefangs, waited
for me here,” Ning instructed. Ning then flew by himself towards
the top of the mountain peak, where the Celestial Immortal was
waiting for him. “Sword Immortal Darknorth, please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was led
forward, he secretly sighed to himself. Generally speaking, most
major powers would beautify their residences. The Dao Palace of the
East, Mount Ling of the West, Mount Innerheart, the Celestial
Court…these were all beautiful places. Exalted Celestial
Thundergod, however, had chosen a place that was nearly pitch-black.
This levitating mountain didn’t even have a single speck of
vegetation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Exalted
Celestial is over there,” the soldier said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a look. He
saw a tall, towering figure seated in the distance. The figure had to
be at least thirty thousand meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods were born
with bodies of this size; it could be considered a ‘normal’
height.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning smiled
and nodded, then walked towards the figure. He soon arrived at the
dais before the figure, then said respectfully, “Ji Ning pays his
respects to you, Exalted Celestial Thundergod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering, muscular
figure, dressed in pitch-black armor, opened his eyes. Sparks of
lightning could be seen within them as he gazed down at the miniscule
Ning. “Ji Ning. I’ve heard of you before. Suhbuti is indeed
talented in teaching his disciples. Go ahead and speak. Why have you
come to my place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly let out a
sigh of relief. From the sound of it, this person would most likely
be willing to give Ning’s master, Patriarch Subhuti, some face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior is in
desperate need of a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent,” Ning said
respectfully. “Of the major powers of the Three Realms, only you,
Exalted Celestial Thundergod, are in possession of these lightning
serpents. This junior would like to beg you, Exalted Celestial, to
bestow one such serpent. I am willing to use Protocosmic
spirit-treasures to trade for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering Thundergod
just closed his eyes. He said in a calm voice, “Leave.
Immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod wasn’t even going to discuss this, and instead had
ordered Ning to leave immediately? What was he supposed to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exalted Celestial,
this junior is willing to use treasures to trade for it. Please
consi-…” Ning said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod opened his eyes. His gaze was like ice. “If you don’t
leave…don’t blame me for showing no mercy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment, Ning
didn’t know what to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SCRAM!” Exalted
Celestial Thundergod glared coldly towards Ning as he roared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
ashen. He immediately bowed, turned, and left.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 47 - No Other Options
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Ninefangs
was waiting outside the levitating mountain atop his cloud. Suddenly,
he saw his Manorlord, Ji Ning, appear from within the distant
mountain peaks. Ning was hurriedly walking in his direction.
Ninefangs couldn’t help but feel surprised: “Why has the
Manorlord returned so quickly from his meeting with Exalted Celestial
Thundergod?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step,
Ning moved to Ninefangs’ cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord?”
Ninefangs whispered softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave.”
Ning didn’t waste time explaining. He immediately released his
Voidboat, entered it alongside Ninefangs, then departed through the
Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Voidboat suddenly
appeared amidst the clouds of the major world known as the ‘Hu
Kingdom’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Exalted
Celestial Thundergod first saw me, he was clearly quite courteous.
But as soon as I mentioned the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent, he
immediately turned hostile.” Ning carefully pondered what had just
happened. Given that the Three Realms had been swept into a storm,
most of the major powers in their alliance were fairly friendly
towards the younger fellows. Ning had already met with figures like
Daofather Crimsonbright, Fuxi, and others. All of them were very
friendly to him. Although Exalted Celestial Thundergod was famous for
his explosive temper, he had also been quite friendly at first as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did he turn so
hostile when I mentioned the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent? I was
willing to use treasures to trade for it, but he wasn’t even
willing to consider it.” Ning frowned in thought. “What should I
do? The only major power in the Three Realms that possesses Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents is Exalted Celestial Thundergod. If I can’t
acquire one from him, then I’ll have no choice but to go to a
lightning sea if I want to train in this technique…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Capturing Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents was incredibly difficult. Not even the major
powers who were skilled in capturing creatures were generally willing
to spend the effort necessary, as the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents
were of no use to them. The only one who was willing to spend so many
years on this task was Exalted Celestial Thundergod, who had captured
quite a few of them over the countless eons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord?”
Ninefangs asked, puzzled, “Why have we come to the Hu Kingdom?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To visit True
Immortal Hu Yu, of course,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hu clan was a clan
that was subordinate to the Primordial Imperial Clan of humanity.
Although it was quite flourishing, it had never given birth to a True
God or a Daofather. After the Primordial World was destroyed and the
Three Realms were born, the Hu clan had moved here to this major
world, taking it over! Given the Hu clan’s power, conquering a
major world was very easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even back during the
Primordial Era, the Hu clan had more than eighteen Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals amongst their ranks. By now, they had more than
thirty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal Hu
Yu?” Ninefangs was puzzled. He didn’t understand why Ning wished
to meet with True Immortal Hu Yu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning spread out
his coresense to encompass the entire major world, quickly
discovering True Immortal Hu Yu’s location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a secluded
mountain valley. There were a few thatched cottages scattered
throughout the valley. A few women could be seen teasing each other,
some of them playing around within the waters of a creek.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Hu
Yu.” A voice suddenly rang out within the valley.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” One of the
women playing around within the water, a green-robed woman, unleashed
her coresense. She immediately located the white-robed youth and the
bald elder located outside the formation protecting this valley.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
green-robed woman immediately recognized him. “That bald old man by
his side should be Empyrean God Ninefangs, one of the seven Empyrean
Gods led by Empyrean God Redsnow who appeared within the Realmwar for
the Crimsonbright Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister, what is
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other women all
emerged from the creek and from their respective houses, gathering
around her. In truth, women were all Celestial Immortals who were
under the tutelage of True Immortal Hu Yu. However, True Immortal Hu
Yu disliked referring to others as ‘disciple’ or being referred
to as ‘master’, and so these women usually referred to her as
‘big sister’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No more playing
around,” True Immortal Hu Yu instructed. Instantly, the female
Celestial Immortals all fell silent, no longer daring to run around.
However, they were all curious…who was this visitor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Hu Yu
waved her hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An opening suddenly
appeared at the end of the gorge. This gorge had been covered by a
protective barrier which wasn’t easy to penetrate. From the opening
emerged two men, a white-robed youth and a bald old servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.” True Immortal Hu Yu smiled merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Hu Yu.
I’ve come with a request,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Come inside and
speak. If there’s anything I can help you with, fellow Daoist, I
definitely won’t just stand by idle.” True Immortal Hu Yu was
extremely curious. What did this famous Sword Immortal Darknorth wish
of her? She immediately guided Ning into a thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The interior of the
thatched cottage was decorated in a very refined manner. Ning and Hu
Yu both sat down facing each other, with Hu Yu pouring some Immortal
wine for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before I came to
your place, fellow Daoist, I paid a visit to your master; Exalted
Celestial Thundergod,” Ning said. “I visited him with the
intention of trading him some treasures for a Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent…but I didn’t expect that he immediately ordered me to
leave without even letting me finish my words. I was out of options,
so I came here to meet with you, fellow Daoist, in the hopes that you
might have an idea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu Yu was the disciple
which Thundergod doted on the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod was born from the primordial chaos with control over the
Grand Dao of Thunder. His temper was equally explosive as his Dao;
although there were some disciples he doted upon, there were others
he was extremely strict with. The one he doted on the most was his
one and only female disciple, True Immortal Hu Yu. This was why Ning
had come to meet with Hu Yu, in the hopes that she might have an
idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent?” Hu Yu was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…going to
be hard.” Hu Yu shook her head. “It’s true that the only person
in the Three Realms who possesses these serpents is my master…but
to Master, these serpents are incredibly important. Once, long ago,
Daoist Three Purities asked for Master to provide him with a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent for use in forging a certain magic treasure. Master
was extremely unwilling. In the end, Daoist Three Purities gave my
master multiple Chaos ingredients that he needed before my master
accepted. However, that was a long, long time ago. Now that the storm
has decided…there’s no way even Daoist Three Purities would be
able to acquire another serpent from him, to say nothing of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you know
that Master’s most important treasure is the ‘Hammer of
Punishment Thunder’?” Hu Yu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do know.” Ning
nodded. “Exalted Celestial Thundergod wields the Hammer of
Punishment Thunder, releasing lightning to punish wicked Immortals
and Fiends alike.” Ning was puzzled. “But what does that have to
do with the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where do you think
the lightning of the hammer comes from?” Hu Yu shook her head and
smiled. “Master can simply summon some of the weaker types of
lightning from the natural world, but he has to work hard to extract
the more powerful types of lightning from lightning seas in the
primordial chaos. This is especially true for the supreme type of
lightning, the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents. After extracting them, he
has to refine them before he can smelt them into his Hammer of
Punishment Thunder. This allows him to release them at a critical
moment to assault his foes, then draw them back after the attack is
finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that of the
various types of thunder, the most powerful types were the lightning
sea serpents and Ninehorn Lightning Serpents. The lightning sea
serpents were not sentient, while the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents
were. Thus, comparatively speaking the horned serpents were easier to
refine and smelt, as the mindless lightning sea serpents were
completely uncontrollable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why even the
likes of Elder God Zhurong was unable to take control over Golden
Solarfire, forcing him to devise his own ‘Zhurong Godfire’.
Suiren had similarly been unable to control Golden Solarfire, which
was why he had to devise his own Eternal Kindlefire, which was
equally powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they
couldn’t control it…was because it was simply too explosive and
wild!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden Solarfire didn’t
possess any sentience. Thus, it was too explosive and wild! Even
Fuxi, the number one formations expert of the Three Realms, was
merely able to ‘guide’ the Golden Solarfire into his formation,
and the guiding process was still extraordinarily tiresome. He had
completely mastered and fused the Heavenly Daos of both Yin and Yang,
and his skill in formations was tremendous…but that was still all
he was capable of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lightning sea serpents
were just like Golden Solarfire; they were both too wild and
untamable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninehorn Lightning
Serpents were sentient, which was why one could bind them. However,
they were extremely rare; only a tiny percentage of the already-rare
lightning sea serpents would gain sentience and transform into
Ninehorn Lightning Serpents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As far as Master is
concerned, these serpents are part of his killer weapon, his most
powerful attack. Master has spent an enormous amount of blood and
sweat binding every single serpent and infusing them into his
hammer.” Hu Yu continued, “If it wasn’t for this great
tribulation, there might be a tiny chance that Master would be
willing to give up one of them…but the tribulation has arrived, and
he might very well die in the Endwar. There’s absolutely no way he
would give up any of them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is something
that will have an impact on his chances of his survival. Given
Master’s temperament…it’s useless for anyone to try to convince
him.” Hu Yu gave Ning a look. “I’m just his disciple; there’s
nothing I can do at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “So
that’s why. I was rash and foolish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, I urge you to give up your hopes of acquiring the Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents,” Hu Yu said. “Aside from Master’s serpents,
the only way you can find them is by going to the lightning seas
within the primordial chaos. However, those lightning seas contain
many lightning sea serpents, with a small number of Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents intermingled within. Not even major powers would
dare to go too deep within. Master has the body of a thundergod, and
thus he is most likely the number one figure in the Three Realms in
terms of catching these serpents. Despite that, it took him a long
time and much work before he was able to catch a few.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded slowly. “Sorry to have troubled you, fellow Daoist Hu Yu.
I’ll leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ordered Ninefangs
to temporarily return to the Starseizer major world, then went by
himself via Voidboat into the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos mist billowed
everywhere around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he went too far and
too deep into the primordial chaos, it was entirely possible that he
would become lost. Thankfully, Ning had some maps regarding the chaos
regions around the Three Realms. Two lightning seas were marked down
on the maps, and so Ning naturally headed towards the closest one.
However…this still took him much deeper into the primordial chaos
than he went last time. Thus, he advanced very carefully, for fear of
becoming lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He advanced
continuously through the primordial chaos in his Voidboat, tearing
through space and using the various stars as his signposts. He
advanced for twelve full hours, and the amount of space he travelled
past in the Voidboat was most likely several times larger than the
Three Realms themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood up within
the Voidboat, staring into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast, endless sea…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sea of lightning and
thunder…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as he could see,
there were countless streaks of jagged white lightning that came
together to form an endless sea of electricity. The deeper one went
into the sea, the darker it became. At the deepest parts, one could
even see black flashes of lightning. These black flashes of lightning
were all shaped like giant serpents. These were the ‘lightning sea
serpents’, living lightning-beings that even major powers feared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single lightning sea
serpent was one thing, but the depths of the lightning sea held
countless black streaks of lightning within them. The lightning sea
serpents there were simply uncountably numerous. Even the mightiest
of major powers would have to go all-out in order to go deep into the
lightning sea. However, Ninehorn Lightning Serpents were incredibly
rare, with less than one in ten million lightning sea serpents giving
birth to one such sentient serpent. From this, one could tell how
difficult it was to find and catch them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no other
choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to take
the risk.” Ning stood atop the Voidboat, gazing deep into the
endless lightning sea.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_48___Deep_Within_The_Lig"></A>
Chapter 48 - Deep Within The Lightning Sea
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to enter the
lightning sea in order to train this divine ability.” Ji Ning had
no other options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had fifteen other
clones of his true body by his side, hidden within the Starseizing
Manor. One of them emerged from the manor, then flew towards the
endless sea of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a
short while, the clone reached the borders of the lightning sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Staring at
the countless flashes of white lightning before him, Ning couldn’t
help but feel his heart shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go in.”
With a boom, Ning charged forward into the endless flashing streaks
of lightning. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Countless lightning bolts
surged around him. Ning had long ago put away his magic robes,
leaving him completely nude within the sea of lightning. He allowed
the white lightning bolts to crash down upon his body repeatedly, and
almost instantly close to a thousand lightning bolts came hammering
down against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These lightning bolts
were countless times more powerful than the lightning bolts Ning had
encountered during the ninth nine-set of his Empyrean Tribulation.
Fortunately, Ning had already mastered the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and so was able to take them with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin
training in the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] and transform my divine
body.” Ning allowed his nude body to bathe in the lightning,
shutting his eyes and focusing on activating the divine ability.
Instantly, a series of divine golden tattoos began to appear on the
surface of his body. As the divine tattoos continued to appear, the
white lightning around Ning that had been attacking him seemed to
become more gentle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, Ning’s entire
body became covered in countless golden tattoos. These golden tattoos
were all linked together, and one could vaguely make out a single
massive character…the character for lightning in the script of the
Pangaea chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Once the barrier of golden tattoo-light was formed, the surrounding
white lightning all began to swirl around it. Slowly, a vortex of
lightning was formed, and at the center of this vortex was what
looked like a cocoon of lightning, with Ning located within the
cocoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the lightning
cocoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscles and skin of
Ning’s naked body were all twitching and shuddering as strands of
white lightning continuously flowed into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning’s
body had been capable of easily withstanding the white bolts of
lightning thanks to the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], which completely
blocked all the lightning. But to transform his divine body, he had
to allow the lightning to enter every single part of it. Only then
would his divine body undergo a qualitative change. Right now, his
body wasn’t truly ‘defending’ against the lightning; it was
just lowering the power of the lightning dramatically. One slip-up,
however, and the body would instantly be reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was just the
beginning. The body’s elemental composition had to be complete
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All bodies had
elemental affinities and natures. Some, for example, were born with
bodies of water, while others were born with bodies of fire.
Generally speaking, at Ning’s level, the nature of the body didn’t
really matter. For example, even Exalted Celestial Thundergod, who
was born with control over the Grand Dao of Thunder, didn’t have a
body that could allow lightning sea serpents or Ninehorn Lightning
Serpents to roam within it without causing damage. What Ning had to
do was to change his body to become a perfect lightning vessel,
capable of allowing lightning sea serpents and Ninehorn Lightning
Serpents to roam about it with impunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps in terms of
power, there was no way he could match Exalted Celestial Thundergod,
but his affinity towards lightning would become closer than even the
Thundergod’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this alone
was testament to how difficult it was to transform one’s divine
body. The major power who developed this evasion technique was
definitely an extraordinary individual. The only reason why the True
God which Ning had acquired this technique from even had access this
technique was because he had been extremely lucky when adventuring in
a dangerous area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh.” Ning could
sense his entire body being wracked by pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine body had to
be transformed in a procedural manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first step was to
use weak lightning bolts to transform it. Next, he would slowly
upgrade the power of the lightning, allowing his divine body to
become even more perfectly affiliated with lightning, until finally
it was suitable for Ninehorn Lightning Serpents to reside within!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other types of
lightning were easily encountered. Ninehorn Lightning Serpents,
however, were incredibly rare and precious. Ning had been planning to
slowly train within the Three Realms, but he was now forced to enter
the lightning seas. The power of the lightning within the lightning
seas would increase the further he went in, making it quite a
suitable place for him. However, what awaited Ning within the heart
of the lightning sea wasn’t the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents; it was
the even wilder race of mindless lightning sea serpents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the final step
of perfecting his divine body…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had planned to use
the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent to do this. The lightning sea serpents
were simply too wild; clearly, using them to transform the body would
be much more dangerous. However…since he didn’t have a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent, he had no choice but to accept the dangerous
alternative.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed on.
His divine body transformed at a very slow pace, and every so often a
small part of his body would break apart. Ning would hurriedly use
his divine power to repair the damage, then continue with his
efforts. He spent more than a month within the white cocoon of
lightning. Still completely naked, he allowed the white lightning to
roam across his body and even inside his body, suffering no damage at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue.” Ning
soon began to advance towards the deeper parts of the lightning sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the color of
the lightning began to turn darker and darker, and they began to
increase in power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt,
then once more began his cultivation. He guided the dull white
lightning bolts into his body, allowing them to transform it. He
spent merely half a year before succeeding, then once more headed
deeper into the sea…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Ning reached an
area where all the lightning was gray, he came to a halt. He began to
use the gray lightning to transform his divine body. This time, he
succeeded after just a few days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final step is
before me.” Ning stared forward. Past this region of gray lightning
was the region of black lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black lightning
serpents swam everywhere. Once they moved at full speed, they would
be moving at the speed of light, giving them extraordinary power and
savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter where Ning
looked, he could only see these lightning sea serpents; he was unable
to see any Ninehorn Lightning Serpents at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Using lightning sea
serpents to transform my body is very dangerous…” Ning stared
forward, sensing a certain pressure that made it hard for him to
breathe. His [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was completely incapable of
withstanding such terrifying lightning bolts. Even major powers would
fear them; Ning was nothing by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent, my chances would be comparatively greater.
Well…there’s nothing for it.” Ning once more activated the body
transformation technique. Once more, the golden tattoos appeared atop
his skin, quickly forming together into a cocoon of golden light,
causing the lightning around Ning to begin to swirl towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance forward, moving towards the region where the black lightning
intersected with the gray lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning sea
serpents were wild and unbridled. They were in the shape of serpents
but possessed no sentience. In truth, they were nothing more than
peculiarly-shaped bolts of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, a lightning
sea serpent at the border region brushed past Ning’s body. The
black lightning was instantly attracted towards the golden barrier
formed by the divine tattoos, resulting in a cocoon of black electric
light surrounding Ning, who immediately retreated back into the
region of gray lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
Black electricity crackled within the cocoon. Ning carefully guided a
strand of black lightning from the cocoon into his own divine body,
allowing it to invade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lightning sea serpents
and Ninehorn Lightning Serpents were both types of lightning; the
only difference was that Ninehorn Lightning Serpents were sentient.
If he was able to succeed in transforming his body via lightning sea
serpents, it would also become suitable for Ninehorn Lightning
Serpents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nude Ning’s arm
instantly blew apart…and then the cocoon of black lightning
collapsed as well. When the vestiges of black lightning brushed past
Ning’s body, it instantly collapsed and transformed into dust,
leaving nothing else behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failure.” Outside
the sea of lightning. Ning was still seated atop his Voidboat, and
his face turned pale. The pain his clone had felt as it was destroyed
filled Ning with utter agony. The lightning sea snakes were simply
too terrifying; even the portion of truesoul within the clone had
been reduced to nothing. “Damn. The lightning sea snakes are far
too wild. I just guided a tiny part of their energy into my body, but
wasn’t even able to succeed in transforming one of my arms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do it
again.” Ning once more sent a clone forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had sent
just a single clone into the lightning sea, all of his other clones
had shared in the experience. They had all begun to ponder on how to
increase his chances of succeeding in transforming his body. Although
the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique had very detailed
notes, once the time came to actually apply the technique, experience
made a tremendous difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This death had given
Ning experience in using a lightning sea serpent to transform his
body. Next time, he would avoid certain mistakes and do better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After three months…the
second clone died as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other bodies were
all pondering carefully on what to do. His true body’s clones
continued to enter the lightning sea, testing and trying new
techniques, but this was indeed the most dangerous part of training
in this divine ability. The technique’s notes didn’t exaggerate
at all; the stated 90% chance of death wasn’t just talk! This was
even more true for Ning, who was using the extremely dangerous method
of using lightning sea serpents to transform his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than four years had gone by. Ning remained within the Voidboat,
staring at the distant, vast sea of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been more
than four years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My other fifteen
clones have all died, but I still haven’t succeeded. I was just a
tiny, tiny bit off.” Ning gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body’s
clones had all died. Only one of them remained alive, and that one
would be able to slowly grow out new clones. This was a process that
allowed for the rebirth of the truesoul, the soul, and the divine
body. However, a fairly long period of time was required. To
completely recover all fifteen bodies would take countless years.
This was the reason why Youngflame Freak had felt such despair when
he lost his sixteen clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was one other
method that could be used to quickly replenish the clones; to use the
incomparably marvelous ‘chaos nectar’. Ning was able to use chaos
nectar to break through from the first level of the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] to the second level; to use it to merely rebuild his
clones was a waste of precious resources.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the great storm had
already descended…Ning simply didn’t have the time he needed to
allow his clones to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to use
chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent a full hour
travelling towards an enormous star within the primordial chaos. He
located a mountain estate, then temporarily secluded himself within
it. He then entered the Starseizing Manor, beginning his training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos nectar can be
used to train in the second level of the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].
I, however, am wasting it in replenishing my divine body…” Ning
himself felt heartache at the waste. However, this was all for the
sake of learning the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]. This was an
evasion technique that would make even major powers grow red-eyed
with envy, an absolutely first-class evasion technique that would
allow him to always have the initiative.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When those ten Golden
Crows had devastated the Primordial Era, not even Mother Nuwa had
been able to do anything about them, precisely because the [Golden
Sunstreak] was simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled out the
stopper to a black bottle. Pop! The stopper came out, and Ning
stopped worrying about the cost. Closing his eyes, he began to employ
the regenerative technique included in the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods]. Instantly, one drop of chaos nectar after another began
to fly out of the black bottle. Every single drop contained countless
bubble that were like worlds unto themselves. The bubbles would
appear and disappear in a marvelous, unending cycle of creation and
destruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly absorbed
the chaos nectar into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An illusory figure flew
out from within Ning’s body, then solidified. Instantly, a second
Ning appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As more time passed on,
additional bodies were restored and rebuilt. In the end, a total of
sixteen Ji Nings appeared within the Starseizing Manor. This was the
limit; there was no way he could regain any more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The amount of chaos
nectar needed to replenish my clones is actually the same as needed
to break through to the second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods].” Ning truly felt heartache at the cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
that I’ll fail this time as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left the cave,
then rode the Voidboat back into the primordial chaos, heading once
more towards the sea of lightning.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 49 - Success
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat once more
came to a halt at the borders of the lightning sea. Yet another clone
flew out into the countless streaks of lightning, beginning to slowly
transform its divine body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ji Ning
could’ve transformed one clone to the level of being able to
withstand the gray lightning, then halted the transformation process
and used it as the ‘base template’ for restoring his other
clones. That way, all of the recreated clones would start with enough
affinity for lightning to immediately go and try to be transformed by
using the black lightning sea serpents. That would allow for more
time to be saved. Ning, however, didn’t do this; he continued to
have every single clone go through the slow transformation process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That way, with each
attempt Ning would continue to accumulate more experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, the reason
why Ning was able to endure the gray lightning was thanks to his
divine body having trained in the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], rather than due to him being experienced in lightning.
He only succeeded due to his incredibly tough body. By testing things
out time and time again, he was accumulating experience. He would
rather spend an extra three months gaining experience than
potentially waste a tiny bit of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Atop the
Voidboat, Ning frowned. He once more sensed the agony of his soul
being destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another failure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another streak of light
flew out and entered the sea of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clones of Ning’s
original body continued to advance, each of them being felled in turn
by the lightning sea serpents. Clearly, using them to transform his
body was incredibly difficult. However, as he continued to gain
experience and perfect his technique, each time he was able to endure
the lightning sea serpents for increasingly long periods of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt tremendous
heartache as well. Every single clone represented some of his chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just need to hold
on for a while longer. Just now, if I was slightly luckier, I
might’ve succeeded.” Ning did his best to maintain complete
calmness as he continued his attempts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the region of
gray lightning, there was a cocoon of black lightning. Within the
cocoon, Ji Ning’s nude body was covered with dim flickerings of
black lightning. His skin and his muscles would occasionally be
destroyed, but they would almost instantly recover and heal. Ning’s
eyes were closed, and all of his heartforce was focused on guiding
the strands of black lightning. The power of the lightning sea
serpents was simply too terrifying; he wasn’t able to forcibly
command even the tiniest part of it, just guide it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning had
gained increasing amounts of experience in this technique, at the
cost of paying with his life over and over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Starting with his
hands, his entire body began to transform. His torso…his four
limbs…his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes suddenly
opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Black
lightning shot out from his eyes, not damaging them in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally
succeeded.” Ning willed the barrier of golden tattoo-light to
disappear. Instantly, the cocoon of black lightning collapsed as
well. The black lightning sea snake lashed out chaotically, some of
it sweeping past Ning’s body as well. However, the lightning simply
shot through Ning’s body without damaging it. Ning continued to
stand there, completely unharmed. In fact, some of the black
lightning even swirled around inside of his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally
succeeded!” Ning excitedly clenched his fists. After having been
completely stonewalled by Exalted Celestial Thundergod, his only hope
was to risk the sea of lightning. At first, he had failed multiple
times, causing him to begin to worry. What if he died dozens of times
without succeeding? Was he supposed to use up all of his chaos nectar
on this single technique?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, as his
experience increased, he was able to withstand the transformation
process of the lightning sea serpent for increasingly long period of
times. Ning felt more confident in himself upon seeing that he was
improving…and today, he had finally succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The remaining steps
will no longer be dangerous.” Ning let out a relaxed chuckle. “The
next step will be to tame a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent. I don’t
have Thousandrot Godfruits or a Myriad Thunders Godgem, but I do have
chaos nectar. Clearly, the only issue before me is actually finding
one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning headed
straight towards the field of endless black lightning in a fearless
manner. The black lightning bolts were all in the shape of serpents,
and they flew about with wild abandon with utterly heaven-wrecking
power. However…no sea wave, no matter how vast, could drown a fish.
This region of lightning sea snakes could be described as an lethally
dangerous zone for others, but it was no longer of any danger to
Ning. Still, upon actually entering the region, Ning still slowed
down his advance and advanced cautiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One lightning sea
serpent after another flashed past Ning, some brushing against him.
Ning, however, simply felt a warm, gentle feeling throughout his
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ha.” He let out a
chuckle, then flew all the way into the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to search for a
Ninehorn Lightning Serpent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew through
the region of black lightning, he continuously released his
heartforce to search the region. Heartforce was inherently formless,
and so not even the lightning sea serpents were capable of damaging
it. Given how far Ning’s coresense stretched, he was quickly able
to locate a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent located deep within the sea of
lightning. Not hesitating at all, Ning immediately flew in that
direction, boring deep into the heart of the lightning sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ning was
still able to see the primordial chaos if he raised his head. Now,
however, the only thing he could see anywhere were those flashes of
black lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a full
hour, a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent drew close to Ning’s direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect.” Ning had
long ago formed a ‘serpent egg’ of divine tattoos within his
body. So long as a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent touched his body, it
would immediately be drawn inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning did
everything he could to move closer to that Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The giant black
serpent had nine horns on its head and was incredibly agile. It was
happily swimming about within the sea of lightning, sometimes flying
fast, sometimes flying slow. What caused Ning the most despair was
that it had suddenly begun to fly towards a different direction.
Given how fast it was, Ning wasn’t even able to catch a glimpse of
it, to say nothing of catch it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. Failed.” Once
the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent began to move away from him, given how
fast its speed was, there was no way Ning could possibly catch up to
it. Thus, actually encountering and acquiring one had an element of
luck to it, especially in the encountering part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll keep going in
deeper.” Ning continued to advance into the depths of the lightning
sea. The entire lightning sea did have a coremost region. In a
lightning sea of sufficiently vast size, Myriad Thunders Godgems
would crystallize within these core regions. However, this one had
been discovered by the Three Realms long ago. Given how able the
likes of Suiren and Daoist Three Purities were, if there were any
godgems within it, they would’ve been able and willing to pay the
price necessary to enter the core regions to harvest the godgems.
Mother Nuwa in particular was completely capable of easily traversing
the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning didn’t
believe that he would encounter a Myriad Thunders Godgem within the
core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to fly
deeper and deeper into towards core…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He flew fairly slowly
within the lightning sea. Given that the lightning sea was also quite
vast, he flew for two full months. Although he encountered more than
a hundred Ninehorn Lightning Serpents, not a single one of them
touched him. One of them was so close that Ning was able to see it
with the naked eye, but alas…with a swish, it flew past Ning
without touching him. Ning frantically expanded his body to become
ten thousand kilometers in size, but was still unable to touch it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serpent was simply
too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for more
than two months, Ning finally arrived at the core region of the
lightning sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spread out his
heartsense. He was able to sense that a series of terrifyingly
powerful ripples were emanating from the core; clearly, this was the
wellspring of power for the lightning sea. There was a large number
of Ninehorn Lightning Serpents around the wellspring as well. In this
place, Ninehorn Lightning Serpents were far more common than in any
other place. This was the reason why Ning had come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As expected, there
are no Myriad Thunders Godgems here.” However, Ning only felt
excitement. “Now that I’ve finally arrived here, I can see that
there are plenty of Ninehorn Lightning Serpents here. I should be
able to touch one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, an enormous
serpentine tail brushed past Ning. It touched the divine tattoo of a
snake egg within Ning’s body…and then, the entire enormous
Ninehorn Lightning Serpent was completely drawn towards it. Its
sentience caused it to choose to burrow straight inside Ning’s
body. The titanic, massive serpent had actually completely burrowed
itself within the divine body of the human-sized Ji Ning, entering
the divine tattoo of a lightning serpent egg.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though that
divine tattoo had become its home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his coresense
to investigate the tattoo, only to see that the Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent had lazily coiled around itself within the tattoo, seemingly
asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wonder how
the person who devised this technique was able to come up with this
lightning serpent egg tattoo. Its capable of making Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents behave like ordinary little serpents that are
still asleep within the egg in such a docile manner.” Ning felt a
surge of joy in his heart. He had accomplished his task; he had
finally managed to capture a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent. However…Ning
knew very well that it was the tattoo that kept the serpent docile
and slumbering. He himself was completely unable to control it as of
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wanted to control
it, he’d have to tame it and transform it on a fundamental level.
Only then would it truly become part of his evasion technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
slowly began to fly towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending three
full months in flight, he finally flew out of the depths of the
lightning sea, past the borders, and onto the Voidboat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Starseizing
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position within the main hall. Before him were seven black
bottles. According to the records, taming a Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent should only require six bottles, but Ning was worried about
running out mid-way. Thus, he added an extra bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ouch. Still…this
divine ability will be worth it. Even the most supreme of existences
in the Three Realms would want to acquire it. To trade six bottles of
chaos nectar for it…worth it!” Ning closed his eyes, beginning to
tame the serpent in accordance with the notes recorded regarding the
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Drops of chaos nectar
began to fly out, each filled with extraordinary power. The drops
burrowed their way into Ning’s body. Under Ning’s guidance, they
flew straight towards the divine tattoo of a lightning serpent egg,
then penetrated into the body of the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent. Once
the chaos nectar entered its body, the serpent felt an incredibly
comfortable sensation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As this happened, a
golden tattoo suddenly appeared as well. Ning had manifested it, and
he sent the tattoo flying forward, imprinting it onto the serpent’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One golden tattoo after
another began to appear, landing on the serpent’s body nonstop. At
the same time, drops of chaos nectar continued to flow into the
serpent’s body. Because of the chaos nectar, the serpent felt
incredibly relaxed and comfortable. Thus, it didn’t fight back at
all. Otherwise…it would’ve been shocked and immediately fled the
lightning serpent egg, at which point Ning would only be able to
stare blankly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s chaos nectar
continued to be used up, and more and more divine golden tattoos
appeared on the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent’s body. It slowly began
to transform, becoming friendly towards Ning. In fact, Ning’s soul
could vaguely sense its presence. It was a sensation akin to sensing
his own spirit-beast. However, the sensation was still very weak as
of now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bottle of chaos
nectar after another continued to be used up…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serpent grew
increasingly gentle, and its violent, offensive power began to
disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning opened
his eyes, revealing a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense the
spiritual conection between himself and the Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent that lay coiled within the lightning serpent egg inside his
body. However, although the little serpent was sentient, its
intelligence level was too low; all it had was a vague sense that
Ning was the most important thing in the world to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really did use up
six bottles of chaos nectar.” Ning took a look and did a tally. “In
fact, a little bit of the sixth bottle is still left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood up within
the empty region outside the lightning sea. With but a thought, he
instantly caused the black lightning serpent to appear and swirl
around his body. In fact, the little serpent even used its head to
brush against Ning’s face in a very friendly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and
swish! A streak of black light flashed, and Ning suddenly appeared
far away. Then, with another flash of black light, Ning reappeared at
his original position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this divine
ability…” Ning had a look of anticipation in his eyes. “Senior
apprentice-sister, I’ll definitely force the Seamless Gate to let
you come back.” Prior to this, his chances of successfully forcing
the Seamless Gate to lower its head were quite low; all he could do
was try his best for her sake. Now, however…Ning truly felt
confident.

Chapter 50 - Stunned
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seated aboard the
Voidboat, Ji Ning shuttled through the primordial chaos, quickly
arriving at the icy star which contained the stone stele for the
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black lightning
serpent suddenly appeared, covering the Voidboat around it. In a
flash, it moved millions of kilometers to reach a desolate plain
which was covered with pristine, untouched ice. Ning put away his
Voidboat, landed atop the plain, then laughed as he looked at the
ground. “Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three streaks of light
shot out from the icy ground, then flew towards Ning. It was a trio
of divine swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, are you
going to take us into battle now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three black-robed
children appeared atop the three swords. They looked to be four or
five years of age. Each of them was very handsome, with adorable
faces that were just asking to be pinched. However, the black robes
they wore gave them a cold, severe aura…and yet, their words were
filled with excitement and liveliness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three swords were
the Darknorth swords! Ning had kept the Darknorth swords within the
prisonworld this entire time. Quite a few alien Outsiders had died by
Ning’s hand within the prisonworld, and even a first-tier True
Immortal who was equivalent to a Daofather of the Three Realms had
been slain. The amount of baleful energy generated by their deaths
was enormous. The [Armaments of Sin] technique had been applied to
the Darknorth swords, and all three of them had broken through the
apex of the Pure Yang level to become Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once top-grade Pure
Yang treasures advanced to become Protocosmic spirit-treasures, they
would immediately become high-grade Protocosmic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Darknorth
swords were now all high-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures. However,
Ning could sense that they were very close to becoming supreme
Protocosmic spirit-treasures. The amount of baleful energy generated
by the death of that female True Immortal within the prisonworld had
been truly enormous. Ning was going to deal with the Seamless Gate
again, but he didn’t have any particularly powerful swords with
him, which was why he had sent one of his incarnations to go and
bring out his three Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to be very
careful during this extremely dangerous period of time. There was no
way that he would go to the stone stele’s location without a very
good reason. It was entirely possible that one of these days, a major
power might be following him or spying on him. If he was followed
when pulling out treasures from the stone stele, resulting in the
stone stele being discovered, he would be in serious trouble! Thus,
he had already secreted his treasures in the surrounding area. That
way, even if someone followed him to this star, they wouldn’t know
about the stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…given
that Ning had fourth-level heartforce, it would be extremely,
extremely difficult to follow him without him noticing. The Seamless
Gate did have some individuals who were capable of it, but for now at
least Ning wasn’t important enough for those figures to lower
themselves to sneak after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I’m
talking you battle. Number One, Number Two, Number Three…this time,
we’re going to let the Seamless Gate get a good taste of your
power!” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Seamless Gate
imbeciles…they are so dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We definitely have
got to let them know our power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three little
fellows were all extremely excited. The process of gaining a soul via
the [Armaments of Sin] upgrade was a fairly slow one, and the
Darknorth swords hadn’t been with Ning for that long to begin with.
Sufficiently old Pure Yang treasures would be able to gain souls even
without any special techniques. Now that these three had all broken
through to become Protocosmic treasures, they all gained spirits of
their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Protocosmic
spirit-treasures could be considered living creatures. They could
exist on their own, and they could even engage in cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The big bear of the
Starseizing Manor, for example. Ning had seen it cry, which had made
him feel as though the bear was an actual, living being. And it was
true; thanks to his extreme age, the giant yellow bear had long ago
broken through and had begun to cultivate on his own. After Ning had
barged into the ‘underwater estate’ and become the heir to Daoist
Threelives, the giant yellow bear had naturally wanted to take care
of him. Prior to Ning becoming an Empyrean God, though, the giant
yellow bear refused to let him completely bind the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason
why, when Ning had taken on Subhuti as his master, Subhuti had said
that it was not yet the right time for the giant yellow bear to leave
the manor. It was because once the bear escaped the manor and lived
on his own, there would be no way for Ning to control it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, Ning had complete
control over the manor. But since they were in dangerous, stormy
times, the giant yellow bear was willing to remain as the spirit of
the treasure, accepting Ning as his continued master. If he was to
venture out alone, his chances of dying would be too high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Three
Darknorth swords in hand, Ning headed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon returning to the
Three Realms, Ning immediately used his talisman to contact his
master. He then returned to the Crescent major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Innerheart. The
Daoist monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, please take
a look.” Ning handed a furled scroll over to his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be yet
another technique?” Patriarch Subhuti chuckled upon seeing this.
Still, he accepted the scroll with a smile. He immediately sent his
coresense into the scroll…and then he fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
quietly, waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Patriarch
Subhuti couldn’t help but let out a surprised sigh. Scroll in hand,
he said, “A fine divine ability. A fine divine ability! Even I want
to train in it after reading it. Alas, the requirements of this
divine ability are extremely hard to meet. Transforming the divine
body, then taming a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent…all of this is
extremely difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Disciple, I
heard that you paid a visit to Exalted Celestial Thundergod. I was
wondering why you went to seek him out…but upon seeing this
technique, I imagine that you must’ve sought him out for the sake
of acquiring a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. To Thundergod,
those serpents are as important as his life.” Patriarch Subhuti
shook his head. “Thundergod has a foul temper. During the
Primordial Realm, when all the powers were struggling for domination,
Thundergod became legendary for his temper and for being a solitary
figure. He offended quite a few major powers. The only reason why he
was able to survive was because he was extremely powerful and didn’t
take part in any of those wars. That temper of his…even if the
Human Emperors, Tathagata, and Daoist Three Purities visited him,
it’d be useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. He had
personally witnessed the legendary temper of Exalted Celestial
Thundergod! In truth, if Thundergod was a good-natured person, he
could’ve simply spent a few extra moments explaining the situation
to Ning, and Ning naturally would not have pressed him further.
However, Thundergod had instead turned immediately hostile, shouting
for Ning to leave. Clearly, Thundergod really did have an arrogant,
foul disposition that made it so that he didn’t even wish to waste
time explaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
really is excellent.” Subhuti couldn’t help but praise it again.
“Right now, in the Three Realms, the fastest person is the Lord of
All Fiends of the Seamless Alliance. Daofather Goldcrow is on our
side and he is ranked second.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew this quite
well. Daofather Goldcrow was the sole Golden Crow that had survived
Houyi’s slaughter of the ten. Mother Nuwa had saved the Golden Crow
from Houyi. Back then, he had merely been an Empyrean God, but by now
he had become a Daofather. By relying on his Golden Sunstreak divine
ability, he was tremendously powerful and fast. However…the Lord of
All Fiends was even more formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the end of the war
that destroyed the Primordial Era, Mother Nuwa had broken through to
Pangu’s level and slaughtered the Lord of All Things, then forced
the ‘king’ of the Seamless Gate into merging himself into the
Heavenly Daos in order to survive. The Lord of All Fiends, however,
had rescued and led away many of the powerful experts of the Seamless
Gate. They had fled without a trace! To be able to escape the
clutches of a Pangu-level deity…from this, one could see how
formidable the Lord of All Fiends was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major powers of
the Three Realms have tried to come up with an ability like this long
ago, but none of them were successful. Only the Golden Crows are born
with this sort of innate ability. These alien Outsiders…they truly
are formidable figures. Although the body transformation process of
this divine ability is quite difficult, there should be some major
powers in the Three Realm who are capable of succeeding in it.
However, taming Ninehorn Lightning Serpents is another matter.
Thousandrot Godfruit, Myriad Thunders Godgem, chaos nectar…I’ve
heard of all three of them, but the Three Realms doesn’t have any
of them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If some of the most
top-tier major powers on our side were to master this technique, they
might become comparable to the Lord of All Fiends in speed.”
Subhuti let out a long sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Daofather
Goldcrow had the assistance of his Golden Sunstreak divine ability,
in many other areas such as the Heavenly Daos he was far inferior to
the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity. A pity.”
Subhuti shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, handed
Subhuti six little black bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Subhuti was
startled. Ning just looked at his master, not saying a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thought suddenly
entered Subhuti’s mind. A stunned look appeared in his eyes, and he
hurriedly accepted those six black bottles and sent his coresense
into them. The black bottles all contained drops of chaos nectar that
seemed to contain countless tiny worlds within them. Although he had
never seen chaos nectar before, since the various powers of the Three
Realms had slain and soulscoured many alien Outsiders, they had
acquired books and records that taught them how to identify it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon his coresense
sensing how unfathomably profound and mysterious the liquid was, and
how it contained the aura of chaos…Subhuti instantly knew that it
had to be chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Subhuti
looked at Ning, feeling shocked and stunned. He had a very
complicated feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A supreme treasure like
this…this was something the major powers of the Three Realms
weren’t able to acquire, no matter how hard they tried, because
they simply weren’t able to produce it. To harvest chaos nectar
required setting up enormous formation. Even the King of Pangaea had
to work laboriously in order to acquire and set up this formation…and
then, extremely long periods of time had to pass for the nectar to be
harvested. The Three Realms neither had the formation, nor had a
person to set up the formation, and of course it didn’t have enough
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar could
transform into almost anything. For example, the bodies of the
second-stage [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] were all formed through the
power of chaos nectar. It was also usable for taming Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents and many other things as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A treasure like this…Ji
Ning had actually given it up, just like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t, no one
would’ve known that he was in possession of such a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the path of Immortal cultivation was inherently a path that was
against the will of Heaven. Only by seizing enough essence and power
from the world could one walk farther along this path. Although
Subhuti cared deeply Ning highly, that was only because he cared
deeply about every single one of his disciples. He didn’t expect
that Ning would offer up such a huge gift! This was a gift that would
have an enormous impact on the entire Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the supreme figures
of the Three Realms such as Suiren were to master this divine
ability, then when the Endwar finally arrived, Suiren would be able
to attack and withdraw as he pleased. This would have an enormous
impact on the entire war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability,
all by itself, was more important to the Nuwa Alliance than the birth
of one or two new True Gods or Daofathers. But of course, this would
only be true if it were the likes of Suiren and Daoist Three Purities
who ended up training in this divine ability. If a weaker cultivator
was to train in it, the benefit of the technique would become much
lower to the alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day
forth…” Subhuti looked at Ning, sending him a mental message. “As
far as everyone is concerned, it was I, your master, who discovered
this treasure of yours. Understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Foolish child!”
Subhuti looked at Ning. “If everyone knows that you discovered this
treasure…once the word spreads, even some of the major powers of
our own Nuwa Alliance might begin to have evil designs upon you. They
might have the idea of trying to get even more treasures out of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we are all
in the same alliance…during the Primordial Era, we still killed
each other. Think about what sort of personality Thundergod has. And
he’s not even that bad! Our alliance has some truly demonic figures
and some truly vile miscreants. The only reason why we are ‘allies’
is because we are fighting on the same side in the war.” Subhuti
looked at Ning. “You absolutely can’t let people know about any
treasures that you have. Now, I’m just telling you this out of an
abundance of caution. In reality, it should be fine as I’ll only
speak to the likes of the Three Emperors of Mankind and Daoist Three
Purities about this treasure. All of us will sit down and discuss
this, then decide jointly as to who should be the one to cultivate
this divine ability. All of them have excellent temperaments and they
won’t act against a junior like you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti looked at Ning.
He was beginning to like the kid more and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This contribution Ning
had just rendered to their alliance was truly an enormous one.

Chapter 51 - Six Major Powers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning sent mentally,
“Master, will the Seamless Gate notice our conversation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to say.”
Subhuti sent back, “In terms of mastery over spacetime, I am the
number one expert of the Three Realms. I’ve folded space in
multiple layers around Mount Innerheart, making it impossible for any
of the other major powers of the Three Realms to find it. The only
one who can do it is the Seamless Gate’s Lord of the Demonheart,
who has merged himself into the Heavenly Daos. I’m not sure if he
would be able to notice our conversations here or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the chances
that he would be able to listen on an exchange of mental messages
should be comparatively lower,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. They
really did have no better options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had
decided on giving six bottles of chaos nectar and the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique to his master, Ning had mentally
prepared himself for the possibility of the Seamless Gate finding
out! The reason why Ning had offered them up wasn’t purely out of
selflessness; right now, his main goal was to ensure that his wife
and his daughter would be able to stay alive. Although those six
bottles of chaos nectar would be able to help him in increasing his
power a bit further, the benefits of keeping them were vastly
outweighed by the benefits of handing them over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he gave them to one
of the supreme major powers on their side, that person would grow far
more powerful. It might even have a major impact on the final Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although rescuing his
wife was important…victory in the Endwar was even more important!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he was
discovered, the worst-case scenario would be that he would be killed.
However, he would be able to rely on the other two bodies he had
hidden within the stone stele to bring himself back to full power
eventually!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you mastered
this technique?” Subhuti suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Subhuti
smiled and nodded. “To all outsiders, I’ll simply say that I
bestowed this technique upon you and gave you the treasures needed to
train in them. If any major powers on our side ask you, that’s what
you will tell them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On our side?” Ning
pondered for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major powers of
the Seamless Gate wouldn’t dare act against you,” Subhuti sent.
“They wouldn’t dare to cause a great battle between the True Gods
and the Daofathers. You have my talisman with you, so if you
encounter any danger, you can immediately activate it. I’ll know
right away and assist. The major powers on our side, by
contrast…might be more unpredictable. You have to be careful and
vigilant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
other treasures that can be used to train in this divine ability?”
Subhuti couldn’t help but ask this question. “It’s not that I’m
trying to be greedy, it’s simply that this divine ability is going
to be tremendously helpful to our side. And of course, I guarantee
that I won’t let you suffer a loss by handing them over. Three
Purities and the others all have fine treasures that were left behind
by alien Outsiders and even Mother Nuwa herself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have three or four
bottles left,” Ning sent back. “Master, if you need them, I can
give them to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been planning
on keeping the remaining bottles for replenishing his clones as
necessary, and he had also been planning to give a bottle to the most
powerful Fiendgod under his command, Redsnow. He also wished to leave
a bit behind for his daughter…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three or four
bottles?” Subhuti could tell that Ning wasn’t lying. He sent
mentally, “No need. If there’s not enough, it’s not worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar was only
useful when consumed in sufficient quantities. Daofathers and True
Gods, for example, would need at least a hundred bottles of chaos
nectar in order to master the second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods]. For an extremely powerful True God or Daofather such as
Lord Tathagata the Buddha or Daoist Three Purities to suddenly gain
eighteen clones would have a shockingly tremendous impact on the
course of this war…but alas, they didn’t have enough chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Taming Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents also required six bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One or two bottles?
That was only enough to help out Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
They wouldn’t be of much use to True Gods or Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even in the
chaos-kingdom of Pangaea, the core members who were important enough
to be assigned the position of Prisonworld Overseer were only given a
single bottle for their service. From this, one could tell that even
the King of Pangaea only bestowed chaos nectar in extremely small
portions. The vast majority of the chaos nectar remained under the
King of Pangaea’s tight personal control, as at his level the
amount of chaos nectar needed would be absolutely enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep in the primordial
chaos there was a field of medicinal herbs. Next to the field was a
thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple figures had
congregated here in front of the thatched cottage. They included the
elderly, robed Subhuti, the farmer-like Shennong, the heavily
bearded, wild-haired, fur-clad, barbarian-looking Suiren, the
distinguished-looking Fuxi, the calm and upright Daoist Three
Purities, the smiling Lord Tathagata the Buddha, and a stooped figure
who was dressed in tattered gray robes and who wore a savage mask on
his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you have
reviewed this technique.” Subhuti swept them with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures before him
were the true top-level figures of the entire Nuwa Alliance. They all
ruled over mighty domains of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique is
quite excellent, but what’s the use when it’s untrainable?”
Fuxi laughed as he looked towards Subhuti. “Subhuti, what are you
scheming? Spill it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti waved his hand,
causing six black bottles to appear before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s eyes lit
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them were
fools. They had all reviewed the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion
technique, and recorded in the technique was the information that the
lightning serpents could be tamed using six bottles of chaos nectar.
For Subhuti to suddenly produce six such bottles…they naturally
were able to understand what it meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are six bottles
of chaos nectar,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did this chaos
nectar come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These supreme figures
of the Nuwa Alliance all began to grow rather excited. This was
something that would have an impact on the entire war. With their
side strengthened, their chances of victory would be greater…but
alas, at their current level of power it was extremely difficult to
grow even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti explained, “It
was my disciple, Ji Ning, who offered them up. Don’t tell anyone
about this; if you do, you’ll only invite disaster upon my
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
stooped figure with the savage-looking mask suddenly spoke out in a
hoarse voice. These two words were the only words which the stooped
figure had said thus far during this gathering, and he said nothing
else afterwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti gave the
stooped figure a glance. In his heart, he couldn’t help but let out
a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He himself has
already trained in this divine ability. He then gave me remaining
chaos nectar as well as the instructions to the divine ability,”
Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
sighed softly. “For an Empyrean God and True Immortal to encounter
such a tremendous stroke of karmic luck, but still be willing to part
with it…rare, quite rare.” None of them were the slightest bit
surprised that Ning himself had trained in this technique; after all,
any of them would’ve done the same in Ning’s situation. Actually
handing over such a priceless treasure, however, wasn’t something
that just anybody could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has gained
tremendous virtue.” Lord Tathagata smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s
decide who should train in it.” Subhuti swept them with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple was
the one to offer it up. Aren’t you going to train in it?”
Shennong chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of raw
speed, I might not be as fast as the Lord of All Fiends or Goldcrow,
but in terms of fleeing and staying alive, I’m every bit their
equal,” Subhuti said. “No one in the Three Realms is a match for
me in my mastery of spacetime. Although this divine ability would
also be useful to me, it wouldn’t be of THAT much use. Don’t be
shy or modest; hurry up and decide who should be the one to train in
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six present
all fell silent for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let Suiren have it,”
Daoist Three Purities said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, my elder
brother is the most suitable figure.” Shennong nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the others
argued against this decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well. I shall
train in this divine ability, then.” Suiren noded. This man, the
oldest and most powerful member of the human race, didn’t decline
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I owe your
disciple.” Suiren looked towards Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can decide for
yourself as to how you wish to pay him back.” Subhuti smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren was tremendously
powerful. In fact, there were many within the Seamless Alliance who
believed that Suiren was actually the most powerful individual within
the Nuwa Alliance! The invisible aura which Suiren gave off in
particular…it was extremely, extremely similar to the aura which
Pangu had when he established Heaven and Earth. Suiren was extremely
powerful in head-on combat, but he was a bit lacking in terms of
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to train in
the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique…it truly would
be liking putting wings on a tiger. He would instantly grow far more
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stooped figure in
the tattered gray robes suddenly disappeared into thin air, having
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been so many
years, but he’s still unable to get over it…” Fuxi shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one has been able
to convince him. Not even Mother Nuwa was able to convince him. What
can you do?” Subhuti sighed. “That chasm in his heart…only he
himself has the power to leap past it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal World.
Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated within
his thatched cottage, quietly meditating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the
Starseizer world, leaving an incarnation behind within the thatched
cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starseizer world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Manorlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An awe-inspiring horde
of Immortal soldiers all bowed before him. Ning stood there in
midair, staring down at the people before him. There were more than a
hundred thousand Celestial Immortals and far more Loose Immortals.
Most of them came from the army which Daofather Hasbear had given
him, with the rest being the Immortals of the Starseizer world
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu Formation!”
Ning gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish! It
was like a horde of locusts taking flight. A dense throng of
countless Immortals soared into the skies. As soon as Ning had
acquired the [Rahu Formation] and the army, he had moved them all
into the Starseizer world and had them begin to train in it. The
arrangements had been made long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 90,000 Celestial
Immortals and 8 million Loose Immortals had been waiting for a long
period of time. The others were simply there as backup.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Ning at the
center, the 90,000 Celestial Immortals formed into 90,000 veins and
arteries, joining together and connecting with all 8 million Loose
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an incredibly
complicated formation. Even Daofathers who tried to analyze it would
find it headache-inducingly complicated. Fortunately, every single
individual only had to be responsible for his or her specific
assignment. Ning didn’t need to worry about the other parts of the
formation; he was the core, the mind, the commander they needed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An endless flood of
natural energy from Heaven and Earth began to wildly flood towards
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
skies themselves were about to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The multicolored
streaks of natural energy quickly solidified and condensed into
physical form, and a Fiendgod of absolutely terrifying strength began
to be born. First came his legs, his powerful, pitch-black legs.
Slowly, the rest of his torso took form as well. His entire body was
pitch-black in color, but by the sides of his waist appeared sleek,
silver-colored fur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His arms appeared as
well. One arm after another began to take form, until a total of six
mighty, muscular arms had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, his head was
created. His eyes brimmed with a murderous aura…but his face
appeared to be similar to that of Ji Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWAAAAAARRR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Rahu God let
out a furious, Heaven-shaking roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m…actually
somewhat unable to control my temper now?!” Ning was in control of
the Rahu God. The legendary Rahu had four faces and six arms; this
wasn’t from a divine ability, it was how he was born. The formation
which Fuxi had devised, however, only had a single, normal face,
although it did keep all six of Rahu’s arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“90,000 Celestial
Immortals and 8 million Loose Immortals…the amount of natural
energy they have summoned is simply incredible.” Even for Ning,
controlling this much power was incredibly taxing. He was actually
only able to command a very small part of the total power of this
Fiendgod, but despite that his power now vastly, vastly surpassed
that of the perfect Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had other
clones, there was no way he could mix them into the formation. This
was because the 90,000 Celestial Immortals and 8 million Loose
Immortals were mixed together in perfect harmony and balance. If Pure
Yang True Immortals were to join into the formation in lieu of
Celestial Immortals, it would actually cause an imbalance that would
result in the formation becoming even harder to control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Rahu God drew
out six swords, one with each arm. Three of them were the Darknorth
swords, while the other three were Ananda World-Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate.”
The Rahu-Ning murmured to himself, his voice filled with wrath and
malice. Then, six swords in his hands, he teleported out of the
Starseizer world.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Voidboat suddenly
departed from Sword Immortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has left
Sword Immortal world.” The Seamless Gate’s watcher responsible
for this world immediately made the report to his superiors. The
exalted Godking naturally knew right away that Ji Ning had left, but
he didn’t feel too concerned. During this recent period of time, Ji
Ning had often left Sword Immortal world. Given that he had been
quite low-key during the past century or so, without attempting a
single attack, the Godking wasn’t too worried about this departure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…he would suffer
for his negligence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fuyi majorworld.
Outside the world-membrane, a Voidboat suddenly appeared. The
Rahu-Ning was located within the Voidboat, reaching out with his
coresense to scan this major world with it. He quickly encompassed
the entire world with his heartforce. He was much more careful this
time, as it would be extremely easy for others to notice once he
entered a major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fuyi world
really lives up to its reputation. The Seamless Gate has three
headquarters here, one of which has five Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals.” A dim red light flashed through the Rahu-Ning’s eyes.
“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat passed
straight through the Void, entering the Fuyi major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuyi world. Sacred
Mountain Eastrise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peaks of Sacred
Mountain Eastrise pierced high up into the clouds. Every day, Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals would come visit this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
managed to enter the Sacred Mountain. I’ll no longer have to feel
worried about the Fuyi Dao-Palace continuing their pursuit of me. We
monsters were born to eat people. After we became Void-level
Diremonsters, all we did was eat a single city’s worth of people,
but the Fuyi Dao-Palace became dead-set on hunting us down. Thank
goodness Sacred Mountain Eastrise is here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother,
Sacred Mountain Eastrise rose to sudden prominence just a hundred
years ago. Is it really capable of resisting the power of the Fuyi
Dao-Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
Fuyi Dao-Palace once tried to assault it, but they weren’t able to
succeed. Listen, behind Sacred Mountain Eastrise stands the legendary
Seamless Gate. I’ve heard that the Seamless Gate is already strong
enough to battle against the other major powers of the Three Realms
and is currently struggling for supremacy over the Three Realms
without showing any signs of weakness. How could they possibly fear
the Fuyi Dao-Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two Loose Immortal
Diremonsters were chatting amongst themselves, feeling quite
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fuyi Dao-Palace had
unified and taken over the Fuyi world long ago. Naturally, it had
lain down rules of its own! This caused many Diremonsters and
Fiendgods to feel disgrungled. Although some Diremonster cultivators
were able to calmly abstain from a diet of meat, many had delighted
in eating human flesh since they were young. Normally, they had to be
extremely careful due to the suppressive power of the Fuyi
Dao-Palace, and they would only dare to furtively eat a few people
here and there. Whenever they were caught, they would immediately be
faced with the pursuit of the Dao-Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that Sacred
Mountain Eastrise has Empyrean Gods and True Immortals within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we were to become
apprenticed to one of them…that really would be a tremendous stroke
of fortune.” The two loose-haired, savage-looking men walked
forward, shoulder to shoulder. These two were humans, but given how
humanity had flourished throughout the Three Realms, the race had
naturally given birth to a number of viledoers and miscreants.
Clearly, the Seamless Gate was quite an alluring option for these
vile fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous boat
appeared outside of Sacred Mountain Eastrise. The boat was many tens
of thousands of meters long, and atop the boat stood a peerless
six-armed Fiendgod. The baleful aura emanating from him caused the
entire world to seemingly turn gray. The natural world was itself
affected, and countless gray stormclouds began to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Th-that’s…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“G-god…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Fiendgods and
Immortals atop Sacred Mountain Eastrise were all completely
stupefied. Just staring at that peerless Fiendgod caused them to
shiver and feel their hearts fill with fear. In fact, they felt as
though they couldn’t even move their fingers. The invisible
presence and pressure emanating from this titanic Fiendgod caused
even their very thoughts to turn sluggish. They weren’t even able
to think normally. This was terror that sprung from their very
lifeforce itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The body of this
Fiendgod was formed by Ji Ning commanding 90,000 Celestial Immortals
and 8 million Loose Immortals, after all. Its presence alone was far
more terrifying than that of even many True Gods and Daofathers. But
of course, Ning was only able to actually make use of a very small
amount of this Fiendgod’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the Rahu-Ning’s
Darknorth swords flashed outwards, leaving behind a terrifying scar
in the skies as it stabbed towards a barrier of golden light covering
Sacred Mountain Eastrise. The enormous golden barrier covered the
entire mountain and was a protective formation. When the Fuyi
Dao-Palace had attacked, they had been unable to break through this
protective formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword shot out,
seeming to bore a hole through reality itself. The enormous barrier
of golden light trembled for a moment, and then it quickly began to
collapse as the enormous sword bored a hole through it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh my…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He shattered the
formation protecting Sacred Mountain Eastrise with one stance.”
Many Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals were barely able think
properly right now, thanks to the sluggishness of their mind. The
Celestial Immortals and higher-ranking cultivators, however, were
still able to maintain their calm. The five Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals in particular, although absolutely terrified out of their
mind, weren’t particularly affected by the awesome presence of the
Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee right away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them were
both frantic and furious as they tried to come up with ways to
escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning took just
a single step forward, trampling down upon the mountains and causing
the entire mountain range to tremble. Six streaks of sword-light shot
downwards, seeming to cover the entire sky with their might. The five
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals did their best to flee, but they
were all reduced to dust by the sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five!” The
Rahu-Ning took a single step backwards and re-entered the Voidboat.
Swoosh! The Voidboat immediately tore through space and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Within the
vast world of darkness. The Godking was stunned and enraged. “Ji
Ning is attacking again? He actually dares to attack yet again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
absolutely beside himself with rage. He had felt that he had given Ji
Ning quite a bit of face by not attacking Sword Immortal world or
sending anyone to assassinate Ji Ning during the past century. He had
thought that Ji Ning had learned his proper place, as Ji Ning had
been quite peaceful and calm during this past period of time. By now,
the Godking had almost completely forgotten about Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that Ji Ning would attack yet again! “You are courting death.”
This time, the Godking was truly furious. He was an exalted, revered
figure; for Ji Ning to challenge him once was one thing, but a second
time?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you really think
that there is nothing our Seamless Gate can do to you?” The true
body of the Godking immediately departed towards one of the main
headquarters of the Seamless Gate, the First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning moved
with incredible speed, and his power was far greater than it had been
when he was in control of the perfect Heaven Punisher. This was due
to multiple reasons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, more than
a century had passed since he had become an Empyrean God and True
Immortal. His soul had been nourished by both his Pure Yang Jindan as
well as his Empyrean God body, resulting in it growing until it had
reached the limit of power possible. The increased strength of his
soul resulted in him being able to control an increased amount of the
power of the Rahu God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Secondly, over the
course of the past century, Ning’s soul heartforce technique had
also improved significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Third, the Rahu
Formation contained a total of 90,000 Celestial Immortals and 8
million Loose Immortals, and it was a more powerful formation to
begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, in short,
Rahu-Ning’s power was two levels higher than the perfect Heaven
Punisher’s power. Even if he encountered an actual True God or
Daofather, he’d be able to withstand at least a few blows. Of
course, due to the huge difference in their respective mastery of the
Dao, in the end he would still be defeated. The Rahu-Ning’s raw
power, however, was unquestionable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Fuyi major
world, Ning destroyed two of the headquarters in succession, killing
a total of nine Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. The enemies in the
third headquarters all escaped, as Ning was just a bit too slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the Voidboat,
the Rahu-Ning travelled to another major world. Ning’s heartforce
spread out to encompass this world, discovering just two Seamless
Gate headquarters here. However, one of the headquarters was empty,
with the other holding a total of fifteen Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all gathered
together. Are they planning to rely on their formation to stop me?”
The Rahu-Ning smirked coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat quickly
arrived at the Seamless Gate headquarters. This was a citadel built
atop a desert, surrounded by layers of protective formations of
tremendous power. A total of fifteen Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
had joined forces within it, maintaining the formation and ensuring
that it was kept at maximum power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifteen Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals joining forces to maintain a formation. Last
time, Redsnow and I would’ve immediately left upon seeing this. But
this time…things will be different.” The Rahu-Ning felt quite
confident. Previously, when he commanded the perfect Heaven Punisher,
a formation being supported by three or four Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals couldn’t stand against him. Not even fifteen of them,
however, would necessarily be able to withstand the current
Rahu-Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for whether or not
he would actually be able to breach their defenses…the only way to
find out was to give it a try!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteen Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals defended with all their power, filling the
formation with their energy. To build up a headquarters was no small
task; they weren’t willing to give it up so easily. If every
headquarters had to be abandoned as soon as Ji Ning appeared, their
disposition of forces throughout the entire Three Realms would be
thrown into disarray. The Seamless Gate had paid a significant price
in order to infiltrate all of the worlds of the Three Realms; they
couldn’t just change their entire strategy because of Ji Ning. If
they did, the sacrifice would be enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!” The
towering, peerless Rahu-Ning struck out with his six divine swords.
One streak of sword-light after another descended from the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six streaks of
sword-light pierced down towards the layers of protective formations.
With shattering sounds, they pierced through three of the layers, but
this citadel was protected by a total of five layers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!” But by the
time Ning was about to strike a second time, the three shattered
layers had already been repaired by an influx of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Samsara…Heavenbreaker!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning let out a
fierce howl as he brandished his six divine swords. Each sword seemed
to have transformed into a giant warhammer as all six smashed
downwards towards the barrier formations. Under Ning’s control,
each sword suddenly seemed to increase dramatically in weight,
becoming even heavier than a titanic mountain range of ten thousand
kilometers. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Dull, deep thudding
sounds could be heard as the six swords consecutively slammed down
upon the protective barrier as the Rahu-Ning’s six arms swung
around him like the spokes of an enormous windmill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six divine swords
chopped down in an unbroken, never-ending cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a variation of
the ‘Heavenbreaker stance’ of the Brightmoon sword-art that was
used in combination with the [Three Heads, Six Arms] divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samsara Heavenbreaker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
the Rahu-Ning launched a total of thirty-six chops against the
protective barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! All five barriers
were completely destroyed…and the Rahu-Ning charged inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the fifteen
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals simply laughed, laughed in a very
odd manner. At the same time, their bodies began to change. Prior to
this, their auras had been completely different, but now their auras
became completely identical, as did their appearances. All of them
were dressed in bloody robes, and their skin became ashen pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteen blood-robed
figures smiled oddly as they looked at Ning. “I’ll give you these
fifteen clones of mine for the killing…but you are going to die as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning’s sword
light flashed out with apocalyptic power, sweeping forth and
destroying all fifteen clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A trap?” The
Rahu-Ning had kept his coresense active, and he had noticed that two
ripples of power had begun to tear through the fabric of space and
descend upon this major world. “So their plan was to use fifteen of
the bodies of Empyrean God Bloodriver to buy time and keep me here as
their armies assembled to trap me. A pity for them that those fifteen
all died for nothing.”
</P>

Chapter 53 - The Keeper Of The Everwood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go!” The
Rahu-Ning entered his Voidboat. Just as he was about to tear through
space and depart, he suddenly saw lines of golden silk appear within
the blurriness of the Void. These golden strands of silk made it so
that tearing through space was going to be incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. They’ve
altered the Void in this area. It’s now incredibly difficult to
tear through it. It was fairly easy when I came to this major
world…it seems that they made their move when I attacked this
city.” Ji Ning instantly understood what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all of this
took time to describe, in truth it happened in an instant. And, right
at this moment, the space behind and in front of Ning was easily torn
open, resulting in two large boats appearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Alliance
had originiated from the Seamless Chaosworld. Their roots were very
deep, and they had spread out across a total of ten worlds. These ten
mighty worlds were ten utterly enormous military bases, each of which
had Daofathers protecting them. Immortal and Fiendgod armies could be
rapidly dispatched from them to engage in wars of conquest against
the other major worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These ten worlds were
ranked from ‘tenth’ to ‘first’, and the higher the ranking,
the more powerful the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The First World was the
true heart and core of the entire Seamless Alliance. Even the
Allfiend world, protected by the Lord of All Fiends, was at most on
par with the First World. After discovering Ji Ning’s attack, the
Godking had headed straight towards the First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.” The
Godking was standing beside a violet-robed man in a rather respectful
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This violet-robed man
was carrying a deep-violet wooden ruler on his back. His face was
very calm, and he seemed to carry an aura of warmth and amusement
about him. He was in charge of protecting the First World, an
individual who had a truly transcendent status amongst the major
powers of the Seamless Alliance. In fact, prior to the end of the
Primordial Era, he had been second only to the Lord of the
Demonheart. Back then, his status had been a bit higher than that of
even the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He…was Keeper
Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was an extremely
charismatic figure who many of the major powers of the Seamless Gate
admired and were willing to follow and serve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back during the time of
the Seamless Chaosworld, the Lord of the Demonheart and Keeper
Everwood had been two diametrically different types of people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of the
Demonheart loved in battle, delighted in slaughter, and enjoyed
playing with the hearts of others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood was
gentle and kind. He delighted in collecting various types of wood,
which was a very strange hobby for a major power to have. The reason
why he gave himself the name of ‘Everwood’ was because the type
of wood he was the most infatuated with was a type of wood known as
Everwood. This was a form of naturally-occurring wood within the
Seamless Chaosworld. Keeper Everwood found and collected every single
specimen of this type of wood, then titled himself the ‘Keeper of
the Everwood’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent some time
dabbling in formations and was a master of them, but that was just
for fun. His true passion was still his Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He disliked battle, and
he never quarreled with others. Whenever anyone asked him for advice,
he would give them guidance. This, many major powers viewed
themselves as being in his debt. When the Seamless Chaosworld still
existed, his reputation within that world was exceedingly high. If he
wanted to struggle with others over control of the world, the Lord of
the Demonheart would’ve most likely found it extremely difficult to
truly unify it under his command. Fortunately, Keeper Everwood didn’t
desire power, and so he ended up swearing an oath of brotherhood with
the Lord of the Demonheart, becoming the number-two figure of the
entire Seamless Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His power was truly
unfathomable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was extremely
skilled in formations, spells, and divine abilities. Most terrifying
of all was that wooden ruler he carried on his back; his true power
lay in close combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, during the war
which ended the Primordial Era, Mother Nuwa had made a breakthrough
and become a god like Pangu, completely dominating all her foes. Not
even Keeper Everwood had been able to withstand her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood would
have fallen, but fortunately the Lord of All Fiends had been so
talented in his escaping skills that he had managed to save the
Keeper, as well as many of the other experts of the Seamless Gate.
This actions made it so that all the survivors owed him a debt. In
addition, given that he was actually able to escape from the wrath of
the Pangu-level Mother Nuwa, the Lord of All Fiend’s status amongst
the Seamless Chaosworld’s forces instantly skyrocketed, and he
became the number one figure of the modern-day Seamless Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Keeper
Everwood’s power remained unquestioned, and so he guarded over the
First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, prior to
these two alliances turning hostile, Keeper Everwood had many friends
from the Nuwa Alliance. Even the likes of Daoist Three Purities,
Tathagata, and Subhuti had been good friends of him. They were so
close to each other than when the storm had descended, Three Purities
had told Keeper Everwood, “Fellow Daoist Everwood, there’s no
need for you to get involved in this war between our two alliances.
It doesn’t matter if the Seamless Gate is destroyed or if the Nuwa
Alliance is destroyed; I trust that no matter who the victors are,
they won’t make any trouble for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logically speaking, no
one should be capable of transcending beyond the bounds of this war.
Old Man Yuan, for example, tried to maintain a balance between the
two sides as he was unwilling to fight, but in the end both sides
would force him to make a choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood,
however…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance
would’ve permitted him not to take part in this war, promising not
to touch him. The Seamless Alliance didn’t try to force him either.
However, in the end Keeper Everwood decided to stand along with the
Seamless Alliance and his fellows who had come from the chaosworld of
his birth. Still, the fact that he was given a choice was testament
to his charisma.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This young fellow
named Ji Ning is nothing more than a minor nuisance. You are being
too serious about this,” Keeper Everwood said with a chuckle. “You
even had Bloodriver sacrifice fifteen of his clones. With my
‘Brightvoid Worldlock Formation’, his Voidboat shall become much
less effective. He’ll be like a fish caught in the nets. It will be
very hard for him to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For you to come up
with this Brightvoid Worldlock Formation just to deal with him…he
should feel honored as he dies,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s Subhuti’s
disciple, yes?” Keeper Everwood shook his head slowly. He truly
didn’t wish to act against the beloved disciple of a former friend.
However, both alliances were currently warring against each other. If
he showed mercy to his foes, it would be the same as showing cruelty
to his own allies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master, this
is merely Ji Ning’s true body; he still has a Primaltwin,” the
Godking immediately said. “After his true body is slain, his power
will drop dramatically, and he’ll also lose his treasures such as
the Voidboat. He’ll no longer have the power needed to ambush us.
This will be good for both him and us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was what
the Godking said on the surface, in his heart he still felt
resentment. He venerated his master, the Lord of the Demonheart, for
his mercilessness and his willingness to pull up grass by the roots!
But of course, he had to coax this uncle-master of his with the
appropriate words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not as
soft-hearted as you think. Even if I truly kill this disciple of
Subhuti, it doesn’t really matter. This is just the beginning. When
the Endwar comes…” When he thought of the impending Endwar,
Keeper Everwood felt helpless and resigned. However, if he had to
make a choice, he would still choose these ancient, true brothers and
friends he had met back when they had all been born from the
primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three
Purities…Subhuti…either they would die, or his own friends and
brothers would die. One side had to perish. Thus, he had no choice
but to grit his teeth and choose to send Daoist Three Purities and
the others on their way to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking and Keeper
Everwood watched the battle begin from far away. In truth, others
aside from them were watching as well, such as many of the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were two enormous
formations that had been laid out by a pair of Protocosmic
spirit-treasure boats, each filled with 320 Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals. Like the Taiji diagram, one was Yang-aligned while the
other was Yin-aligned. They came together into a perfect whole,
forming the enormous Brightvoid Worldlock Formation. This enormous
formation covered this entire major world, and it was something which
only True Gods and Daofathers could normally accomplish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the formation was
successfully laid out, the planetary membrance became merged into the
formation itself. To tear through the planetary membrane and enter
the Void would thus become extremely difficult and require an
extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, as the
controllers of this formation, the parties on the two boats were able
to easily enter this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This entire major
world has been locked away. He won’t have the time needed to slowly
tear through into the Void, nor will he be able to teleport away and
escape. He’s dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals atop the two ships of the Seamless Gate were both
extremely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning’s previous
assaults, the Godking had been enraged. Worried that Ning might try
to cause trouble again, he had asked Keeper Everwood to come up with
this technique. In truth, this sort of world-locking formation wasn’t
of much use in normal situations! This was because this sort of seal
that had been created by merely a group of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals was rather meaningless to True Gods and Daofathers, who
would be able to easily tear through it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was meaningless in a
war…but it was very useful to catch and kill Ning, like a loach in
the net. Given Keeper Everwood’s skill in the art of formations, he
was able to come up with this technique after spending just three
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now…after all
these years, Ning finally encountered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the two
boats appeared…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” The
Rahu-Ning didn’t hesitate at all. With but a thought, an enormous
black lightning serpent suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It wrapped
itself over the Voidboat…then disappeared with a flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…can’t see
where he went.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too fast…I can’t
even see his movements…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals aboard the two boats were both dazed. This was a
completely different level of speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Ning having
reached the speed of light, the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
aboard the two Seamless Gate ships all stared at the streak of black
lightning that had been left in the skies. After the streak of black
lightning disappeared, they could no longer see any trace of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How are we supposed
to chase him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-how are we…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He instantly
disappeared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all exchanged
glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning quickly
moved far, far away from the two enemy warships. Only then did he
forcibly tear a hole through the Void and move to escape. The golden
threads of light sought to impede him, making the tearing process
very difficult, but because the enemy warships were too far away they
weren’t able to catch up to him at all. Riiiip! The planetary
membrane was finally torn apart and the Voidboat disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…it reappeared
within another world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, so these
actually haven’t fled yet?” The Rahu-Ning rode the Voidboat
forward, assaulting the headquarters of the Seamless Gate on this
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahh! That’s…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at his face!
That’s Ji Ning. Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why didn’t the
Godking warn us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking just
warned us to leave right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He only warned us
NOW?! It’s too late!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning smashed
straight through this headquarters with overwhelming power. The
Godking had been so completely certain that there was no way Ji Ning
would be able to escape that he hadn’t arranged for the other
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals in the nearby major worlds to flee.
Thus…they once more suffered for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. This is
impossible.” The Godking couldn’t believe it, and a look of
madness was in his eyes. “How could Ji Ning have acquired a divine
ability like this? This speed…it’s at the limit of speed possible
under the Heavenly Daos. Wasn’t Goldcrow supposed to be the only
person in the Nuwa Alliance who is this fast? How could Ji Ning be
this fast as well? He’s only human!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A perfect evasion
technique.” Keeper Everwood murmured to himself, “For a human to
be able to execute it…he couldn’t have been born with it. Did the
Nuwa Alliance come up with this divine ability?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do? How should I stop him and kill him?” The Godking
began to panic. “If he’s just allowed to continue like this,
he’ll sweep through one major world after another. Our strategy
throughout the Three Realms…are we going to have to upend it and
give up all our effort just because of him? No. No way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
panicking, but no matter what idea he came up with, he couldn’t
come up with anything that could be used to stop Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.” The
Godking looked at the nearby Keeper Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Keeper
Everwood looked back at the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master, please
advise me,” the Godking said frantically.

Chapter 54 - Berserk
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood looked
towards the Godking, then chuckled. “I have two surefire methods
for success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two?” The
Godking’s eyes lit up. He didn’t even have one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary methods are
useless against someone like Ji Ning, whose speed has reached the
limits set by the Heavenly Daos. Not even major powers can catch up
to him in speed, much less other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.”
Keeper Everwood continued, “At a time like this, the only choice
you have is to compensate through raw numbers. Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals in sufficiently large quantities can kill even True Gods
and Daofathers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he is
extremely fast, then send out large groups of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to form a truly massive formation that he cannot escape
from,” Keeper Everwood said. “However…the number you will need
to truly trap and lock in Ji Ning is enormous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many would be
needed?” The Godking immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least five
thousand,” Keeper Everwood replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s heart
instantly clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Seamless
Infinity Formation was formed using 289 Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals, but it was only able to completely lock down a region of
ten thousand kilometers, preventing Ji Ning from escaping from it.
The ‘Brightvoid Worldlock Formation was able to cover an entire
major world, but it just made travel more difficult. Given a bit of
extra time, Ji Ning would still be able to tear through the barrier
and escape into the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To create a formation
that Ji Ning was unable to escape from that was as vast as a major
world…the number of True Immortals and Empyrean Gods needed would
be staggeringly large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightvoid
Worldlock Formation itself required 640 Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to set up. If they really wanted to set up a formation that
Ji Ning was guaranteed to be unable to escape from…yes, more than
five thousand would be needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That many…” The
Godking frowned. “It will be very difficult for our Seamless Gate
to send our more than five thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
all at once. The two hundred I sent last time came from the Third
World. This time I had to come and speak with you, uncle-master,
before I could send out six hundred. Uncle-master, your First World
has many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, so sending six hundred
won’t destabilize it much. But to send out more than five
thousand…even with you here, things will grow very dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood nodded.
“I have more than ten thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
here! If we were to send out more than five thousand, it’s very
possible that the Nuwa Alliance would immediately send out their own
army of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to assault the First World.
With all the True Gods and Daofathers both sides standing on the
sidelines…there’s no way the First World would be able to
survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Godking nodded. In terms of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, the
Seamless Gate had far fewer than the Nuwa Alliance. In fact, their
total combat power was lower as well! This was why they had to rely
on their intelligence reports and their golems to match the Nuwa
Alliance. The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate
were all hiding within the First World, Second World, Third World,
and other bases. By relying on the protective formations that covered
these worlds, they would be able to withstand any attacks from the
Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if any of the ten
mighty bases, even the mightiest First World, was to send out more
than five thousand of their experts…they would drop so dramatically
in power that they would be in danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we had all ten
worlds mobilize together…” The Godking hesitated. “If they
immediately mobilized, headed out, instantly killed Ji Ning, then
immediately returned, it’s possible that the Nuwa Alliance wouldn’t
be able to launch an attack in time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he himself knew
that this would only be true in the most ideal of situations. In
reality…given how berserk Ji Ning was, and how the major powers of
the Nuwa Alliance were all paying attention to him, once the Seamless
Gate began any large-scale mobilizations the Nuwa Alliance would
immediately react accordingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re fast
enough…it’s still possible.” The Godking gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This solution was a
gamble. He would be gambling on if his side would be able to take
care of things fast enough. If they weren’t…things would become
extremely dangerous. Once thousands of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals were sent out, the Nuwa Alliance might waylay and ambush
them…or they might launch a massive attack on the ten Seamless
Alliance worlds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The choice is
yours.” Keeper Everwood looked at the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the second
method?” The Godking immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just have a True God
or Daofather kill him,” Keeper Everwood said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather?!” The
Godking was boggled. “B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning had
trained in an extremely powerful evasion technique, an extremely
powerful True God or Daofather would still be able to kill him. Even
though the Daofather would be inferior in raw speed, he would still
be able to use spells and other abilities such as restrictive
formations to slow down and bind Ji Ning, making it impossible for
him to even move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, if Lord
Tathagata the Buddha was to attack, he would be able to lock Heaven
and Earth with a wave of his hands, placing a Five Elements seal that
would render Ning completely immobile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They might not be able
to match up to that young fellow in speed, but they could suppress
him so that he wouldn’t be able to use that speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why the ten
Golden Crows were so powerful was primarily because of their leader,
the Emperor of Monsters. He himself had the power of a True God and
Daofather, as well as the [Golden Sunstreak] technique; this was why
the other major powers were unable to catch him. In the end, it had
been Houyi’s specially-manufactured arrows which had slain the
Emperor of Monsters. As for those other nine…they instantly became
much less dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, both
alliances had a tacit understanding; neither side wanted to
prematurely spark off the Endwar of major powers. Both sides
understood that given the current balance of power, the Endwar would
most likely result in devastating casualties for both sides, with the
Seamless Gate having a higher chance of being wiped out. However,
even if the Nuwa Alliance was to win, the survivors would be very few
in number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood said
calmly, “If you do that, there are two possible outcomes. The first
is that once the Daofather slays Ji Ning and violates our unspoken
accords, the Nuwa Alliance will be so enraged that they will
immediately launch the Endwar. The second possible outcome is that
after Ji Ning is slain, the Nuwa Alliance will be extremely angry but
still be unwilling to launch the Endwar right away. If we make some
sacrifices and concessions, we’ll be able to turn the page on the
matter. I judge the second possible outcome as being more likely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a war between
two alliances. Their enemies had to consider the bigger picture as
well. It was indeed unlikely that they would actually launch the
Endwar just because of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this is still a
gamble.” Keeper Everwood looked towards the Godking. “All you can
do is first kill Ji Ning, then wait to see what the Nuwa Alliance’s
reaction is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” The
Godking’s head hurt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two options lay before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was to send
out more than five thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. This
was virtually equivalent to the army that would be sent out for a
Realmwar in one of the top-tier realms. Even ordinary True Gods and
Daofathers would be surrounded and killed by such an army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was to have
a top-tier True God or Daofather attack and instantly kill Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two gambles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the nominal leader
of the Seamless Alliance…the Godking’s head hurt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there really no
other options available?” The Godking asked worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two options I
mentioned just now are all sure-fire ways of killing Ji Ning. There
are other methods, but there is no guarantee of success,” Keeper
Everwood said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master, pray
tell,” the Godking said hurriedly. Even methods that weren’t
guaranteed to succeed would at least have a chance of killing Ji
Ning. He wasn’t willing to use either of those two methods; both
methods would be throwing the entire Seamless Gate into a bet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood said,
“Have you noticed? When Ji Ning uses that [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] evasion technique, he first enters the Voidboat, then
executes the technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Godking nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason for that
is because the mysteries of this technique primarily lay within the
serpent itself,” Keeper Deadwood said. “If he simply was going to
use it on himself, he naturally wouldn’t need to rely on the
Voidboat; he’d be able to instantly flee. But he is currently
carrying a large number of Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals
with him, in a formation that is shaped like an enormous Rahu God. He
isn’t in perfect control of the Rahu God’s power. Thus, if he was
to use the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent to cover up the entire Rahu
God, it would place an enormous burden on the serpent, preventing it
from flying too far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking nodded, his
eyes lighting up. “Right. The same was true for Goldcrow; he’s
ridiculously fast when he flies by himself, but when he carries other
experts along with him, he’ll become slower. The only option is for
Goldcrow to put those people inside a magic treasure first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly.” Keeper
Everwood nodded. “Thus, if the Rahu-Ning first enters the Voidboat,
he can allow the Voidboat to complete cover and envelope his own
energy, ensuring that the leakage doesn’t disturb the lightning
serpent. Only then does he use the serpent to envelop the Voidboat,
which is why he is able to move with such speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whenever he attacks
a region, he’ll immediately enter his Voidboat and then flee after
he encounters any danger. Entering the Voidboat is a
prerequisite…which gives us a very short window of time,” Keeper
Everwood said. “Your only chance to defeat him lies in this short
window.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the more important the minor details would be in an important
battle. In that tiny window of time, it was entirely possible that
they might be able to take Ji Ning’s life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.” The
Godking nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…no wonder
Keeper Everwood had said that this wasn’t a surefire method. A True
God or Daofather would naturally be able to seize that window to
launch an attack, but if the attacks were merely Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals…it would be far more difficult to exploit that
window of opportunity. Ji Ning himself was quite powerful, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run! Run! RUN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We poured our blood
and sweat into this place and paid an enormous price to build it up.
Are we really going to give it up just like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about it! If
we don’t go, we’re going to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
bases all began to evacuate. The major powers of the Seamless
Alliance all had their coresenses locked onto Ning, and as soon as he
drew near a major world the local Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of
the Seamless Gate would instantly flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Running?” The
Rahu-Ning used his six swords to execute the Heavenbreaker stance.
With heaven-destroying power, he blasted the formations around the
base into pulp. Mountains collapsed, palaces imploded, and everything
was destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can’t kill
you, then I’ll wipe out all of your bases throughout the entire
Three Realms. I’ll destroy all the bases of the Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Building them up was
hard, but destroying them will be simple. I refuse to believe that
you won’t bow your heads!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning
completely changed plans. Given that he was being watched, it was
unlikely that he would be able to kill many more Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals. Then…he would simply cause destruction. He would
constantly destroy the bases they had worked so hard to build up. It
was thanks to these bases that the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
of the Seamless Gate were able to infiltrate the major worlds; it was
these bases that allowed them to withstand the attacks of the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who owned those worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…Ning began to
wreck them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sight caused the
major powers of the Seamless Gate to all feel heartache and worry. In
fact, they all began to send mental messages to the Godking.
“Godking, you have to stop Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, hurry up
and come up with some ideas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These major powers
truly wanted to personally intervene and kill Ji Ning. However, all
of them understood that many of the major powers of the Nuwa Alliance
had to be watching Ji Ning as well. If one of them truly was to
strike out against him, the Nuwa Alliance would instantly
counterattack. In fact, the ensuing fight might result in True Gods
and Daofathers dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their guesses were
correct. Human Emperor Suiren, who had just incurred an enormous debt
to Ning thanks to the gift of six bottles of chaos nectar and the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique, was paying extremely close
attention right now. He absolutely would not permit any enemy True
Gods or Daofathers to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any fights had to be
between Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. This was the rule!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive, towering
Rahu-Ning swept out with his swords, causing everything in their path
to blow apart. The mountains collapsed and the rivers and seas were
overturned. No one could stop him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Rahu-Ning
suddenly frowned. His heartforce had been active this entire time,
and it now discovered that the space next to him had suddenly been
torn apart. He couldn’t help but turn to look, only to see a
golden-armored man standing next to the tear in space. The tall,
muscular, golden-armored man was wielding an enormous greatbow in his
hands, and he had already shot out an arrow. The tearing in the
planetary membrane was caused by that arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow carried a
terrifying amount of power within it. It was like a shooting star,
leaving behind a dull red scar in the skies as it shot towards Ning.
As for the Rahu-Ning, he hadn’t returned to the Voidboat yet; he
really wasn’t going to be able to escape in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
arrow. He must’ve eaten a Daofruit of primordial chaos first!”
The Rahu-Ning didn’t panic at all. The sword in his hand
transformed into a black hole as it swept forward to greet the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most perfected
stance of Ning’s Brightmoon sword-art was the defensive stance, the
‘Soleheart’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the very first
of the five stances Ning had come up with. It must be understood that
when Ning had created this sword-art, he had suppressed his power to
make it weaker than his foes; this stance was perfect for constantly
whittling away at an enemy’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The arrow that
fell into the black hole did indeed contain the power of primordial
chaos within it. It just barely managed to escape the pull of the
black hole, but the arrow itself became warped and crooked. The
warped arrow landed against the arm of the Rahu-Ning. Although Ning
was only able to use a tiny portion of the full power of the Rahu
God, its body was still incredibly powerful, far more so than that of
an ordinary True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the full-strength
arrow probably would’ve only been able to injure Ning, much less
this weakened, warped arrow which had struck Ning on the arm. The
powerful collision did cause the Rahu-Ning’s arm to go momentarily
numb, but it quickly recovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine archer,
Empyrean God Swansong, fled quite quickly.” The Rahu-Ning stared
into the Void outside the planetary membrane. The tear in space had
already begun to heal, while the golden-armored man that had stood
outside the world had fled long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Swansong
knew very well that if his arrow failed, it was entirely possible
that Ji Ning would be able to kill him, given how fast the Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent was. Thus, as soon as he unleashed his arrow, he
had immediately fled without even waiting to see what the result was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SEAMLESS GATE!”
The Rahu-Ning raised his head, bellowing with rage. “You’ve
condemned my wife to the torment of the Infinity Hells, and so I’m
going to destroy ALL of your bases! I will kill…kill…KILL! Kill
until there is nothing left!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His powerful killing
intent meshed perfectly with the nature of the Rahu Formation. In
fact, Ning even felt as though he was able to control slightly more
power now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He entered the
Voidboat, then roamed forward, beginning a wild spree of destruction
through the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The First World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
had an ugly look on his face. “Given the strength of Ji Ning’s
heartforce, the only option we have is to attack from far away.
There’s no way to get close to him at all. But the only suitable
attack method we can use from that distance is archery. But he’s
actually able to take head-on an attack from a supreme divine archer
like Empyrean God Swansong, even when a Daofruit of chaos has been
used. What should I do? What exactly should I do?” The black-robed
Godking was truly becoming frazzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Did he really have no
other options aside from watching Ning destroy everything like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, what’s
this all about? Ji Ning was raving about his wife having been sent
into the Infinity Hells?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, is Ji Ning
acting so wildly because his wife is trapped in the Infinity Hells?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate all began to query the Godking with their coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although some of the
major powers of the Seamless Gate knew that it was their spy, Yu Wei,
who had destroyed Shennong’s medicine during the Crimsonbright
Realmwar, very few knew that Yu Wei had ended up imprisoned within
the Infinity Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Keeper Everwood,
who still stood next to the Godking, he was even more puzzled. “Ji
Ning’s wife? Who? And what’s this about her being imprisoned
inside the Infinity Hells?” Given his exalted status, he naturally
hadn’t paid any attention to the Crimsonbright Realmwar.

Chapter 55 - Bowing Their Heads
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking hurriedly
explained to Keeper Everwood, “Ji Ning’s wife is named Yu Wei.
She was one of the countless spies we inserted into the Nuwa
Alliance. The two of them had extremely deep feelings for each other.
I once ordered Yu Wei to kill Ji Ning, but she actually disobeyed!
Right then and there, I wanted to kill her, but given that the storm
had descended and that capable people are rare, I decided to spare
her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the
Crimsonbright Realmwar, it can be said that Yu Wei rendered some
accomplishments. I brought her soul back to us. During that war, Ji
Ning’s heartforce reached the fourth level, and so he was able to
completely reverse the course of the Crimsonbright Realmwar. I saw
how shocking his talent was, and how deep his affection for Yu Wei
was, and so I forced him to make a choice. If he joined the Seamless
Gate, I would allow the two of them to reunite, and I promised that
we would protect his family and his home. We would even bestow gifts
and divine abilities upon him. If, however, he decided to stay with
the Nuwa Alliance, I would send Yu Wei into the Infinity Hells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…ended up
choosing the Nuwa Alliance,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war between the two
alliances was a war for survival. It wasn’t appropriate for him to
really criticize the Godking for his decisions, as the Godking was,
nominally speaking, the leader of the entire Seamless Gate. He had
the authority to make this sort of decision on his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While explaining to
Everwood, the Godking also used his coresense to speak to the other
major powers of his alliance, giving them a basic explanation. Given
his status, no one really criticized him for his decision to handle
things as he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you weren’t
wrong in your judgment of Ji Ning; he really is quite formidable.
And, just as you said, the feelings between him and Yu Wei were quite
deep.” Keeper Everwood continued, “Now that he’s learned this
evasion technique…although he’s still just a young fellow, he’s
also become a big problem. You need to think hard on how you want to
handle this problem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking nodded, a
hint of gloom in his eyes. In truth, he felt tremendous fury in his
heart at how Ji Ning was pressuring him. But no matter how angry he
was, he still didn’t dare to directly against him. In terms of raw
power, he wasn’t one of the truly supreme figures of the Three
Realms. His side had the likes of Keeper Everwood and the Lord of All
Fiends, while the Three Realms had Suiren, Shennong, Daoist Three
Purities. All of these figures were unquestionably superior to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An azure-robed man was
seated atop the roof of a palace, holding a gourd of wine and
drinking from it. He seemed both tipsy and sober as he stared far off
into the distance. He sighed softly. “That young fellow who took
part in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny in the Grand Xia…he’s
already grown up, and has reached such a level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s now able to
cause a stir throughout the entire Three Realms, causing headaches
for even the Seamless Gate, which is helpless against him. All those
years ago, I felt certain that he had the potential to become a
powerful Sword Immortal…but who would’ve thought he’d end up
becoming much more powerful than I predicted?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, the only person which Lu Dongbin had taken a fancy
to was Ji Ning, no others. In fact, he had personally requested that
the Xia Emperor allow him to take on Ji Ning as his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, he hadn’t
been able to take Ji Ning on. However…because he felt something was
off, he decided to take on Ji Ning’s Dao-companion, Yu Wei,
instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that my
disciple was a girl with terrible luck. In the end, I wasn’t able
to change her destiny.” Lu Dongbin shook his head. “The Godking
of the Seamless Gate is the disciple of the Lord of the Demonheart;
he’s incredibly skilled in beguiling and charming others. He was
able to make my disciple so very loyal to him. Alas…from what I
just heard, it seems as though she ended up being imprisoned within
the Infinity Hells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Yu Wei was to
know that for her sake, Ji Ning was actually willing to war against
the Seamless Gate across the Three Realms…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin shook his
head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He always felt
tremendous sympathy for lovers. As he roamed the Three Realms, he was
often referred to as a ‘Moon Elder’ 1 because he enjoyed
manipulating events to help lovers come together in the end. As for
Ji Ning and Yu Wei? One was a Sword Immortal who he viewed with
tremendous favor, the other was his own beloved disciple. But
alas…their destiny wasn’t something that he, Lu Dongbin, could
change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A war against the
massive Seamless Gate…I hope you will achieve what you desire.”
Lu Dongbin raised his head, drinking more wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a feasting hall
inside the imperial palace of a minor world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an old,
coughing eunuch seated at the front, legs outstretched. Next to him
was a younger eunuch who was helping to massage his legs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Try some of this
cake.” Not too far away was the eunuch responsible for managing the
feasting hall. He was even more solicitous than the younger eunuch,
and he delivered a platter of food to the old eunuch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Not bad.” The
old eunuch nodded in praise. But suddenly, he frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, get out.
Let me be by myself for a bit,” he suddenly instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes!”
Instantly, all the surrounding eunuchs bowed respectfully and left,
leaving him by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old eunuch’s gaze
pierced through the Void, falling upon the massive Rahu-Ning who was
within a distant major world, destroying a base of the Seamless Gate.
The old eunuch murmured softly to himself, “When I gave the kid a
copy of my [Heart Sutra], I didn’t expect that he would grow this
quickly. It seems that as of now, aside from True Gods and
Daofathers, no one can do anything to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a freak. A
freak!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the looks of
it…he might really become a True God and Daofather,” the old
eunuch murmured to himself. “And that evasion technique. Tsk. I
wonder where it came from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thundergod major
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the levitating
mountain peak, the towering Exalted Celestial Thundergod opened his
eyes. His coresense reached out through the Void to observe the
enraged Rahu-Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent?” Thundergod frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually has a
divine ability like this. Last time, he came to beg me for a
lightning serpent…could it be that it was for this ability?”
Thundergod naturally felt tremendous desire for this divine ability.
He wanted to learn it as well. With the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
technique and his current level of power, his chances of surviving
the tribulation would increase a hundredfold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, even
though Ning had the Rahu Formation, the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals of the Seamless Gate were still capable of killing him! But
now that he had the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique,
his survival ability instantly skyrocketed. The Seamless Gate would
have to send out more than five thousand Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to deal with him. How could such a force be so easily
deployed?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This evasion technique,
mated with fourth-stage heartforce, a soul heartforce technique, and
the Rahu Formation produced an utter monster in the form of Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This evasion-type
divine ability…” Exalted Celestial Thundergod truly wanted to
learn it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the major powers
of the Nuwa Alliance as well as the major powers of the Seamless
Alliance all had to admit that the current Ji Ning was incredibly
hard to deal with! His power was absolutely enough to force the
Seamless Gate to change its entire strategy and disposition of forces
throughout the Three Realms. They would have to give up the product
of their blood, sweat, and tears!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenbreaker
stance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning’s
swords suddenly increased to become many tens of thousands of meters
long. They slammed downwards with such power that the very pillars of
Heaven would quake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering pagoda
before Ning was cracked open. Ning’s other five swords chopped down
in succession, and in a total of six strikes the towering pagoda had
been completely reduced to rubble. All the protective barriers and
formations had been completely destroyed! It had been very hard to
build them up, but wrecking them had been quite easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next one.” The
Rahu-Ning once more boarded his Voidboat and began to advance towards
his next target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
still refuses to bow their head. They still refuse to speak to me.
Good. Very good. I’ve only destroyed their bases on a hundred major
worlds. There’s still plenty to come. I’ll take it slow. All of
the bases on all the worlds…I’m going to destroy them all!” The
Rahu-Ning had no thoughts in his mind save one - to destroy until the
Seamless Gate lowered its head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s continuous
rampage of destruction brought the Godking tremendous pressure. With
each wasted moment, Ji Ning was advancing to yet another base on a
major world and destroying it. The Godking’s face grew uglier and
uglier. He was frantically pondering and weighing his options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The venerable Seamless
Gate represented the former Seamless Chaosworld itself. Were they
really going to be forced by Ji Ning to lower their heads? But what
of the Seamless Gate’s face?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If, however, they did
not lower their heads…were they really going to give up their
infiltration networks throughout the entire Three Realms? If they had
to completely change their strategy, the backup strategy wouldn’t
be as effective as the current one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The storm had already
arrived, and the Seamless Gate’s fate would be decided by it. At a
time like this…face actually wasn’t as important as it normally
might be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Juts as the black-robed
Godking was pondering, another figure suddenly appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood glanced
at the red-robed, azure-haired man who had just arrived. Grinning, he
said, “Windfiend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood.” The
red-robed, azure-haired man nodded slightly to him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord.” The
Godking hurriedly called out respectfully to the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This man was dressed in
red robes, had unbound azure hair, a thick beard, and eyes that were
filled with azure light. He was the undisputed most powerful figure
of the entire Seamless Alliance, and also its most revered figure. He
was the savior of the Seamless Gate…the Lord of All Fiends!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was born from the
primordial chaos, and like the Lord of the Demonheart, he was born an
Elder God. The Lord of All Fiends was born with control over a
Heavenly Dao…the Heavenly Dao of Wind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Daos of
the Seamless Chaosworld had been Primordial Chaos, Heart, Earth,
Fire, Water, and Wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As an Elder Fiend of
the Seamless Chaosworld, he naturally had a very high status.
However, he had always been quite low-key. It was only during the
battle that ended the Primordial Era that he had suddenly displayed
his incredible abilities! Nuwa had become a Pangu-level deity when
the Lord of All Fiends had suddenly exploded with power, saving many
of the major powers of the Seamless Gate, along with many Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals. He had fled with them by his side, and not
even Mother Nuwa had been able to catch up to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sudden display of
power had caused the Nuwa Alliance to feel certain that he, the Lord
of All Fiends, had been hiding his power all along. His power was
truly unfathomable, and everyone decided that he had to be the most
powerful figure within the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed, it was
true. The Lord of All Fiends sat guard over the Allfiend world, with
held many of Seamless Gate secrets pertaining to the art of golems.
The Nuwa Alliance had tried their best to infiltrate it, but they had
been unable to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason the
Godking was the nominal leader was because the Lord of All Fiends
wasn’t willing to dirty his hands with all the miscellaneous tasks
that were involved in leadership. He, however, was the figure who
truly had the highest level of status within the Seamless Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Successfully
enduring this storm is what matters. We have to survive.” The Lord
of All Fiends looked at the Godking, then gave his instructions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
Godking said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
nodded, then disappeared into thin air. He had merely sent one of his
incarnations here; his true body remained on guard within the
Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking no longer
hesitated. The words of the Lord of All Fiends caused him to make up
his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Godking
suddenly sneered coldly. “The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of
the Nuwa Alliance have already started to assemble. It seems as
though they are waiting for us to mobilize against Ji Ning. Once I
send out a few thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, the Nuwa
Alliance will most likely launch an immediate attack. Everyone really
is fighting to seize every advantage possible to survive this storm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning was
seated aboard his Voidboat. He continued to advance through the
various major worlds, and the Seamless Gate didn’t move to stop
him. Clearly, they knew very well that a few hundred Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals simply weren’t capable of catching up to Ji
Ning. As for mobilizing larger numbers…they didn’t dare to do it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast lake. The island
at the center of the lake had already been reduced to rubble, and the
Rahu-Ning was standing in the middle of the rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The natural energy of
Heaven and Earth began to coalesce around Ning. It condensed into a
figure that was dressed in black-robes. The Rahu-Ning glanced towards
the figure, then froze. His gaze became completely glued to the
figure. He naturally was able to recognize the figure; this was the
Godking of the Seamless Gate. However, this was merely an incarnation
of the Godking; it didn’t pose any threat at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win!” The
black-robed Godking spoke out.
