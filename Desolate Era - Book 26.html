Chapter 1 - The Owner of the Eternal Blood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The instant that Ji
Ning stepped through the towering gates and into the endless dark of
the Castrum Divinitus, space began to twist around him. A moment
later, the world brightened up as he found himself within a hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This hallway had rather
uneven walls that had torches stuck into them. The torches were
blazing merrily, filling the hallway with their light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stood
there in the hallway and scanned the area. No one else was in sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Why have I been separated from Youji and the others?” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a faint wave
of energy rippled out from up ahead. Ning hurriedly turned to look,
only to see strands of fire fly out from the two torches and coalesce
in the air, transforming into the form of a barefoot, gauze-clad
maiden. The maiden had long, beautiful green hair. Although her body
was covered by a layer of thin gauze, she was essentially nude for
all intents and purposes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the
formation-spirit of the Castrum Divinitus. This is one of my
incarnations,” the maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. “Why
have I been separated from the others?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone who took
part in the Samsara Grinders and survived shall be blessed with good
fortune. However, since you each walk different paths you shall each
be given unique bits of karmic fortune. Thus, every single person has
been teleported to a different part of the Castrum Divinitus,” the
maiden said. “Come with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed behind
her obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, every single
person had been teleported to a different region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth,
Arroyo, had also appeared in an empty hallway. He scanned the hallway
with his bloodsea eyes, a hint of impatience visible within them.
Suddenly, a barefoot, gauze-covered maiden suddenly appeared before
his very eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the
formation-spirit of the Castrum Divinitus. This is one of my
incarnations. Follow me,” the maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the divine
blood of the Eternal?” Arroyo asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
the Eternal?” The maiden looked at him, a strange smile playing on
her beautiful face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, the Eternal
blood. My performance atop the Samsara Grinders should’ve been the
best of the five. The Goldeye Golem himself said that our group’s
performance was good enough to warrant the Eternal blood being
awarded, but that I would have to enter the Castrum Divinitus to
acquire it.” Arroyo gazed at the maiden, a look of urgency in his
eyes. “I don’t give a damn about any other ‘blessings’. I
just want the Eternal blood right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden looked at
him, then slowly shook her head. “There is none.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None?” Arroyo was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None for you, that
is.” The maiden looked at him calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you
saying?” Arroyo began to grow upset.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is simple. The
divine blood of the Eternal shall be given to a different cultivator,
not you.” The maiden smiled. “But of course, you’ll still be
blessed with some good karmic fortune.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
Arroyo’s eyes instantly turned red with fury. He howled angrily, “I
was the most powerful one! Which of the four surviving World-level
cultivators can possibly compare to me? That new Chaos Immortal, Su
Youji? World God Dragonbinder of the Badlands Court? My servant?
Fukai? None of them are qualified! Daolord Allgod was an ancient
power and an incredibly proud man. There’s no way he would be so
unfair!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the trials
which Master set down were quite fair,” the maiden said. “And the
results of the trial were… that you did not qualify to acquire the
Eternal blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SHIT!!!” Arroyo
was both enraged and panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he not be
enraged? How could he not panic? His very life was riding on him
gaining the Eternal blood! Both he and Fukai had paid enormous prices
just to make it from the Fog Sea to the gates of the Castrum
Divinitus. Both had experienced countless dangers, but they had been
willing to risk their lives multiple times because they needed the
Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they acquired the
Eternal blood, their status would instantly skyrocket!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they did not… they
would die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one would be able to
save him. Not even his father would be able to save him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it made no sense.
After he made his breakthrough atop the Samsara Grinders, he was
definitely the most powerful of the five surviving World Gods. He had
felt certain that the Eternal blood would fall into his hands… and
yet, reality had proven otherwise. How could he not be angry? How
could he not panic?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened? Who was it? World God Dragonbinder? No way, he was only
able to win because of his Dao-seal. Fukai? He won in a pathetic
fashion, and he is much weaker than me. My own servant? His
performance was completely unremarkable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo continued to
ponder the matter. “Perhaps the Flamefairy, Su Youji? Mm…
possible. She is a brand new Chaos Immortal, but she was able to kill
Darkfall! It could be said she punched well above her weight…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it Su Youji?”
Arroyo looked at the maiden before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a secret,”
the maiden said. “No need for you to ask.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, wait…
something’s off. Daolord Allgod was an incredibly proud figure,
while Su Youji is extremely weak. The only reason she even survived
was because of that freakishly strong Elder God! How could Daolord
Allgod possibly have been willing to give her the Eternal blood?
Hell, he’d probably give it to that freak of an Elder God before
he’d give it to her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Arroyo’s
face turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That freak of an
Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo suddenly
remembered the words that the three-eyed man had said just before the
trial of the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the surviving
cultivators, they will each blessed with a small bit of fortune. The
cultivator whose performance was the best will have a chance of
acquiring the divine blood of the Eternal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The cultivator whose
performance was the best… right. The word was ‘cultivator’.
World Gods and Chaos Immortals are cultivators, but so too are Elder
Gods.” When Arroyo carefully thought back to what had been said and
what had happened, he realized that it all fit perfectly. It was
entirely possible that the freakishly strong Elder God had been the
one to win the Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of ‘best
performance’? For an Elder God to end up killing a master-class
World God, albeit through the usage of a small trick, was an utterly
inconceivable feat. Arroyo himself had merely slain a supreme World
God while originally being a supreme World God himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. If we factor
in that Elder God…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That freak of an
Elder God does indeed stand a better chance to earn the Eternal blood
than me.” Arroyo turned to stare at the maiden before him, then
growled, “It was that freak of an Elder God, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you, it is a
secret.” The maiden remained as calm as ever. “Enough. Stop
wasting time. Since you survived, you’ll be blessed with good
fortune. Follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. I don’t
want it.” A cold light was flickering in Arroyo’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t want
it?” The maiden frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I want to
leave the Castrum Divinitus immediately,” Arroyo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope you don’t
regret it,” the maiden said. “Others would beg for the chance to
be blessed with such good fortune. I recommend that you at least take
a look at it. You can always leave after doing so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need it,”
Arroyo said calmly. If every single survivor was going to be blessed
with a bit of karmic luck, how good could it possibly be? In
addition, as far as he was concerned, no blessing mattered at all if
he didn’t find the Eternal blood. He would still end up dying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, I’ll let you leave.” The maiden nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-robed Fukai
stared at the maiden before him, an ugly look on his face. “I knew
it. The Eternal blood was awarded to someone else! It must’ve
fallen into Arroyo’s hands. No… I still have a chance! If I can
kill Arroyo, I can seize the Eternal blood!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he’s
more powerful than me now that he’s made a breakthrough? I was
completely unable to use most of my treasures during the trial of the
Samsara Grinders. If I use all of them, I can dominate anyone below
the Samsara Daolord level.” A berserk look was in the gold-robed
youth’s eyes. “Once I kill Arroyo, the Eternal blood will be
mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,” the
maiden instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need any
‘blessings’. I want to leave the Castrum Divinitus immediately,”
the gold-robed Fukai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to leave
immediately?” The maiden was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
gold-robed youth nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No regrets?” The
maiden asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No regrets.”
Madness could be seen flickering in Fukai’s eyes. He had been
pushed to a precipice! He felt certain that the Eternal blood was now
in Arroyo’s hands. If he wasn’t able to seize it, he would
definitely die. His only chance of staying alive was to kill Arroyo
before the man was able to leave this chaosworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wasn’t able to
do so and if Arroyo was able to escape this chaosworld, there would
be no chance to stop him whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How odd. One person
after another has refused the blessing of good fortune, instead
choosing to leave the Castrum Divinitus right away,” the maiden
mused to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One person after
another?” Fukai was stunned upon hearing this. “Who left? Was it
Arroyo?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden glanced at
him. “This is a secret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has to be Arroyo.
I want to leave right away! Immediately! As fast as possible!”
Fukai was panicking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you wish.” The
maiden nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was calmly but
curiously following behind the maiden leading the way before him. Her
bare feet gently glided over the floor as she advanced, soon leading
him to an enormous stone archway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.” The maiden
went past the stone arch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed inside.
Upon doing so, light flashed in front of him. This was an enormous
hall that was filled with many statues. There had to be thousands of
these enormous stone statues here! Ning swept the hall with his gaze.
It had to be at least ten kilometers high and a hundred kilometers in
diameter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning saw that a long narrow table was located in a corner of the
massive hall. Atop this table was a crystalline globe that glowed
with white light.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 2 - The Aeonian Kingdom
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden’s lips
curved upwards slightly as she turned to gaze in that direction in an
intrigued manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared out of nowhere. It was the bald three-eyed man who was the
First Guardian and Commander of the Castrum Divinitus - the Goldeye
Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
slightly surprised when he saw the Goldeye Golem appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
congratulations on having won the divine blood of the Eternal,” the
Goldeye Golem said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know my name?”
Ning was rather surprised. During his conversations with World God
Dragonbinder and the others atop the plaza in front of the Castrum
Divinitus, Ning had never revealed his name. Any mention of his name
would’ve occurred during their mental conversations, resulting in
the likes of Fukai and Arroyo still having no idea as to exactly who
Ning was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing that occurs
within the Allgod Estate can escape my eyes,” the nearby maiden
said. “I heard about you from ‘Myriad Mountains’ quite some
time ago. Enough. Go ahead and take a look. The Eternal blood is
within that crystal globe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it going to
me?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was rather
pleased, he was also quite calm. For most cultivators, what mattered
the most was their insights into the Dao. This was what allowed them
to reach higher levels of cultivation. As for treasures, they were of
secondary importance! There was a limit to useful an outside source
of help would be. Ning was already comparable to a master-class World
God, but no amount of treasures would allow him to be comparable to a
Samsara Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Samsara Daolord who
was skilled in illusions could instantly plunge Ning into an illusory
world with a single glance. Ning wouldn’t be able to resist it, and
he wouldn’t even have a chance to use any of his treasures. This
was what happened when one was at a much lower level of cultivation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said,” the
Goldeye Golem said, “After the trial of the Samsara Grinders comes
to an end, the cultivator whose performance was the best will have a
chance of acquiring the divine blood of the Eternal. You were the
cultivator whose performance was the best.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivator?” Ning
blinked, then quickly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, right!
Cultivator! World-level cultivators are cultivators, but so too are
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.” The Goldeye Golem roared with
laughter. “Those two kids, Arroyo and Fukai? Hmph! How could I
possibly let the Eternal blood go to them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
puzzled. What was this all about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
you, then based on the rules which Master set down all those years
ago, I truly would’ve been forced to hand the Eternal blood over to
Arroyo. But since you came, me giving the blood to you instead is
still in keeping with Master’s rules.” The Goldeye Golem pointed
towards the table. “Go open it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded, then walked over towards the table. He was quite curious as
well. Both Arroyo and Fukai had an extremely large number of
treasures, but they were desperate and willing to pay any price to
acquire this Eternal blood. What sort of treasure was it, exactly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation-spirit of
the Castrum Divinitus and the Goldeye Golem exchanged glances as they
watched Ning move towards the table. Both of them were smiling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal blood.”
Ning walked to the table, staring at the crystal ball that was
glowing with hazy light. After carefully inspecting it, he was able
to tell that it was actually composed of two separate parts, an upper
part and a lower part. Ning reached out to grab the crystal ball,
then applied a bit of pressure to it. Whoosh! The two parts began to
swivel in opposite directions. After Ning gave it a slight tug, the
two parts completely separated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly terrifying
aura that was far beyond anything Ning could’ve imagined instantly
blasted forth into his mind, striking against his soul and his
truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! Thud!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face was
completely ashen as he took two heavy, stumbling steps backwards. His
mind was completely blank, and the two halves of the crystal ball
fell out of his hands and onto the ground with a crashing sound.
However, the fist-sized globe of blood-streaked golden liquid that
had been slowly flowing inside of the crystal ball continued to hover
in midair. As it slowly spun and swiveled, it released an aura of
utterly incomprehensible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after a long
period of time passed did Ning manage to regain his faculties and
recover from the sudden shock of that terrifying aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning
regained his senses, he couldn’t help but furiously retreat several
kilometers before he was able to feel slightly less nauseous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the divine
blood of the Eternal?” Ning stared at the fist-sized globule of
blood that was hovering in the air. He had never imagined that a
single drop of blood essence could brim with such incredible power.
He had encountered other Eternal weapons and had attuned himself to
the exalted sword-aura that was located within Violetjewel’s
quintessence core, but this was the first time that he was completely
shaking with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was his very soul
that was shaking. He was utterly horrified! The aura from the blood
alone had instantly caused his mind to go completely blank, rendering
him completely incapable of thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This is the
divine blood of the Eternal, the Eternal blood of Emperor Melobo,”
the Goldeye Golem said. “Years ago, Master was able to heavily
wound Emperor Melobo, hacking off a large amount of his flesh. Master
took that large amount of flesh and blood, then distilled it into
this single drop of Eternal blood. This essentially represents half
of the entire lifeforce vitality of Emperor Melobo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. After you
bring the Eternal blood out of this place, you absolutely must not
open the globe.” The Goldeye Golem waved his hand, causing the two
fallen halves of the crystal globe to fly into his hand. He resealed
the globule of Eternal blood into the crystal ball, then locked it
tightly. That terrifying aura instantly vanished. He then tossed that
crystal globe, sending it flying towards Ning like a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning caught it.
Puzzled, he asked, “I cannot open it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The members of the
Aeonian Kingdom are able to sense this Eternal blood, but so long as
you remain here in the Castrum Divinitus they will not dare to come
and take it.” The Goldeye Golem explained, “But if you were to
open the crystal globe while outside the Allgod Estate, the
terrifying experts of the Aeonians will immediately pursue you upon
sensing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. He
hurriedly asked, “What is this ‘Aeonian Kingdom’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something which you
weren’t meant to know about. Generally speaking, it is rare for
even World-level experts to have any interactions with them. Still,
once you break through to become a World God you will be an
extraordinary figure. You probably should get a better sense of them
now,” the Goldeye Golem said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me explain to
him,” the maiden suddenly interjected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, you explain.”
The Goldeye Golem had a hint of a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden looked at
Ning. “The Endless Territories are filled with countless
cultivators. Do you know what the most powerful organization in the
Endless Territories is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Alliance!”
Ning said, then chuckled. “Senior ‘Myriad Mountains’ mentioned
them to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Dao
Alliance, an alliance that comprises virtually all of the cultivators
of the Endless Territories.” The maiden nodded. “Cultivators are
by nature unrestrained figures that like to do as they please. Why,
then would they join together to form an alliance? It is precisely
because there exist certain creatures which are born enemies to all
cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Born enemies?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The maiden
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you probably
know, the endless primordial chaos is filled with countless mysteries
and has given birth to many unique races,” the maiden said.
“Ordinary cultivators who originally started off as mortals were
generally born on a chaosworld and slowly grew up there. Even
natural-born Fiendgods are born from the Worldheart of a chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, there are
some special types of lifeforms that are different. They were brought
into being within the primordial chaos due to certain special, unique
circumstances, and they have certain special abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then again… most
of those creatures are fairly rare. In fact, some races might have
just one or two representatives in all the Endless Territories. There
is no way they can compete against the Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, there is
one organization that can. We don’t know where they came from, and
although they are fairly rare they number in the hundreds. Every
single member of this race possesses at least the power of a Samsara
Daolord,” the maiden said. “They set up the ‘Aeonian Kingdom’
and call themselves the ‘Aeonians’. Much like us, they need to
engage in cultivation, but there is a major difference! If they can
kill and devour other Samsara Daolords, they can grow much more
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devour other Samsara
Daolords?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” The maiden
nodded. “Devour them, just like cultivators might devour food or
fine wine. To them, Samsara Daolords are delicacies to be feasted
on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden continued,
“The countless cultivators of the Aeonian Kingdom wish to grow more
powerful and walk farther on their paths. The Aeonians, however, seek
to devour us. Thus, we are born enemies.” The maiden’s gaze
turned cold. “My master’s Dao-companion was devoured by Emperor
Melobo, which was why Master went so berserk in his efforts to slay
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
shivered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could such
creatures even exist? Creatures that could actually devour Samsara
Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a race, the
Aeonians are fairly few in number. It takes a long time for a new
Eternal to be born, but they’ve been in existence for an even
longer period of time. Multiple Eternal Emperors stand guard over
their Aeonian Kingdom, making it so that even the Dao Alliance is
unable to break into it.” The maiden laughed. “In all honesty,
they don’t really matter that much. The Aeonian Kingdom is actually
much weaker than the Dao Alliance, as the Dao Alliance is an alliance
of all the cultivators of the Endless Territories. It has countless
experts within it! The Aeonian Kingdom’s advantage lies in the fact
that its members are extremely unified, with all of their experts
living together in the same place. Their Aeonian Kingdom is also
protected by an utterly inconceivable treasure. If it wasn’t for
that treasure, they would’ve been wiped out by the Dao Alliance a
long time ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The endless
primordial chaos has given birth to many different races of
creatures. This race, the Aeonians, rely on devouring our Samsara
Daolords to grow more powerful. As a result, they are one of our most
hated enemies. In truth, there are actually many types of lifeforms
that are both more powerful and more numerous than the Aeonians.
There are also types of lifeforms that both rarer and more
individually powerful as well. They have existed for countless years
and possess simply inconceivable amounts of power,” the maiden
said. “However… the most powerful organization shall forever
remain the Dao Alliance! The Dao Alliance has far more cultivators
and its ranks are all but endless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. It was
true. The Badlands Territory was a perfect example. It was filled to
the brim with cultivators; when did Ning ever see other types of
lifeforms within it?

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked at the
crystal globe in his hands, then asked, “So… what can I do with
this Eternal blood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This drop of Eternal
blood isn’t that valuable to the Dao Alliance. At most, they would
use it to refine certain pills or rear certain unique bugbeasts,”
the maiden said. “However, it is incredibly, incredibly important
to the Aeonians. This drop of Eternal blood is enough to allow any
member of their race to skyrocket in power! It represents nearly half
the vital essence of Emperor Melobo, after all. Almost half of his
blood and flesh was used in the refining of this drop of divine
blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any member of the
Aeonians who knows that you are in possession of this blood will try
to hunt you down and kill you,” the maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. So it
wasn’t of use to him, but the Aeonian Kingdom would do anything to
get it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, don’t
worry. The Badlands Territory is one of the fairly central regions of
the Dao Alliance. The Aeonians would never dare to encroach upon this
territory! At most, they would send some of their World-level pawns.”
The maiden continued, “To tell you the truth, both of us suspect
that Fukai and Arroyo are most likely pawns of the Aeonians.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They want the
Eternal blood too much, far too much. It doesn’t make sense.” The
Goldeye Golem agreed. “The Allgod Estate has many rare treasures
within it, but the only thing they care about is the Eternal blood.
In addition, both of them led squads of ten World-level servants,
have many treasures, and have Eternal weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldeye Golem shook
his head. “They have so many treasures and such an extraordinary
background, yet they are completely fixated on the Eternal blood and
are willing to sacrifice anything to get it. This is more than enough
to make us suspect that they are the running dogs of the Aeonians.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Right.
They had to be lackeys at the most, as true members of the Aeonians
were incredibly rare and were all at least at the Samsara Daolord
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, I
have nothing more than my suspicions,” the Goldeye Golem said. “In
the end, they followed all of Master’s rules as they made it
through many dangerous regions to come to the gates of the Castrum
Divinitus, then survived the trial of the Samsara Grinders. If it
wasn’t for you, I would’ve been forced to give this drop of
Eternal blood to Arroyo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This drop of Eternal
blood won’t be of much use to you. Once you leave this place, hurry
over to the Badlands Court,” the Goldeye Golem said. “Tell
Daolord Badlands that you acquired a drop of Eternal blood and that
you wish to sell it to the Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby maiden
nodded in agreement. “Daolord Badlands is extraordinarily powerful.
Although he has yet to reach the Verge of the Daomerge, he is an
impressively powerful Daolord of the Endless Territories. In
Numerancy, at least, he can rank as one of the top three Daolords in
all the Endless Territories. If he can advance by just one more step
and reach the Verge, he’ll most likely be every bit as strong as
Master once was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As strong as Daolord
Allgod was?” Ning was secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands truly
was an incredible figure. If he reached the Verge, he would be
comparable to Daolord Allgod? No wonder even Daolord Solesky was so
courteous to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You needn’t worry
that a power such as Daolord Badlands would lust after your drop of
Eternal blood.” The maiden laughed. “Handing it over to him is
the safest solution. If you mention it to the other Samsara Daolords
of the Dao Alliance, nine out of ten would choose to simply kill you
and seize it for themselves. Although this drop of Eternal blood
isn’t that valuable to the Dao Alliance, they’d still be willing
to pay a price of roughly two million cubes of chaos nectar to
purchase it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two MILLION cubes?”
Ning was rather stunned. This was like manna falling from the
heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, wealth and
treasures didn’t matter that much. In the end, they were all
outside sources of strength. Personal strength was what mattered the
most!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aeonian Kingdom
would probably be willing to pay ten million cubes.” The maiden
chuckled. “But there is no way the Dao Alliance would ever sell it
to them. It would only result in an Aeonian expert becoming even more
powerful and dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two million? Ten
million?” This was a simply staggering amount of wealth for Ning.
Suddenly, Ning remembered his big brother Daolord Solesky telling him
that he had given Daolord Badlands enough treasures to create two
perfect avatars. This was all for the sake of convincing Daolord
Badlands to assist him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately asked,
“How much wealth would be needed in order for a Samsara Daolord to
create a perfect avatar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A perfect one?”
The maiden grinned as she looked at Ning. “Most Samsara Daolords
generally create simple and rather crude avatars. With each step they
take, they tread the line between life and death, after all. Only
after reaching an inconceivable level of power would they dare to go
and create an avatar which could be described as ‘perfect’. Thus,
you would probably need at least ten million cubes worth of treasure
in order to create a perfect avatar! Even for Samsara Daolords who
are at the Verge, this is is a sum that represents all the wealth and
treasures they possess.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning
understood. His big brother Daolord Solesky must have sold off nearly
all of his possessions in order to acquire enough wealth to convince
Daolord Badlands to help him. Daolord Solesky was a Palace Lord of
Vastheaven Palace and had lived for countless years. This time, for
the sake of his Daomerge, he had been willing to bring out almost
everything he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten million cubes is
normally a sum which only Samsara Daolords at the Verge can produce,”
the maiden said. “Normal, weaker Samsara Daolords generally have a
networth of just a few hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar. In
other words, this drop of Eternal blood is worth as much as all the
combined treasures of multiple ‘ordinary’ Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldeye Golem said
solemnly, “The endless primordial chaos is filled with countless
hidden treasures. A single mysterious leaf might be worth millions of
cubes of chaos nectar. For example, a single drop of Mirrorheart
Water is worth enough to drive mad even a Samsara Daolord who is at
the Verge. They’d be willing to spend ten million cubes of chaos
nectar to buy such a treasure, but they wouldn’t find anyone
willing to sell to them. However, all these things are illusory.
Treasures are nothing more than outside sources of strength. In the
end, success in cultivation requires you to rely on yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Daolord Solesky
had gone to the Waveshift World, he had been searching for a special
treasure. For the sake of finding that treasure, Daolord Solesky had
first risked his life in the Windsource Ruins to acquire that
‘Talisman of Eternity’, then paid an utterly enormous price to
convince Daolord Badlands to help him out. They had then delved deep
into the Waveshift World. From this, one could see that there were
indeed some treasures that would drive even the most powerful of
Daolords mad with desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. In the end,
all treasures are nothing more than outside sources of help.” The
maiden sighed. “For the sake of his Daomerge, my master risked his
life to find certain useful treasures and also invited many of his
friends to help him out. He did everything he possibly could to
prepare for his Daomerge, but in the end he still failed. However,
there are legends of ancient powers who made no preparations at all.
They naturally completed their Daomerge while sleeping and dreaming,
winning eternity for themselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end,
cultivation is what matters the most.” The maiden sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
come to understand this point long ago. Honestly, everyone did,
including Daolord Allgod and Daolord Solesky. However, they had
reached the end of their cultivation path and were unable to advance
any further. They had reached the Verge of the Daomerge but weren’t
confident in succeeding in it. It was only natural that they would go
try and find treasures that might help them out and increase their
odds of succeeding in their Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You now know how you
should dispose of this drop of Eternal blood.” The maiden pointed
at the statues surrounding them. The great hall was a hundred
kilometers in diameter, and its four walls were filled with thousands
of statues. “Master personally carved all of these statues.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alchemy, artificing,
formations… Master was skilled in many, many things. This is why he
titled himself ‘Allgod’,” the maiden said. “Master even tried
to train in the Dao of the Sword. For the sake of his cultivation,
Master inspected the skills and sword-arts of more than five thousand
World-level experts who walked the path of the Dao of the Sword. All
of these World-level experts had completely different sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden continued,
“After Master viewed their sword-arts, he carved these five
thousand-plus statues.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single statue
is different and represents a different World-level cultivator’s
sword-arts,” the maiden said. “After visualizing and mastering
all of these different sword-arts and spending all this effort in
carving these statues, Master’s skill in the Dao of the Sword had
reached the level of a new Samsara Daolord who specialized in
sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless
upon hearing this. This sort of cultivation method was simply…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viewing the sword-arts
of more than five thousand World-level experts who trained in the Dao
of the Sword? The entire Badlands Territory probably didn’t hold so
many experts of the sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
carvings, he had reached the level of a new Samsara Daolord who had
ascended through the Dao of the Sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, Master
gave it up. As he put it, he simply didn’t have any talent for the
Dao of the Sword,” the maiden said. “Master actually spent a
total of multiple chaos cycles in order to first master the
sword-arts of all of those World-level experts, then carve these
thousands of statues.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had indeed heard
from the formation-spirit of the Ten Thousand Mountains that Daolord
Allgod “wasn’t that skilled in the Dao of the Sword.” However,
that was only in comparison to his other Daos. Daolord Allgod had
been so incredibly skilled in other areas that he before dying, he
had been able to set up a formation that frightened even Eternal
Emperors. The golem he had made, the Goldeye Golem, was comparable to
major powers who had reached the Verge of the Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Dao of the
Sword? He was merely comparable to new Samsara Daolords who
specialized in this Dao. By comparison, he truly “wasn’t that
skilled in the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spend some time
meditating on these statues. These five thousand-plus statues
represent more than five thousand different types of sword-arts.
Master often said that all Daos are linked. As a result, from these
many sword-arts he ended up discovering a path that would allow
someone to break through to become a Samsara Daolord,” the maiden
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, then walked over to stare at the statues. Suddenly, he turned
his head and asked, “How much time do I have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As much time as you
want!” The maiden laughed. “You can spend one or two chaos cycles
here if you wish. I trust that Fukai and Arroyo won’t wait outside
the Allgod Estate for such a long period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are waiting
outside?” Ning was slightly startled. He had already anticipated
this possibility, but for it to actually occur still made him feel
uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The two of them
did not wish to be given any blessings or treasures. Both of them
chose to leave the Allgod Estate right away. If my prediction is
correct, both are definitely waiting for you outside,” the maiden
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who cared about them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These statues
represented more than five thousand different sword-arts. This was
plenty to keep Ning occupied for a very, very long period of time. He
would spend his time cultivating here. As for Fukai and Arroyo? They
could just wait outside.
</P>

Chapter 4 - Ji Ning’s Path to the Dao of the Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning said hurriedly,
“Please assist me in something, seniors. Please tell my retainer,
Su Youji, not to panic. She should simply wait for me patiently.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sure, leave it to
me.” The formation-spirit maiden laughed. “Spend as much time
here as you wish. Whenever you wish to leave the Allgod Estate, just
let me know and I’ll teleport both you and Su Youji together. Oh,
right. World God Dragonbinder is a member of your group, right? If he
leaves on his own, he’ll probably be ambushed and killed as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “Please have World God Dragonbinder wait ten years after Su
Youji and I leave. Only then should he leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t going to
leave until he became a World-level expert. By then, even if World
God Dragonbinder did join them he wouldn’t be of that much
assistance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making his
requests, Ning walked towards one of the walls of this enormous hall.
The walls were all filled with enormous sculptures that bore the
likenesses of many different cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How marvelous.”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh in amazement as he stared at the
statues.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sculpting skills
were simply inconceivable.” Every single sculpture had its own
unique sword-aura. They were all completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the fiery
idol which Ning had acquired earlier contained eight different types
of Fire-attribute intent, as well as an incredibly powerful
technique. As for these thousands of sculptures, every single
sculpture contained a unique sword-intent. They didn’t actually
contain any specific sword-arts, but for an expert of the Dao of the
Sword such as Ning, every single engraving and carving on those
enormous statues was a sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Explosive and
dominating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
sculpture before him. This sculpture had required more than ten
thousand strokes of the sculptor blade in order to be created. Some
of the strokes seemed rather crude and unsightly, but they slowly
came together to form an increasingly marvelous whole. Clearly, as
Daolord Allgod had watched this cultivator train, the Daolord had
slowly gained an increasingly deeper understanding of the sword-arts
involved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is
ice-cold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ephemeral and
carefree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange and
unpredictable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dark and shadowy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at all of
the surrounding sculptures, each one giving him a completely
different feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no rush to
meditate on them. He slowly strolled forward, carefully inspecting
each statue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a veritable
sea of sword-arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single statue
embodied a unique type of sword-art, and every single sword-art was
incredibly profound. Ning was quite astute in judging these sword
arts. He could tell that all of these sword-arts were at the level of
a master-class World God’s sword-arts. The reason why it had taken
Daolord Allgod so many chaos cycles on this project was because
simply finding more than five thousand master-class World Gods of the
Dao of the Sword was an incredibly time-consuming process. During
this process, Daolord Allgod made a breakthrough in his Dao of the
Sword, rising to the level of an new Samsara Daolord’s mastery of
the sword. If he hadn’t made this breakthrough, he probably
would’ve continued to hunt down more and more master-class World
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon breaking through
and finding his own path, he had understood the general direction
which his own Dao of the Sword would follow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Allgod
Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three figures were
seated in the lotus position atop the clouds, their senses spread out
to cover this entire chaosworld. If so much as a bug tried to fly
out, they would immediately detect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were the
blood-robed Arroyo, the gold-robed Fukai, and World God Boneplate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had immediately
left the Allgod Estate, then ran into each other in the outside
world. Fukai had wanted to fight with Arroyo, but Arroyo immediately
began to berate him and curse at him. “You imbecile, I left the
Allgod Estate before you. Would I be sitting here waiting for you if
I had the Eternal blood? I would’ve left long ago! I didn’t get
the damn blood. If you don’t believe me, I’ll swear a lifeblood
oath, alright?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was willing to
compromise because he wanted to make use of Fukai’s strength! “That
freak of an Elder God was the one to obtain the Eternal blood. If
he’s the cautious type, he’ll probably stay inside the Allgod
Estate until he becomes a World-level expert himself. He was already
comparable to a master-class World God. Once he breaks through, he’ll
probably be as strong as I am. Fukai, the two of us will need to join
forces if we want to be able to shut him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai glowered. “Don’t
worry, Arroyo. If neither of us can get the Eternal blood, both of us
will die. But you are overestimating that Elder God’s abilities.
Even if he does become a World-level expert, his sword-arts are far
inferior to yours. He might have some incredibly powerful divine
abilities or secret arts, but I wager he’ll at most become a
supreme World God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo shook his head.
“Don’t underestimate him. We can’t afford to make any
mistakes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Fukai
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the three of
them had sat down in the clouds, setting up a permanent vigil over
the entire chaosworld with their godsense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming a World
God, one’s soul and divine power would join together and be able to
detect distant ripples of power through something known as
‘godsense’. Chaos Immortals had something similar called
chaosense, but the two were essentially the same. However, if one’s
heartforce was able to break through to the sixth level then one
would truly have incredibly scanning abilities that could catch
anyone offguard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were all
extremely formidable figures. It must be understood that even the
Daofathers of the Three Realms were capable of scanning the entire
Three Realms with their senses. These three mighty World Gods
naturally found it quite easy to keep a constant vigil over an entire
chaosworld. In fact, they were also capable of completely locking
down the space around the chaosworld and making it so that no one
would be able to teleport out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once he comes out,
he dies!” Arroyo’s eyes were filled with the crashing waves of a
bloody sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.” Fukai’s
face was cold as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Either Ji Ning died or
the two of them died! There were no other options!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on, day by
day, but Ji Ning did not come out. As for the three World Gods, they
waited like a trio of patient hunters, not growing restless at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Castrum
Divinitus. Inside the Hall of Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still slowly
strolling through the hall, staring at each and every sculpture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than five thousand
sword-arts, with no two sword-arts alike!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
spellbound by what he saw. He felt as though he was swimming within a
sea of knowledge. It was all too stunning. Ning had never felt this
stunned before, not even when he had seen the many sword-arts which
World God Northrest had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of those sword-arts
had been the product of a single cultivator, after all. These
sword-arts were created by more than five thousand different
cultivators. This was a completely different situation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single cultivator
had their own special insights into the Dao. They might create many
sword-arts, but in the end the sword-arts they created would belong
within a single overarching system. However, these thousands of
cultivators were all completely different individuals with completely
different backgrounds, thoughts, insights, and sword-arts. This truly
was an all-encompassing selection of sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long, long ago…
before the weapon known as the ‘sword’ even existed… a creature
picked up a long, flat piece of metal and used it as a weapon.
Slowly, certain mysteries and insights were developed for the
application of this weapon, this ‘sword’. The first sword-arts
began to be created, and over time it was qualified to be described
as a Dao of its own, the Dao of the Sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Countless years have
gone past since then. The trillions of cultivators of the Endless
Territories have passed down many generations of legacies, resulting
in the Dao of the Sword becoming increasingly profound. Multiple
Samsara Daolords have found their own paths within it, and deep
within the primordial chaos there lies a place which holds the prime
essence of the sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in the end…
all of it stems from this single, seemingly simple weapon - the
sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since that day
long ago when Ning’s understanding of the sword had changed, the
entire Dao of the Sword had changed in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through these thousands
of sword-arts, Ning could see how all the different sword-arts
advanced from simplicity to complexity and profundity. The carvings
which Daolord Allgod had created represented himself and how he
slowly learned more and more about the start. His earliest carvings
were rather crude, but his later ones became quite marvelous. This
made it even easier for Ning to understand and analyze them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the tip of the
sword can actually be used like this? That means ‘Blood Drop’
stance can be redefined in many new ways…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So my ‘Shadowless’
stance isn’t sufficiently shadowless. This… this stance right
here is what ‘shadowless’ truly means!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at one
sword-art after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone specialized in
something different. Some sword-arts had truly reached the pinnacle
in certain areas and exceeded Ning’s wildest imaginations. For
example, Ning’s ‘Blood Drop’ stance could be described as a
particularly ferocious and fast technique, but in this hall Ning saw
at least a hundred different sword-arts that truly struck with the
speed and strength of a celestial comet. These sword-arts were truly,
incomparably dazzling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This process of
breaking down and comprehending the fundamental underpinnings of so
many sword-arts resulted in Ning’s own insights rising at an
incredible pace. Prior to this, Ning had reached a bottleneck in his
attempts to master the third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the
‘Great Firmament’ stance. However, as Ning’s insights into the
sword continued to rise, he slowly but naturally came to grasp and
completely understand this stance. He broke through! He was now
completely capable of advancing to the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… Ning did
not!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was completely
intoxicated and mesmerized by this sea of swords. He didn’t want to
let himself grow distracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to
mentally disassemble and inspect every single sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, a great tree
began to take form within Ning’s mind. This great tree was the
‘true nature of the sword’, and it started off with more than
five thousand branches, each branch symbolizing a specific type of
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s insights
continued to develop, some of the branches began to cluster together
and grow into large boughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a truly
priceless experience, an enormous bit of good fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, as far as Ning
was concerned this experience was far more valuable to him than the
Eternal blood. The Eternal blood was nothing more than a source of
outside help, but these thousands of sculptures would help him grow
more personally powerful. The unsightly markings left atop the
sculptures were especially helpful, because Daolord Allgod had
personally left those markings as he had studied the Dao of the
Sword. Thus, the first ones were fairly simple and allowed Ning to
dissect them in a fairly easy fashion. If everything was incredibly
profound and abstruse, there would’ve been no way for Ning to
analyze them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great tree in
Ning’s mind which represent the Dao of the Sword began to grow
larger and larger. More and more of the various branches began to
congregate together and merge into large boughs. The branches began
to grow fewer and fewer in number, from several thousand to several
hundred, then to one hundred, then to a few dozen…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mastery of the
sword was constantly rising without him even being aware of it.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is indeed
a blessed place for anyone seeking to meditate on the Dao of Fire.”
Su Youji frowned slightly. “However, no matter how hard I try I am
unable to make any further improvements whatsoever. Ugh. According to
what the formation-spirit of Castrum Divinitus said, Master is
currently meditating as well. I wonder how long he will take. It has
already been more than three thousand years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had been in
the Castrum Divinitus for more than a thousand years already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending a bit of
time firming up her foundation, she had gained the power of an
ordinary World-level cultivator. After spending nearly three thousand
years meditating in this location, a blessed place for meditating on
the Dao of Fire, Su Youji had advanced to become comparable to an
elite World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that although Daolord Allgod was not skilled in the Dao of the Sword,
he was incredibly talented in the Dao of Lightning, the Dao of Fire,
and many other Daos. Su Youji had benefited greatly from her exposure
to this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose I’ll
just have to keep waiting.” Su Youji had no other options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been three
thousand years, but he still hasn’t come out.” Arroyo, Fukai, and
Boneplate were still quietly keeping a watch over the entire
chaosworld from their position above the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai had a gloomy look
on his face. “I imagine that this freak of an Elder God suspects
something, which is why he insists on delaying and remaining within
the Allgod Estate. However, breaking through to become a World God
isn’t an easy feat, even for a freak like him. Three thousand
years? It is entirely possible that he might spend thirty thousand
years or three hundred thousand years without making a breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap and
just keep waiting,” Arroyo said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them felt
tremendous pressure, and this pressure caused their hearts to become
filled with an intense desire to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of those old
bastards want to acquire the divine blood of the Eternal, but none of
them dare to come in person. All they dare to do is send World-level
experts like us for it.” Fukai was rather resentful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They even
made acquiring the Eternal blood part of our Awakening test.”
Arroyo shook his head. “This is the Badlands Territory, and Daolord
Badlands is one of the most skilled Numerancy experts of the entire
Endless Territories. If any of those old bastards dared to enter the
Badlands Territory, Daolord Badlands would probably be able to divine
it right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Fukai
nodded. Daolord Badlands was a very frightening person indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless Territories
was an incredibly vast place. Not even Daolord Allgod would’ve
dared to claim that he was the most powerful Daolord of the Endless
Territories. Daolord Badlands, however, was ranked as one of the top
three Numerancy experts of this entire realm! Numerancy experts like
him would easily be able to predict and calculate when danger was
coming without even needing to leave the safety of his own home. The
Aeonians were the hated foes of the entire Dao Alliance. If any
Aeonian dared to enter this place, he would find it almost impossible
to avoid the Numerancy divinations of Daolord Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, this was
one of the central regions of the Dao Alliance. Once the Aeonian’s
presence was discovered, there would be no way for him to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Aeonians,
as a race, generally tried to avoid the terrifying members of the Dao
Alliance whose Numerancy skills made them virtually omniscient. Only
the truly terrifying members of their race who were comparable to
Daolord Allgod in his prime would dare to trespass through places
like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no one to
blame but ourselves for not being able to Awaken ourselves,” Fukai
sent mentally. “If we were able to become true Samsara Daolords on
our own, Awakening to become true members of the Aeonian race, we
wouldn’t have to risk our lives to pass this trial in such a
manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Arroyo
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them could
rely on Pseudo Samsara Pills to make their breakthrough, but if they
did so they would have almost no potential for any future
breakthroughs. There would be no way for them to truly Awaken, nor
would they be acknowledged as members of the Aeonian race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to rely on
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alternate option
was to have the Aeonian Kingdom help them Awaken, but an enormous
price would need to be paid. Thus, the Aeonian Kingdom had given them
a test. They were to bring back the Eternal blood of Emperor Melobo,
and if they succeeded the Aeonian Kingdom would help one of them
Awaken! The Eternal blood wasn’t that important to the Dao
Alliance, but it was incredibly important to the Aeonian Kingdom,
enough so that they would be willing to pay the price necessary to
help one of their descendants Awaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of their
descendants had done everything they could to fight over this
mission. In the end, it had been Fukai and Arroyo who had managed to
succeed in having it assigned to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the orders
given by the Aeonian Kingdom, if they succeeded in acquiring the
Eternal blood their status would skyrocket, and they would be
Awakened to become true members of the Aeonian race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if they failed…
they would die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fukai, as per the
lifeblood oath we swore all those years ago, once that freak of an
Elder God appears we’ll have to work together to seize the Eternal
blood from him. Once we acquire it, we’ll fight to the death. The
survivor will take the Eternal blood back to the Aeonian Kingdom.”
Arroyo looked at Fukai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally.” Fukai
felt quite confident as well. In a true life-and-death battle, he
would unleash every single ability he had to offer. He truly didn’t
fear anyone below the Samsara Daolord level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three thousand years
is nothing. Even if we wait thirty thousand years or three hundred
thousand years, it would be worth it.” A cold light flashed through
Arroyo’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo and Fukai waited
impatiently on the outside. From the inside, Su Youji was left to
speculate on how long she would have to wait for her master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
completely absorbed within that sea of sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never
experienced something like this before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Never in his entire
life had he felt so confident in his own sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere within the hall, then turned to stare at the thousands of
sculptures on the four walls. At the very center of the hall there
was a large pagoda-shaped tower. This was the Heavengazer Tower of
Radiance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent almost
every minute of every day meditating within the Heavengazer Tower, as
he knew that completely dissecting and mastering these thousands of
different sword-arts would require an incredibly long period of time.
He naturally was going to make use of the Heavengazer Tower’s time
compression abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
finished meditating on every single sculpture, and I’ve reached my
limit for now.” Ning waved his hand, putting aside the Heavengazer
Tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
boundless vigor and excitement. As he stared at the surrounding
statues, he bowed slightly and said, “Thank you, senior Allgod. If
it wasn’t for you collecting all these sword-arts, how could I, Ji
Ning, possibly have gained sudden enlightenment today?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was being quite
modest in describing himself as having ‘gained sudden
enlightenment’ today. There was nothing sudden about the hard work
he had put in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a saying on Earth
went, comparisons can be deadly. What were the strengths and
weaknesses of a sword-art? An amateur wouldn’t be able to tell just
by looking at it. Only by completely dissecting these sword-arts and
carefully comparing them to each other would you slowly discover that
while this sword-art was exceedingly profound in this area, it had
certain flaws in other areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it strong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it weak?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After dissecting all of
those sword-arts, Ning had gained certain yardsticks which he could
use to judge the qualities of various sword-arts. Slowly, he gained
an increasingly deeper level insight into the Dao of the Sword. In
fact, Ning now had a complete, systemic view of the Dao of the Sword
that belonged to him and him alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These thousands of
sword-arts could be divided up into several general categories. In
the end, Ning had divided those five thousand-plus sword-arts into
twelve primary categories. After ascertaining that his judgments were
correct, Ning suddenly felt as though wide panorama had opened up
before him. He almost felt as though no sword-arts were too
mysterious for him to understand! Even if there were some which were
so profound that he would not be able to understand them at present,
if he was given enough time he would thoroughly master it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This self-confidence
came into being after he had finished visualizing these thousands of
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me test it all
out using the [Nameless] sword-art and Violetjewel’s quintessence
core.” Ning smiled slightly. In recent years, he hadn’t spent any
time truly focusing on the [Nameless] sword-art At most, he would
just turn a small part of his attention to it when he learned
something that would be relevant for it. Despite that, he had still
long ago mastered the third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the
‘Great Firmament’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art - ‘Horizon’s End’. Quite profound,
really.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly began to
work on dissecting this sword-art, starting from the basic essence of
the sword and then slowly working up to mentally executing the
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent a total of
twelve hours on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
works. The creator of this sword-art truly was an incredible figure.
This fourth stance is far more profound than those thousands of
sword-arts I just finished analyzing.” Ning sighed softly in
amazement. Still, he knew that although those thousands of sword-arts
weren’t particularly profound in comparison, they had still served
to help broaden his horizons and let him get a deeper understanding
of the true nature of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had only taken him
twelve short hours for him to master the fourth stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stance,
then?” Ning began to meditate on the fifth stance, but a short
while later he gave it up. “Even World God Northrest himself was
only able to master the fifth stance. During the past three thousand
years, I’ve been meditating in seclusion but haven’t gained any
practical combat experience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel suddenly
appeared in Ning’s hands. “I suppose I should take a look at my
sword’s quintessence core.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully attuned
himself to the savage, murderous, yet exalted sword-intent that lay
hidden within Violetjewel’s quintessence core. In the past, it was
extremely hard for him to attune to it, but it was now noticeably
easier. It took him a full day before he felt as though he could no
longer make any further improvements or gain a better understanding
of it… but the insights he did gain were more than enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning began to
develop a new sword-stance of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stance shall be
the second stance of the [Quintessence Sword-Intent]. Since I
developed it here in the Allgod Estate, let it be named the Allgod
stance,” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Ning felt
a hint of gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it hadn’t been for
Daolord Allgod spending many chaos cycles of hard work in watching
master-class World Gods train in the Dao of the Sword, then
laboriously carve these thousands of sculptures, how could Ning have
been able to gain such tremendous enlightenment in such a short
period of time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, this was
also because Ning’s own understanding of the sword was a pure one
that guided him straight to the prime essence of the sword. There
might be many other experts of the Dao of the Sword who had more
profound insights than Ning, but when they saw these statues they
would probably say, “I have my own path already. These differ from
my Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha… I had
planned on leaving this place after becoming a World God, but I
didn’t expect that this place would be far more valuable to me than
the drop of Eternal blood.” Ning let out a heartfelt laugh. Not
only had he mastered the third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, he
had even mastered the fourth stance. The third stance was all that
was needed to become a World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These past three
thousand years had been a truly transformative period of time for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword had now truly
gained a soul of its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had established a
firm foundation for becoming a peerless expert in the Dao of the
Sword in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Time to break
through to the World level.” Ning sat down in the lotus position,
calming his heart and soul.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_6___Breakthrough__World"></A>
Chapter 6 - Breakthrough, World Level!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heavens shook and
the earth quaked as the chaos energy in the area began to oscillate
wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures suddenly
appeared in the plaza before the Castrum Divinitus. It was the bald
three-eyed man and the formation-spirit maiden. Both raised their
heads to stare deep into the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a torrent of
chaos energy.” The maiden let out a sigh. “This is causing a far
greater disturbance than is usually seen when a cultivator breaks
through to the World level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t compare
Ji Ning to ordinary World-level cultivators,” the three-eyed man
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that they were located within the Allgod Estate, but they were still
able to see the chaos energy surging violently. One could imagine how
huge the disturbance outside was! When the Flamefairy had made her
breakthrough, the disturbance had been much smaller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A breakthrough? It
must be Ji Ning of Vastheaven Palace.” The formation-spirit of the
Ten Thousand Mountains appeared at the top of a mountain peak in
white robes. He raised his head to stare at the chaos energy
pulsating through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The chaos energy
seems to be shaking quite violently.” Even though Su Youji was
located within the Castrum Divinitus, she could still sense that
something was happening. “Did someone make a breakthrough? Was it
Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Allgod
Estate. The disturbance in the rest of the chaosworld was far greater
than the disturbance within the estate itself. An utterly enormous
chaos vortex had appeared high above the chaosworld, covering the
entirety of the skies. Just looking at it would cause one’s
heartrate to speed up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a huge event.”
The blood-robed Arroyo, the gold-robed Fukai, and World God Boneplate
all raised their heads to stare coldly at the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That freak of an
Elder God must have made his breakthrough,” Fukai growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely. Good.
Now that he’s made his breakthrough, he’ll be coming out soon.”
Cold light flashed through Arroyo’s eyes. “He lives up to being
an Elder God who can battle master-class World Gods to a standstill.
Look at the size of that thing! He has to be close to being on par
with me by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Fukai
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both had extraordinary
backgrounds and were extraordinarily talented. When they had made
their breakthroughs, they had caused similarly shocking disturbances
to the local flow of chaos energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Castrum Divinitus.
Within the Hall of Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position, an endless torrent of chaos energy swirling around
him and into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his Jindan
region. This had previously been a beautiful, peaceful place, filled
with islands that floated within a sea of elemental energy. However…
everything was now being destroyed and returned to the primordial
chaos from whence they came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Jindan
region had been reduced to a region of utter chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword-seed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A seed had appeared out
of nowhere. This seed was a sword-seed that would naturally form once
one reached the fifth stage of swordforce, the ‘Sword God’ stage.
Generally speaking, it would be extremely hard to see it with the
naked eye. However, now that the entire region had been reduced to
primordial chaos it was now much more noticeable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire region of
chaos energy swirled around the sword-seed. It was the center of the
entire region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sixth stage of
swordforce - Sword World!” A voice echoed throughout this world of
chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This seed surrounded by
sword-ki began to expand and transform. It slowly began to split
open, allowing a sapling to emerge from its shell. Soon, the
sword-seed had completely transformed into a small tree that was
growing at an incredible pace. Its many branches began to furiously
extend outwards as Ning poured his insights regarding the Dao of the
Sword into it, nourishing it and allowing this tree which represented
his Dao of the Sword to grow nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tree continued to
grow at an incredible pace, becoming thirty meters tall. Three
hundred. Nine hundred. Eighteen hundred. Three thousand…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s insights into
the Dao of the Sword were simply astonishing. As a result, his
Dao-tree was growing to a similarly astonishing size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary trees allowed
the ground they were rooted in to be stable, while a Dao-tree would
allow a Chaos Immortal’s Jindan chaos region to be stable. The
presence of the Dao-tree would allow the Jindan chaos region to
continuously grow and expand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao-tree
represented a cultivator’s insights into the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s path was the
Dao of the Sword, and so this tree was a tree which represented the
Dao of the Sword! Of course, in the future Ning’s Jindan chaos
region could give birth to other Dao-trees as well, ones which
embodied the Daos of Water or Lightning. However, at present Ning
clearly was not sufficiently enlightened with regards to these Daos.
His other Daos were not at the World level yet. He might be able to
form Dao-seeds, but there was no way for them to bloom and grow into
trees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The height of a
Dao-tree represented a cultivator’s level of insights into a Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normal cultivators who
had just broken through to become World-level cultivators would
generally just have Dao-trees that were around a thousand meters
tall! Only after stabilizing their foundation would their Dao-tree
grow to become three thousand meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dao-tree of three
thousand meters meant that one had become a ‘normal’ World-level
cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dao-tree of thirty
thousand meters meant that one was comparable to elite World-level
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dao-tree of 108,000
meters meant that one had reached the level of full mastery as a
World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For World-level
cultivators, Dao-trees growing to 108,000 meters was the maximum
possible limit. No World-level cultivator’s Dao-tree could ever
grow any higher. Only if one found one’s own Dao and underwent a
fundamental transformation would this limit be breached, allowing the
Dao-tree to grow even taller and thicker. This was the level of the
Samsara Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao-tree became an
increasingly towering presence within this region of primordial
chaos, sprouting more and more leaves and branches. Every single
branch represented a different sword-art which Ning had mastered.
Because Ning had created many sword-arts of his own and had mastered
thousands of sword-arts in the Hall of Swords, his Dao-tree was
filled with leafy foliage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">15,000 meters… 24,000
meters… 30,000 meters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree continued
to grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It contained all of
Ning’s insights into the Dao of the Sword, and it clearly had an
incredible foundation. When it reached 63,000 meters, it finally came
to a halt and stopped growing taller, but its leaves and branches
continued to stretch out in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had three branches
that were particularly thick. These three boughs represented the
[Nameless] sword-art, the [Quintessence Sword-Intent], and the
[Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bough that
represented the [Nameless] sword-art emanated a boundless yet calm
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bough that
represented the [Quintessence Sword-Intent] radiated an aura of
savagery and violence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the bough which
represented the [Brightmoon] sword-art, it seemed to represent the
vastness of the void itself, making it impossible for others to fully
comprehend it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“63,000 meters? It
seems my insights into the Dao of the Sword are superior to that of
most elite World-level cultivators, but is still quite a distance
away from the level of full mastery.” Ning understood that in
cultivation, the latter stages were always the hardest ones. Still,
he wasn’t too far away from the level of full mastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My insights into the
Dao are somewhat inferior to the insights of master-class World Gods…
but no matter how profound your insights are, what really matters is
your ability to apply them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was common for two
master-class World Gods to execute sword-arts that were world’s
apart in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had mastered the
fourth stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the ‘Horizon’s Edge’,
as well as the second stance of the [Quintessence Sword-Intent], the
‘Allgod’ stance. On a technical level, he was on par with the
Starlord of Fogstone or God Emperor Blacklotus. Those two had been
roughly on par with each other in terms of technique; Blacklotus’
advantage primarily came from the fact that he had an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire chaos region
began to furiously expand, devouring more and more chaos energy from
the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this,
having a first tier, second tier, or third tier Jindan no longer made
any difference. Upon becoming a Chaos Immortal, everything would
return to the primordial chaos from whence all things arose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
most Chaos Immortals would have a chaos region of a certain
predetermined size. As their insights expanded and their Dao-tree
grew, the chaos region would naturally grow as well. Because Ning had
fused seventeen clones together, his heartforce and his Jindan
regions were qualitatively superior to that of most cultivators,
resulting in a larger chaos region. The Chaos Immortal energy he
could draw upon would also be purer than that of most cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training in a technique
that allowed one to have many different clones then merging them
together would indeed result in one becoming a significantly more
powerful cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had ‘merely’
merged seventeen clones, and so he hadn’t become too ridiculously
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Techniques like the
[Thousand Bodies Sutra] allowed for the creation of a thousand
clones. Once all those clones were merged together, one would be
enhanced to a ridiculous level. Those who had successfully trained in
the [Thousand Bodies Sutra] then broke through to become World Gods
would have bodies that were comparable to the bodies of Samsara
Daolords! This was proof of how truly incredible this technique was.
Because Ning’s own body was merely formed from seventeen different
clones, his body was merely strengthened by a single small level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
the entirety of his Jindan region had been converted into primordial
chaos. His Dao-tree was more than sixty thousand meters tall, and it
was able to stabilize the entire region. A large amount of Chaos
Immortal energy had taken form as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This feels
wonderful.” Ning could sense his soul rapidly increasing in power
thanks to it being nourished by his Chaos Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmmm. I’ve already
made my breakthrough as a Ki Refiner. Time to break through as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now at such an
incredibly high level of insight that he was able to easily sense
that every single cell in his body was filled with an urgent desire
to transform and become stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things had just started
to calm down in the outside world, and the flow of chaos energy had
finally started to stabilize. All of a sudden, the chaos energy began
to pulsate wildly once more as an enormous amount of it was drawn
into the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Arroyo,
Fukai, and Boneplate all tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he
simultaneously made his breakthrough as a Ki Refiner and as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner,” Arroyo said coldly. Ki Refiners generally
found it somewhat easier to make their breakthroughs, while Fiendgod
Body Refiners found it a bit more difficult. Arroyo himself had first
broken through to become a Chaos Immortal, then spent ten thousand
more years in training before breaking through to become a World God
as well. Ning simply had too high a level of insight into the Dao,
which was why he was able to easily break through as both a Chaos
Immortal and as a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he did?
He still has to die.” Fukai’s eyes were filled with a murderous
look. Since Ji Ning had made his breakthrough, he was sure to come
out soon.

Chapter 7 - Leaving the Castrum Divinitus
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Sword World
serving as his core, Ji Ning began to remold his divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine power began
to undergo a fundamental change, transforming him into a higher level
of existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire body
suddenly burst apart, then instantly solidified into a total of a
hundred jewels. These were jewels formed from divine power - godgems!
A flood of chaos energy surrounded these jewels, causing more and
more godgems to rapidly form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree was the
core of a Chaos Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The godgems formed the
core of a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if one
was a dual refiner one would have both types of cores.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
One godgem after another continued to coalesce. Every single godgem
had to be infused with sufficient insights regarding the Dao of the
Sword, but the insights within each jewel had to be different. Thus,
the more insights into the Dao of the Sword you had, the more godgems
you would create.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Newly ascended
cultivators who broke through would be able to generate a few hundred
godgems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators who had
stabilized their foundations would generally have a thousand godgems
and be ‘standard’ World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon gaining a total of
ten thousand godgems, one would be at the level of an elite World
God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At thirty-six thousand
gems, one would have reached full mastery as a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Ning formed
a total of exactly 21,192 godgems. This was quite comparable to the
height of his Dao-tree, and was what Ning had expected. Thanks to the
fact that he had fused seventeen clones together, the divine power
contained within his godgems was slightly purer than the divine power
‘ordinary’ World Gods had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-one thousand
godgems that were scattered throughout the area instantly began to
surge to a central location, joining together into a human figure
that had the form of a white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While I’m making
my breakthrough, I have an unlimited amount of chaos energy at my
disposal. I need to hurry up and use it to fill up my azureflower
region.” The azureflower seal appeared on Ning’s forehead as he
sent his senses into the azureflower region within his sea of
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single azure flower
was fluttering within his sea of consciousness. It now looked even
more dazzlingly beautiful than it had before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this azure
flower was the vast azureflower region. As Ning poured his divine
power and his Immortal energy into it, both were absorbed and
converted into that misty energy. The power of the mist took Ning’s
breath away; it was now unfathomably more powerful than it had been
when he had been an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the mist condensed to form a single liquid drop. Ning could now sense
a slight pressure weighing down upon his azureflower region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been an
Elder God, he had only been able to manifest a maximum of thirty-six
drops of this azureflower liquid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
I’ll be able to manifest now.” Ning continued to condense more
and more drops of azureflower liquid, pouring all of his divine power
and Immortal energy into the azureflower region as he furiously drew
upon the chaos energy of the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one was making a
breakthrough, one would have the ability to directly draw upon
virtually limitless amounts of chaos energy! The cultivator making
the breakthrough would be able to swallow as much of it as he could
handle. When he could no longer absorb any more, everything would
naturally come to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is taking so
long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can Ji Ning be
absorbing so much chaos energy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji, Dragonbinder,
the formation-spirits of the Allgod Estate, Arroyo, Fukai… all of
them were uniformly stunned at the amount of time Ji Ning was
spending in absorbing chaos energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, what they
didn’t realize was that the chaos energy was entering Ning’s body
at an unprecedented rate. He had actually absorbed far more of it
than they had imagined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">108 drops!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the new limit,
the maximum number of azureflower drops which the azureflower region
could hold. Every single drop of ‘water’ contained an utterly
overwhelming amount of energy; Ning had to use up nearly his entire
reserve of divine power and Immortal energy in order to create a
single drop. In other words, the amount of energy the azureflower
region had just absorbed was a hundred times as much energy Ning
would’ve ‘normally’ absorbed after breaking through to become a
World-level cultivator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were some cultivators who deliberately slowed down the energy
absorption process when they made their breakthroughs, so as to get a
better feeling for the overall process. Thus, while Ji Ning was
furiously absorbing as much chaos energy as he could, Su Youji and
the others all merely thought that he was just taking a long time.
They didn’t truly understand how much chaos energy he had sucked
in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This feeling…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there within
the Hall of Swords, a stunned look on his face. He lightly balled his
fist together. BOOM! He could sense that he had enough power in his
fingers to effortlessly crush a chaos star to pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is ridiculous.
How can this azureflower mist energy be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had merged
seventeen of the clones created by the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods].
Now that he had broken through become a World God, he had the power
of a half-step Daolord. And yet, when Ning activated the power of the
azureflower mist energy his body underwent an utterly earthshaking
transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the power of the
azureflower mist energy filled his body, his body greedily drank it
all in like a parched land drinking in the rain after a long drought.
The azureflower mist energy filled him with vitality and life energy,
giving his entire body such a terrifying amount of strength that Ning
himself was frightened by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With the azureflower
mist energy reinforcing my body, I should be as fast as a Samsara
Daolord,” Ning mused. “Where did these Nine Chaos Seals come
from? They are ridiculously powerful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique was not
only of great benefit to Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals, it was
of just as much benefit to World-level cultivators. This technique
was simply unearthly. Someone who had mastered the [Thousand Bodies
Sutra] would have a body comparable to a newly ascended Samsara
Daolord… and Ning’s azureflower seal was just as marvelously
effective as that sutra!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Three
Purities said that he found it within the primordial chaos. It seems
that I should send my Primaltwin to wander through the primordial
chaos surrounding the Three Realms. I wonder if I can find the
original Nine Chaos Seal.” Ning had a feeling that these nine
ridiculously powerful chaos seals had to have extraordinary
backgrounds. His Primaltwin was already located in the primordial
chaos outside the Three Realms and had nothing to do. He might as
well send it out exploring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that he
made his breakthrough, his Primaltwin had also made its breakthrough.
It now was also supported and reinforced by azureflower mist energy,
giving it a level of power that was extremely close to that of Ning’s
true body. Its only weakness lay in the fact that it didn’t have an
Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t get too
cocky though. The endless primordial chaos is filled with many
mysteries. The [Thousand Bodies Sutra], the Nine Chaos Seals…
although such incredibly powerful techniques are very rare, they
still exist. I was lucky enough to acquire one but I can’t let
myself become too arrogant. As the saying goes, there’s always a
taller mountain somewhere. Daolord Allgod was someone who was capable
of slaying Eternal Emperors!” Ning quickly calmed down and quelled
his excited emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were too many
freakishly powerful figures in the endless primordial chaos. Hell,
the entire race of Aeonians actually devoured Samsara Daolords for
sustenance! As for Daolord Badlands, he was the number three
Numerancy expert of the entire Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many might
figures of simply incredible power. Ning might have a bit of power
now, but compared to them he still wasn’t qualified to behave in a
prideful, arrogant manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss. Pop. A pool of
lava bubbled and boiled, and next to it sat Su Youji. The Flamefairy
was still waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That should’ve
been Master making his breakthrough. He should be coming out soon,
right?” Su Youji was waiting eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Su Youji.” A
figure suddenly appeared, materializing directly above the lava. It
was the nearly-nude, barefoot maiden. “Come, it is time to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it Master who
made the breakthrough?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The maiden
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space twisted and
distorted around her as she was forcibly teleported away once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Everything
around her became blurred and distorted. By the time it all came back
into focus, Su Youji realized that she had returned to the great
plaza in front of the Castrum Divinitus, the one which had held the
trial of the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
immediately saw the white-robed youth who stood nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was just standing
there, a sword on his back and an mighty aura of tremendous power
radiating from his body. This was the aura of a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master!” Su Youji said delightedly, “The Allgod Estate truly was
a blessed place for the two of us. We both broke through to the World
level here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it truly was a
blessed place.” Ning couldn’t help but think back to the Hall of
Swords and its thousands of sword-arts. That place truly had been of
tremendous assistance to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
looked at the nearby formation-spirit maiden. Although the
formation-spirit didn’t have a cultivation base, it had lived for
far longer than even many Samsara Daolords had. Here within the
Allgod Estate, it could probably wipe out most Samsara Daolords with
ease. For him to respectfully address the spirit as ‘senior’ was
just proper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please send me and
Su Youji to the Grove of Monoliths within the Fog Sea,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to go
to the Fog Sea first?” The maiden was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. You might as
well go solidify your foundation in the Fog Sea, I suppose.” The
maiden nodded. “Go ahead.” After speaking, she waved a finger and
caused space to twist and distort around Ji Ning and Su Youji. It was
like a whirlpool had formed around them, swallowing them up and
causing them to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mist billowed
everywhere. This was the Fog Sea region of the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of spatial
waves suddenly rippled out from a desolate patch of land, followed by
Ji Ning and Su Youji appearing out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning could
clearly sense the ripples generated by the nearby Mirrorsnow
Painting. He couldn’t help but laugh. “That bugbeast is still
hiding within the Grove of Monoliths. It has been several thousand
years, but he remains hidden there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grove of Monoliths
was a dangerous place, but Ning no longer feared it. The main reason
he had come to the Allgod Estate was to acquire the Mirrorsnow
Painting, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You scared that
bugbeast witless, Master. If it hadn’t been for World God Foxblaze
and his friend accosting us, the bugbeast probably would’ve died
long ago. It knows we have a method to track it, so of course it is
unwilling to leave the Grove,” Su Youji said.

Chapter 8 - The Battle in the Grove of Monoliths
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go to
the Grove of Monoliths.” Ji Ning laughed as he began to walk
towards the Grove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we really going
there, Master?” Su Youji was rather worried. She had started to
grow a bit nervous as soon as she had heard Ning ask the
formation-spirit girl to teleport them straight to the Fog Sea. The
Grove was one of the truly dangerous parts of the Fog Sea, and even
supreme World Gods would only have a decent chance at best to escape
from that place alive. It truly was a deadly place to venture into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning glanced
at Su Youji, then smiled. “But you won’t be needed for this
battle. Just go into the estate-world when the battle begins. If you
stay by my side, I’ll be distracted because I would need to protect
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words were
quite simply and ordinary, but Su Youji could sense the absolute
self-confidence and the absolute dominance inherent in those words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her master had just
broken through to become a World God, yet already possessed such
incredible faith in himself?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji nodded slowly.
“Alright. I’ll listen to you, Master. I still hope that you’ll
be careful in your journey through the Grove.” She stared very
carefully at Ning as she spoke, trying to find some clues from his
aura regarding his current level of strength. Ning’s aura was that
of a World God’s, but it didn’t seem as though there had been any
other major changes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oh. One change was that
Ning seemed calmer than before. Even though he was in a dangerous
place, he seemed completely calm and unflappable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, why are you
carrying that sword on your back?” Su Youji suddenly noticed the
biggest difference. In the past, Ning would instantly materialize his
sword when entering combat. He never kept it on his back before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m training,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Training?” Su
Youji was puzzled. How could carrying a sword on your back be
considered training? Still, she didn’t ask any more questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was carrying the
Eternal weapon ‘Violetjewel’ on his back. By staying in contact
with it at all times, he was able to better familiarize himself and
attune himself to the quintessence sword-intent hidden within the
sword’s core at all times. He was attuned to it every day and every
night
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that if a mortal carried a blade with him at all times to the point
of holding it when sleeping, that mortal would also be able to
develop an extremely terrifying saber-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Habits such as this
were quite important. Ning wanted to be attuned to the quintessence
sword-intent at all times, as this would allow him to comprehend it
more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Violetjewel
was the strongest weapon which Ning had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art, ‘Horizon’s Edge’, was on the same
level as the second stance of the [Quintessence Sword-Intent], the
‘Allgod’ stance. If Ning used a different sword to execute these
two stances, they would be on par with each other in power. However,
because the Allgod stance was developed based on the quintessence
sword-intent within Violetjewel, it would be much stronger when Ning
actually used Violetjewel and its quintessence core. When Ning used
Violetjewel to execute the two stances the difference was actually
quite great, with the Allgod stance capable of unleashing several
times as much power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be able
to protect yourself on your path of cultivation. Otherwise, you’ll
die an early death. I’ve now gained insight into both the
[Nameless] sword-art and the [Quintessence Sword-Intent]. For now, I
should favor the [Quintessence Sword-Intent]. It will let me unleash
greater power in battle for now.” Although Ning was able to
estimate how strong he had become, he didn’t know exactly how
strong that was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only through battle
would he be able to truly ascertain how strong he had grown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grove of
Monoliths…” Ning stared towards a distant, fog-shrouded monolith
that had been planted into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay prepared. Have
Blacksun and Wilddog do the same. All three of you should be ready to
be summoned by me at a moment’s notice,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master. Be
careful, Master.” Su Youji had a worried look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled, then
waved his hand and collected her into his estate-world. He then
turned and headed off by himself towards the Grove of Monoliths, a
small smile playing on his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enormous monoliths were
planted throughout the Grove of Monoliths, with tens thousand of them
having been planted in total. Quite a few of them had powerful
bugbeasts coiling atop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
strolled into the Grove as though he was entering his own private
garden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An avian beast with
bright red claws was currently coiled around the top of a giant
monolith that was a few hundred kilometers away from Ning. The
creature’s eyes were shut in slumber, and every so often a few
streams of fire would flick out from its nostrils as it exhaled, with
the streams of fire swirling around an area of a hundred meters. As
Ning moved towards the creature, he could sense it open its eyes. Its
two eyes were filled with a cold, murderous look in them as it stared
at the human cultivator who had trespassed on its territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Outsider…”
The flying beast let out a low growl. “Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its black wings
suddenly spread out as it shot forth like a dazzling streak of
electric light, moving far faster than the limits of the Heavenly
Daos. This avian creature was actually quite formidable, far more so
than the crocodilian creature Ning had fought and pursued for the
sword-ki painting. This creature had the power of an elite World God,
giving it tremendous confidence in its abilities to deal with most
Outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if it encountered
someone stronger than it, it felt that it would at most be slightly
suppressed. Once the battle went on for an extended period of time,
other bugbeasts would soon begin to arrive. By then, the Outsider
cultivator would have to choose between fleeing or dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KREE.” An ugly
screeching sound rang out from the winged creature’s mouth as its
enormous bright red claws ripped towards Ning. As for its black
wings, it swept them towards Ning’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
forward in a very calm manner. Why wouldn’t he be calm? Even when
he was an Elder God, he wouldn’t have feared a bugbeast like this,
much less now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Spatial ripples spread out from those giant claws as they tore
through the air and struck with power comparable to that of Rocky’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s arms suddenly
stretched out to become many dozens of meters long, and his fingers
chopped out like the edges of a sharp blade. He used his hand to stab
directly into the avian creature’s brain, then pulled his hand
back. A huge hole had appeared in the avian beast’s head, with the
insides of its skull completely destroyed. Life fled from its eyes
and it died on the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although bugbeasts were
born and bred for combat and possessed incredibly powerful bodies,
they had their own weak spots as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dull look of
amazement could still be seen in the creature’s now-lifeless eyes
as its corpse fell from the skies, kicking up a storm of dust as it
slammed into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave it a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Horizon’s Edge.
This truly is a formidable technique created by an ancient power. It
really is formidable!” Ning couldn’t help but mentally praise the
technique. Just now, he had used his fingers to simulate the strikes
of a sword. Because of his Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand],
his two hands were now comparable to Dao weapons. Bugbeasts like
these weren’t worthy of him drawing his true weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Horizon’s Edge
technique could be summarized in one word - fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the sword
struck, it would instantly be able to reach the very edges of the
horizon! This is what was meant by the name, ‘Horizon’s Edge’.
Ji Ning had simply struck out with his right hand, but the avian
beast was given no chance to dodge or block whatsoever. The
azureflower mist energy had given Ning incredible speed and power to
begin with, and when he matched it with the Horizon’s Edge
technique, he was able to strike even faster. Even bugbeasts with
incredibly powerful bodies such as the avian creature would be unable
to dodge it in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AROOOO!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWRAAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL THE INVADER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL THE OUTSIDER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ripples generated
by this sudden battle quickly spread out to cover the entire ten
thousand kilometers of the Grove of Monoliths, causing the bugbeasts
all began to furiously converge upon this location. This was the most
terrifying aspect of the Grove! Formidable World-level cultivators
could deal with these bugbeasts one or two at a time, but when they
surrounded you and converged upon you in such a manner, you would
have no choice but to flee even if you had the power of a supreme
World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. I’ll
use you all to test myself out and see how powerful I have become.”
Ning continued to stroll forwards, moving towards the direction of
the crocodilian beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more bugbeasts
began to appear within his field of vision. Some had enormous scaled
wings, some crawled through the ground like centipedes, some were
plant-type creatures with green leaves, while some looked almost
humanoid and jogged across the land. All of them had auras of
incredible power, but none of them were in a rush to immediately
charge towards Ning. Instead, they continued to gather in number in
the area around him. Ten of them. Twenty of them. Thirty of them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They circled around
Ning but didn’t attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How crafty. Even
though bugbeasts are stupid creatures, the ones who can survive to
reach the World level are all quite crafty.” Ning chuckled as he
glanced at the thirty-plus bugbeasts who had already arrived. All of
these powerful creatures were staring intently at Ning, who remained
as placid as a calm pool of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, they moved. A
total of thirty-nine bugbeasts had arrived by now, and one of them
was a towering humanoid bugbeast whose entire body was covered with
sharp spikes. As it let out a furious howl, the other thirty-eight
bugbeasts instantly began to charge straight for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
without moving, allowing these thirty-nine bugbeasts to attack him en
masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning
stretched his hand out. His palms transformed in size, looking almost
like utterly enormous palm-leaf fans that were filled with enough
power to easily crush any chaosworld to bits. When he struck out with
these titanic palms, the very skies themselves seemed to grow dim. At
Ning’s current level of mastery, every single strike was filled
with inconceivably profound mysteries and insights. He sent a palm
smashing towards the head of the first creature to arrive, a
fast-moving four-legged unicorn-like beast. BOOM! The four-legged
unicorn’s head caved in so deep that it was pressed down through
the neck into its chest. It died on the spot.

Chapter 9 - We Meet Again
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many bugbeasts
began to swarm around Ji Ning. Some blasted streaks of energy from
their mouths, while the bugbeast that was covered with green leaves
suddenly sprouted many branches as it charged into close combat
range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that during the trial of the Samsara Grinders, only master-class
World Gods were capable of successfully fighting those many weak (but
berserk) World-level golden warriors to a standstill. These
bugbeasts, however, were far stronger than those golden warriors had
been, with a small number actually being comparable to master-class
World Gods themselves. One bad strike could knock you to the ground,
and you would instantly be entangled by vines, branches, tails, and
other flexible weapons. After that happened, you would be dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cruel shadow suddenly
streaked out. Ning’s fingers had pierced straight through the skull
of a centipede-like bugbeast! The strike was simply too fast. As soon
as Ning’s fingers had moved, they had gone straight through the
enemy’s defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s palms suddenly
expanded to become enormous in size, and he furiously chopped down
with the edge of his palm like a hatchet! The power of his blow
smashed an airborne winged bugbeast directly into the ground, its
body shattering apart into countless pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s hands looked
almost crystalline as they transformed into streaks of blade-light
that lashed out, chopping straight through the head of the savage,
humanoid-shaped creature that was completely covered with spikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a massacre.
Ning’s two hands were weapons of mass destruction, and the more he
killed the more excited he became. He suddenly manifested the [Three
Heads, Six Arms] technique and began to slaughter any bugbeasts who
dared to move close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been having a
wonderful nap for the past chaos cycle. Why has it taken all of you
so long to deal with this invader? Why is he still not dead?” A
turtle-shaped bugbeast slowly flew towards Ning from afar, but
moments later it came to a sudden halt as its beady little eyes
widened. It could see that there were now more than eighty bugbeasts
gathered in the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area was littered
with shattered corpses. Normally, bugbeasts loved to devour the
corpses of other bugbeasts, but right now no one was even thinking of
doing such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had been
terrified by the slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than fifty
bugbeasts had been slain, and that white-robed sword-bearing youth
continued to hold the complete upper hand in the battle as he
continued to slay even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the first
bugbeast broke ranks and began to flee. Instantly, the teetering
morale of the remaining bugbeasts shattered. They had only dared to
continue the fight because of so many others being present, but they
now lost all their courage and began to flee in every which way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s freaking
terrifying. He killed more than half of them!” The turtle was so
frightened that he immediately turned tail and fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” Ning
suddenly transformed into a shadowy blur, his speed reaching
incredible heights as his six arms savagely struck out in every
direction. In the blink of an eye, more than ten more bugbeasts fell
to the ground, dead. In the end, only eight of the bugbeasts that had
surrounded Ning were lucky enough to escape with their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That had felt good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had utterly
dominated them and massacred them, in the process getting a better
understanding of his current level of power. During the trial of the
Samsara Grinders, he had been able to easily defeat those
golden-armored warriors, and he was now able to slaughter these
bugbeasts with a similar degree of ease, including those master-class
ones. They were like infants before him, easily slain by a casual
blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This level of power
completely and vastly surpassed that of a ‘supreme’ World God’s.
Even if God Emperor Blacklotus came back to life, Ning would be able
to easily defeat and slay him without even using Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone kept on
talking about how strong those bugbeasts are, but I’m much stronger
than them. Even if I completely rely on raw brute force alone, I’ve
reached the Samsara Daolord threshold of power. My sword-arts,
however, can allow me to better unleash my true power.” The reason
why Ning was able to butcher these bugbeasts so easily was because he
had the azureflower mist energy strengthening him as well as a
terrifyingly strong divine body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arroyo made certain
breakthroughs on the Samsara Grinder and is now a transcendent World
God. He probably has just barely reached the Samsara Daolord
threshold of power as well. However, he can only reach that level
when he unleashes his complete, full power in his strikes. Any random
blow I unleash when using [Three Heads, Six Arms] is probably
somewhat stronger than his full-force blows. If I was to use my
Eternal weapon, Violetjewel… I think the power of my strikes would
be enough to threaten even actual Samsara Daolords,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he would only
be able to threaten a Samsara Daolord who had just recently made his
breakthrough. True Samsara Daolords who had been Fiendgod Body
Refiners would have divine bodies that were just as strong as Ning’s,
and they would generally have both Eternal weapons and more profound
insights into the Dao! Given that they had other secret arts and
divine abilities of their own… Ning was still some distance away
from being able to battle them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was an
indisputable fact that if Ning struck out with his sword, even
Samsara Daolords would have to take his strike seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining bugbeasts
in the Grove began to disperse and flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he could
sense where the crocodilian creature was and the direction it was
fleeing towards. Ning quickly advanced towards its direction, and on
the way he was able to see quite a few magic treasures and weapons
scattered throughout the grove. These were the spoils of war which
the bugbeasts had taken from cultivators they had slain! Ning went
ahead and collected them as he advanced through the Grove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That crocodile is
still fleeing?” Ning’s speed suddenly skyrocketed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His speed instantly
reached a terrifying new level as he blasted through the skies above
the Grove. He almost instantly caught up with the blindly fleeing
crocodilian bugbeast, which had been fleeing at its own top speed.
“Who the hell was that invader, and why is he so strong? Everyone
else is fleeing, so I guess I should flee as well. Right, right.”
The crocodilian bugbeast hadn’t taken part in the fight, but it had
began to flee when the other creatures had fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning suddenly
appeared directly in front of the crocodile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crocodile came to a
halt, shocked. It stared in utter terror at the white-robed youth who
had just appeared in front of him. It recognized this youth! Years
ago, this youth had pursued him so tightly that he had nowhere else
to flee but the Grove. However, back then the youth’s aura had been
fairly weak; he had merely been an Elder God at that time. His aura
was now much more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He chased me through
the Grove. Is he the one who wrecked it?” The crocodilian bugbeast
was utterly terrified. Bugbeasts were sentient creatures and thus
were capable of fear. Even in the Grove, it had merely been one of
the weaker creatures present. How could it dare to battle against
Ning now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me, spare me!”
As soon as Ning appeared before the creature, it hurriedly called out
for mercy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. He wasn’t
in a hurry to attack. “It knows to ask for mercy at a time like
this? Interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
that Ning had encountered a bugbeast which begged for mercy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over your
treasures,” Ning instructed. “If you hold back so much as a
single item… don’t blame me for not having given you a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-yes!” The
crocodile’s entire body transformed into a stream of gray mist, and
one treasure after another began to fly out of that misty region. Dao
weapons, strange claws, scales, a scroll, Chaos treasures… a small
pile of treasures appeared next to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything I have is
right here. I didn’t hold anything back.” The crocodile reformed
and hurriedly spoke to Ning in an ingratiating manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
The claws and those scales were the spoils of war the crocodilian
creature had acquired from defeating other bugbeasts. Ning didn’t
really care about them. However, that scroll emanated an aura of
sword-ki that was particularly striking, and the fact that it was
resonating with his own Mirrorsnow Painting told Ning that it had to
be the item he was looking for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
pulling the scroll over towards himself. He opened up the scroll to
take a look. It was the painting of a palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Man, these paintings
really are ugly,” Ning muttered to himself, but he had a smile on
his face. He put the painting away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four paintings in
each set. I now have the first and the third paintings in this set.”
Ning turned away and flew back towards the Grove of Monoliths. The
crocodilian creature nervously watched as Ning left before it
frantically turned to flee once more, its four stubby legs moving
furiously as it once more transformed into a streak of mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had slain most of
the bugbeasts in the Grove of Monoliths, and quite a few of them were
in possession of valuable treasures they had acquired as spoils of
war. Ning naturally was planning to collect it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six days later, Ning
emerged from the Fog Sea and returned to the Ten Thousand Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to
leave.” Ning turned back to glance at the fog, sighing mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still remembered
quite clearly the scene of him entering Undermoon Lake for the first
time. Back then, Ning had merely been an Empyrean God and had viewed
World God Northrest as a figure of utterly overwhelming power. Now,
Ning was at an even higher level of power than World God Northrest
had ever reached. There were very, very few individuals below the
Samsara Daolord level of power who were a match for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m still far
from being strong enough to reverse the flow of spacetime and bring
her back to life.” Ning shook his head, then walked out of the
mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clouds were drifting
high up in the skies. The blood-robed Arroyo, the gold-robed Fukai,
and World God Boneplate were silently seated atop the clouds,
continuously scanning this entire chaosworld with their godsense.
They had completely suppressed their auras, and they looked like
three hungry wolves who were preparing to pounce upon their prey. For
now, their claws and their fangs remained hidden as they continued to
quietly wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were waiting for
Ji Ning to emerge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, there was a
spatial ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo, Fukai, and
Boneplate simultaneously turned to look towards a direction off in
the distance. Even though they were millions of kilometers away, they
were capable of seeing with great clarity a white-robed youth who had
a sword on his back materialize in the air above the Allgod Estate.
It was that freak of an Elder God whom they had been awaiting for so
long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning could
sense their godsense and so he spread his own godsense out as well.
As he did so, he also turned to look in their direction, and he
immediately saw those three distant figures seated in the lotus
position above the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that moment, their
gazes intersected in midair!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three mighty World
Gods flew through the air like three meteors, moving straight for Ji
Ning at high speed. Although they were millions of kilometers away,
they were able to arrive right next to Ning in a single breath’s
worth of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bold.” Arroyo
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You seem quite
confident.” Fukai’s eyes were narrowed as he stared in a cold,
weighing manner at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for World God
Boneplate, he quietly stood next to Arroyo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself had
reached the speed of a Samsara Daolord. Ning could tell at a glance
that although these three were quite fast, he would be able to easily
shake off any pursuit by them without even needing to use his
Thunderlight Wings. Although the surrounding space had been locked
down, preventing any teleportation, Ning’s speed alone ensured that
he could attack whenever he wished and leave whenever he wished. The
initiative was with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo and Fukai never
would’ve imagined that Ji Ning would vastly surpass them in speed
as soon as he became a World God. For now, they were both filled with
tremendous confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the
Eternal blood,” Arroyo said. “We’re willing to trade treasures
for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai stared intently
at Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was part of their
agreed-upon plan. They wanted to first try and get Ji Ning to
voluntarily hand over the Eternal blood. If they were able to acquire
it by simply buying it from him instead of fighting for it, that
would be ideal. They had many treasures and they didn’t fear anyone
below the Samsara Daolord level, but they weren’t completely
confident that they would be able to slay Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning completely
focused on escaping… Arroyo and Fukai weren’t certain if they
would be able to catch him and bar his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course… if Ji
Ning was unwilling to hand the blood over, the only option would be
to kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are willing to
use treasures to trade for the Eternal blood?” Ning swept them with
his gaze. “And what do you have to offer?” Ning couldn’t even
be bothered to deny he had the blood. No one here was an idiot, after
all. They all knew the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have treasures
that are worth tens of thousands of cubes of chaos nectar. We’re
willing to use it to trade for your Eternal blood. You should be
satisfied by this price.” Fukai frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah… how
generous!” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are forcing us
to fight.” The killing intent within Arroyo’s eyes began to
strengthen. In the end, they were still just World-level cultivators.
Although they had many treasures, for them to be able to produce tens
of thousands of cubes worth was already quite impressive. What, were
they supposed to hand over their Eternal weapons as well? Only a fool
would be willing to hand over his trump card treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap, you
running dogs of the Aeonians.” Ning’s face turned cold as he
snapped at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of both Fukai
and Arroyo tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the running
dog of the Aeonians!” Arroyo immediately snapped back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, we’re
members of the Aeonians just because we want the Eternal blood?”
Fukai laughed coldly. “Not even the formation-spirit of the Allgod
Estate would dare to claim that we are Aeonians. You, however, are
quite audacious. How dare you sully us with such wild rumors!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither of them would
admit it, not even if it cost them their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Aeonians were all
at least at the Samsara Daolord level of power, and they had auras
that were completely different from the auras of normal Samsara
Daolords. They could be recognized at a glance. However, the
descendants and progeny of true Aeonians looked just like ordinary
cultivators did. So long as they were not Awakened, there was no way
to recognize them and there was nothing special about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aeonians were mortal
enemies of the Dao Alliance! Thus, any Aeonian slave who dared enter
the territory of the Dao alliance would immediately be surrounded and
attacked by all parties, once it was verified that they were indeed
servants of the Aeonians. They were the common enemies of all
cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Allgod,
he absolutely detested the Aeonians. If the members of the Allgod
Estate felt certain that Arroyo and Fukai were Aeonians, the Goldeye
Golem and the other formation-spirits would’ve immediately attacked
them and killed them. However, because there was no way to prove it,
they had to follow the instructions left behind by Daolord Allgod
prior to his death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us were
simply coerced by others to acquire this Eternal blood, that’s
all.” Arroyo said coldly, “Hurry up and hand the Eternal blood
over. Otherwise, today will be the day you die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Will it?”
Light suddenly flashed from Ning’s hands as sharp, icy sword swords
suddenly appeared within them. This was a set of Dao weapons which
Ning had acquired from the Grove of Monoliths, and it was one of the
many Dao weapons he had plundered from that place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This set of Dao weapons
included six swords in total, each of which was a top-grade Dao
weapon. They were incredibly sharp and perfectly suited for
cultivators of the Dao of Water. These swords all seemed to be
created from freezing cold ice, and thus Ning had decided to simply
name them the ‘Frostice Swords’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning believed that the
six Frostice Swords were most likely weapons that had belonged to
World-level cultivators. Of the Dao weapons Ning had found within the
Grove, these six swords were the treasures which Ning liked the most.
Not just anyone would be worthy of forcing Ning to use his Eternal
weapon, after all. On the other hand, Ning wasn’t arrogant enough
to try to fight Arroyo and Fukai barehanded either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Arroyo and
Fukai instantly turned cold and forbidding as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” A fierce
light flashed through Arroyo’s eyes as a total of eighteen golden
golems appeared around him, each of which emanated with an aura of
incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!” Arroyo
roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen golden
golems suddenly transformed into a giant black-and-white tornado that
moved incredibly fast as it charged towards Ning. The gigantic
black-and-white tornado began to cause all sorts of strange phenomena
in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There were actually
eighteen of them?” Ning was rather startled, as Arroyo had merely
used nine of the golems when he was fighting in the Samsara Grinders.
Now, it appeared obvious that Arroyo had been limited by the rules of
the trials back then. There were actually eighteen golems in total,
nine of them Yang-aligned and nine of them Yin-aligned. When they
joined together, they were able to cause tremendous disruptions to
the surrounding fabric of space. In addition, each golem had the
power of a master-class World God. Upon joining together into a
formation, they were strengthened and would each have close to the
power of a supreme World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When all eighteen of
them fought together, they would be able to easily kill most supreme
World Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father bestowed this
set of Hellwind Golems upon me. They are invincible against anyone
below the Samsara Daolord level of power. Even though I’ve broken
through to transcend past the supreme World God level of power, I’d
still find it quite hard to battle these Hellwind Golems.” Arroyo
was extremely confident in his golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!” Fukai
suddenly shouted loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Arroyo
turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had manifested six
arms and was wielding six of those Frostice Swords. He transformed
into a white blur and was able to easily charge out of the
encirclement of those eighteen golden golems, then charged straight
towards Arroyo who was located the closest to him. In doing so, he
clashed with two of the golems and actually knocked both of them
flying backwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
filled with an utterly terrifying sword-intent and killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo held those two
enormous scimitars in his hands, a dark look on his face. “What
marvelous sword-arts.” He had to admit that in terms of intricacy,
his saber-arts were inferior to Ji Ning’s sword-arts. Still, it
made sense. Swords were more nimble and agile weapons than sabers to
begin with. Sabers were weapons that focused on dominance and raw
power. They were two completely different weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was still
completely confident in his saber-arts. Those saber-arts had allowed
him to transcend past the supreme World God level of power, after
all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” As Ning
charged towards him, Arroyo suddenly chopped out with both of his
enormous scimitars, unleashing two streaks of blade-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two criss-crossing
streaks of blood-red light appeared in the air, filled with auras of
absolute dominance. They hacked straight towards Ning with an aura of
simply terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soleheart stance.”
A black hole suddenly appeared in the skies, and both of those two
terrifying streaks of saber-light were drawn into the black hole, the
power of the black hole completely dispersing the two attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was simply too
strong now. His sword-arts were clearly inferior to his foe’s
saber-arts, and Ning was clearly using just Dao weapons while his foe
was wielding a pair of Eternal weapons, but Ning had the benefit of
possessing as much physical strength as ordinary Samsara Daolords
did. This was what allowed Ning’s Soleheart stance to take these
two streaks of saber-light head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning borrowed
momentum from the shockwave of the clashing attacks, shooting
straight towards World God Boneplate who was standing quite close to
Arroyo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!” Arroyo’s
face tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning was
already quite freakishly strong as an Elder God, Arroyo truly had not
imagined that Ning would become THIS powerful as soon as he became a
World God. Just like that, the freak of an Elder God had become a
transcendent World God as well? Alas, it seemed as though this newly
ascended World God was indeed just as powerful as Arroyo himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their original
plans, World God Boneplate actually served a special purpose.
However, given how powerful Ji Ning actually was, World God Boneplate
was now of limited use in this battle. The problem was that
everything had simply happened far too quickly. World God Boneplate
simply didn’t have a chance to hide, and Ning’s own speed was far
faster than Boneplate’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” World God
Boneplate was badly shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
flashed as it pierced through the skies and pierced through
Boneplate’s forehead. Ning yanked his sword downwards, causing
World God Boneplate’s body to bisected into two halves. Despite
that, Boneplate hadn’t died yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here.” A
rope suddenly appeared out of nowhere and twisted itself around
Boneplate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was actually quite
surprised by what had just happened. He mused silently to himself,
“He didn’t even have a suit of Dao armor? His protective divine
ability was quite weak as well.” Ning actually hadn’t expect his
strike to go straight through the man’s body. If the man had been
wearing a suit of Dao armor or had learned a half-decent protective
divine ability, not even someone as strong as Ning wouldn’t been
able to slice through his body with such ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Arroyo had quite
a few servant and Boneplate was one of the weaker ones. Thus, he
wasn’t given access to many decent treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit.” A look of
fury could be seen on Arroyo’s face. Although Boneplate was
originally one of his weaker slaves, right now he was his only
remaining slave.

Chapter 11 - When He’s Ill, Go For the Kill!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was enraged, but
Fukai was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was quite
powerful. When he exchanged blows against Ji Ning, the difference in
power between the two wasn’t that great. However, Fukai was merely
a supreme World God and was much weaker by comparison. A shocked,
angry look was now on Fukai’s face. “How could this be happening?
How could this freak of an Elder God be so powerful after breaking
through to the World level? It appears as though even Arroyo is
slightly inferior to him! Those eighteen Hellwind Golems aren’t
able to stop him at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Fukai
immediately produced his jade green globe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One tiny jade green
globe after another began to fly out of the first one. As they flew
out, they quickly increased in size and began to release enormous,
powerful bugbeasts. These bugbeasts all had auras of tremendous might
and had the power of master-class World Gods. More than fifty of the
bugbeasts appeared in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ning was rather
surprised upon seeing this. “What a fellow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was a tough
cookie. Apparently Fukai was no pushover either! It must be
understood that although the Grove of Monoliths had held over a
hundred bugbeasts, the number that had truly reached the master class
could be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, over fifty such
master-class World God bugbeasts had appeared before Ning. Even
supreme World Gods would be forced to flee or perish before such an
onslaught of bugbeasts. Most likely, even Arroyo would be put into a
very tough situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On one side, we have
a eighteen golems that are part of a set. On the other side, we have
over fifty bugbeasts that are master-class World Gods in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly grinned.
“Excellent. What fine treasures for the picking.” Ning wasn’t
worried in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai pointed at Ning
from afar and howled angrily, “Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiring army
of bugbeasts charged towards Ning at the same time, their auras
blasting outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the eighteen
Hellwind Golems, they surrounded Ning and furiously began to assault
him once more. A look of delight appeared on Arroyo’s face when he
saw this. “Fukai finally pulled out his bugbeasts. When they work
together alongside my golems, they should be more than strong enough
to trap this freak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai’s father was a
member of the Aeonian Kingdom who specialized in rearing bugbeasts
for them. Arroyo’s father was also an Aeonian, but his skill lay in
the art of golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai and Arroyo were
both considered Aeonian descendants. In fact, both were two of the
most outstanding descendants of the Aeonian race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood,
however, that the price to forcibly Awaken any descendant of the
Aeonian race was a staggering high one, so high that not even the
Aeonian Kingdom could pay it with impunity. This was why they
repeatedly sent their descendants to take on these danger-filled
challenges!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sets parents would
do everything they could to ensure that their progeny would win the
chance to be Awakened, and thus they had each prepared special killer
weapons as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai’s killer weapon
was his horde of bugbeasts. Arroyo’s killer weapon was his powerful
formation of Hellwind Golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That really is a lot
of bugbeasts.” A pair of wings suddenly appeared on Ning’s back,
flashing with electric light. It was the Thunderlight Wings! Ning’s
insights into the Dao of Lightning were now higher than before, with
his insights into the Dao of the Sword having improved even more
dramatically. As soon as he activated his wings they allowed him to
stab through the air like a sharp sword, moving much faster than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was already quite
fast to begin with. Now, he was being assisted by the Thunderlight
Wings! He left behind a beautiful, solitary streak of light in the
skies as he easily evaded both the fifty-five bugbeasts as well as
the nearby Hellwind Golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then… he charged
straight towards Fukai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Fukai’s
face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is he this
fast?” The smile froze on Arroyo’s face as he saw this. Ji Ning
was too fast, far faster than the two had imagined! It must be
understood that although these bugbeasts had the power of
master-class World Gods, they were quite lacking in terms of
technique. They had incredibly powerful bodies, and a number of
incredibly fast avian bugbeasts were amongst their ranks, but Ji Ning
was even faster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Ning’s
raw speed and strength were both comparable to that of newly ascended
Samsara Daolords! This was a completely different level of power. Now
that he had activated the Thunderlight Wings, the Hellwind Golems and
the bugbeasts were only able to stare in a daze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they couldn’t keep
up with him, there was nothing they could do to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Fukai!”
Arroyo sent frantically. Although they had started out as rivals, Ji
Ning was simply too formidable a foe. If Fukai died, his bugbeasts
would lose their master. In fact, it was entirely possible that both
they and the jade green globe would fall into Ji Ning’s hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Fukai willed
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three more bugbeasts
appeared. These three bugbeasts were all incredibly muscular and
covered with golden fur. Fukai then produced a metallic plate that
was covered with many golden runes. He poured his Immortal energy
into this Dao-seal, activating it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A globe of golden light
that was thirty meters long suddenly appeared, covering Fukai within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!” Fukai
ordered his three bugbeasts, then turned tail and began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three bugbeasts
were almost instantly knocked flying as a streak of lightning snaked
past them towards the fleeing Fukai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ning had
actively dodged past the many bugbeasts and golems. However, since
there were now just three bugbeasts Ning didn’t even want to bother
avoiding them. In fact, if he wanted to he could’ve quickly killed
all three of them. As Ning saw it, however, if he could kill Fukai
and seize the jade green globe then all of these bugbeasts would fall
under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be owning
these bugbeasts shortly. I can’t bear to kill them.” Ning was
clearly filled with confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too fast.”
Although Fukai was fleeing in terror towards Arroyo’s direction,
Ning was quickly able to catch up to him. Fukai turned his head to
look back at Ning, a horrified look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
came hammering down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Quintessence
Sword-Intent], second stance - Allgod stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod stance and
the Horizon’s End were attacks of equal power when Ning was using
other weapons. Only when Ning used Violetjewel was there a
significant difference in power between the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Horizon’s Edge
technique focused on speed. As for the Allgod stance, it focused on
explosive and furious power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though an
enraged dreadwyrm had appeared in the skies, slamming down with
tremendous, earth-rending force towards the golden globe of light
around Fukai. The golden globe of light shuddered and turned slightly
dimmer, but Fukai was able to borrow from the momentum of the strike
to flee even more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t able to
break through?” Ning frowned slightly when he saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! He was able
to consume 20% of the power of my Dao-seal with just one blow?”
Fukai shuddered in his heart. “My Dao-seal is capable of
withstanding a full-strength blow from a Samsara Daolord, yet a newly
ascended World God was actually able to destroy 20% of its energy
with one strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Fukai was fleeing in
terror, Arroyo was flying straight towards him. “Leave him to me.
Use your bugbeasts to help me tie this freak down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Fukai
understood that they had to work together in perfect unison if they
wanted to kill this terrifying freak. Given how fast Ji Ning was, if
he wanted to flee he would’ve fled long ago. Clearly, he felt
absolute confident in his chances to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as the
many bugbeasts and golems surged towards him. As for Arroyo, he
charged straight towards Ning with both giant scimitars held at the
ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That all you have?”
Ning manifested [Three Heads, Six Arms], wielding a sword in each of
his six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every streak of
sword-light that shot out was filled with terrifying levels of power
and moved at incredible speed. Arroyo was immediately driven to the
defensive. He did his best to block the attacks with his two
scimitars, but he still forced into a rather ungainly position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that every single sword-strike Ning delivered was slightly stronger
than Arroyo’s strikes. The thing was, Ning had six swords while
Arroyo merely had two scimitars. As the saying goes, it is hard for
two fists to defend against six hands! Arroyo found it extremely hard
to defend against the attacks, and his saber-light continuously
surrounded him as he completely focused on defending against the
oncoming streaks of sword-light. He wasn’t able to fight back at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, quick,
quick!” Arroyo frantically ordered his Hellwind Golems to hurry up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move faster, Fukai!”
Arroyo was yelling at Fukai as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly had begun to
panic. As the saying went, if you focused exclusively on defense you
would eventually lose. He felt as though he was walking on a
tightrope, treading the fine line between life and death. Ning’s
swords were simply too fast, and Arroyo felt as though he might slip
up and fail at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just before the
Hellwind Golems and the bugbeasts arrived, Ning finally managed to
land a streak of sword-light against Arroyo’s waist. Arroyo
instantly turned pale as he was knocked backwards by the force of
that blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! As
the saying went, when he’s ill, go for the kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When experts fought,
victory or defeat could be determined by the slightest of things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning already held the
upper hand to begin with, and he was so fast that his foes wouldn’t
have any chance to recover from any mistakes. He sent out several
furious sword-strikes on succession, each one landing directly
against Arroyo. Arroyo was like a moth that had been swept into the
raging waves of the sea, completely unable to resist whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-n-no…!” Arroyo
furiously did his best to fight back, but his two scimitars had been
completely suppressed to the point that he wasn’t even able to chop
out with them. Just at this moment, a black serpent suddenly
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking in a
duel of experts, when one person was at a disadvantage that person
would immediately flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo wasn’t as fast
as Ning. There was no way he would be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black rope quickly
slithered forward like a viper, wrapping itself around Arroyo’s
body. It quickly bound Arroyo up tightly, causing a look of despair
to appear on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was finished!
</P>

Chapter 12 - The Curtain Call
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the ropes tightened
around Arroyo’s body, he couldn’t help but think back to his life
within that cold, grim, ancient clan of his. His father had been a
remote and exalted figure. All of his father’s descendants had to
work hard to cultivate and fight for everything they wanted! Arroyo
himself had started off as just one of many weak descendants, but he
had carved out a path all his own through the corpses of the others
and eventually became a master-class World God. He became his
father’s most cherished child! But even in his dreams, Arroyo’s
truest desire was to become a real member of the Aeonian race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” Arroyo
stared forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
was standing in the air in front of him, his main sword still slung
over his back. The youth produced a small golden gourd. Whoosh! A
powerful sucking force was applied to Arroyo’s body, and he wasn’t
able to fight back against it at all due to the ropes that were
binding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He was sucked
straight into the gourd. Once he entered the gourd, the ropes
automatically released him and flew back out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No! I can’t
accept this. I can’t!” Arroyo stared at his surroundings. There
were a pair of spinning maelstroms within this gourd, one of black
energy and the other of golden energy. As soon as Arroyo appeared,
both maelstroms instantly exploded with terrifying levels of power as
both began to grind towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grind, grind, grind.
The terrifying grinding power filled every inch of the entire gourd.
There was no place to run or hide at all. Arroyo’s only option was
to rely on his divine power and his body to resist, but once his
divine power ran dry he would be ground into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I still have
my Hellwind Golems.” Arroyo could suddenly sense those eighteen
ripples of power that were linked to him from outside the gourd.
Those were his golems, all of which were completely loyal to him. He
wasn’t dead yet, which meant they were still in his service.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join forces with
Fukai to kill that freak. Kill him!” Arroyo sent a mental order to
his eighteen Hellwind Golems. “Kill him, seize his golden gourd,
then release me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
eighteen golems responded with complete devotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Arroyo himself
knew that this was all just wishful thinking. From his battle against
Ji Ning, he knew exactly how fast Ji Ning was. Would his eighteen
Hellwind Golems really be able to succeed in killing that freak of a
cultivator, even if they worked in harmony with all those bugbeasts?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if they were lucky
enough to actually kill Ji Ning, Ji Ning’s corpse would probably
fall into Fukai’s hands. It would be incredibly difficult for the
eighteen Hellwind Golems to snatch Ji Ning’s corpse, find the
gourd, then manage to release him. Still, in principle Arroyo still
had a shot to stay alive. All he could do was try his best to seize
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden gourd in hand,
Ji Ning stared at the eighteen Hellwind Golems charging towards him.
He actually felt quite relieved upon seeing this. “Thank goodness
these golems didn’t self-destruct.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it, these
golems would soon be part of his property. For them to self-destruct
would be a terrible waste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the first great
war of the Three Realms, when the Lord of All Things had died his
Envoys had all self-destructed. However, this was primarily because
the Lord of All Things himself was very skilled in the art of
constructs. He had personally created those Envoys and had naturally
left behind certain self-destruct seals within them. By contrast,
Ning had no way of causing any of the golems he had purchased during
the treasure auction to self-destruct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo had received
these eighteen golems from his own father and similarly had no way to
make them self-destruct. The creation of each golem required an
enormous amount of blood, sweat, and precious materials. If one of
them self-destructed, it would make all that work go to waste and
render the golem useless. At most, it could be melted down to have
its Five Elements essence extracted from it. Thus, golems that were
available for sale would rarely have self-destruct mechanisms built
into them. Generally speaking, only golems that were created for
personal use by their users would possibly have self-destruct
mechanisms built into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do?!” Fukai was completely stunned. “Arroyo was
actually captured!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I flee?”
Fukai wanted to run. “But if I can’t acquire the Eternal blood,
I’ll still end up dying!” They had all sworn lifeblood oaths upon
accepting this mission from the Aeonian Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To flee was to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then… the only answer
was to fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those eighteen
Hellwind Golems haven’t given up yet. Good.” Fukai’s eyes
turned bloodshot as he pointed towards Ning and roared furiously,
“Kill him! Kill him for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AROOOO!”
“GWRAAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an
awe-inspiring army of fifty-eight bugbeasts flying through the air,
and they charged straight towards Ning alongside the eighteen
Hellwind Golems. Alas, the Thunderlight Wings on Ning’s back simply
flapped gently, allowing him to transform into an arced line that
easily moved past the attacking golems and bugbeasts. When Fukai saw
this, he was filled with despair… which only strengthened when Ning
charged straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit. Come on then!
You think you can kill me?” Fukai began to go berserk and flew
straight towards his bugbeasts and the golems. If he could ensure
that they were by his side, then Ning would have to go through them
in order to get to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Still
struggling? It won’t work.” Ning frowned slightly as he suddenly
reached back and placed his right hand upon the hilt of the sword he
was carrying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang. The Eternal
weapon, Violetjewel, came out from its sheath!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved with
incredible speed as he charged straight towards Fukai. However, a
black-armored avian bugbeast was still able to intercept him midway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning casually
struck out with the palm of his left hand, almost as if he was
swatting away a mosquito. His massive palm had been transformed to
become roughly the same size as the bugbeast, and when it landed
against the bugbeast’s body it sent the bugbeast tumbling
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this!”
When Fukai saw Ning pressing near, a look of delight appeared in his
eyes as more and more bugbeasts and golems were gathering around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dao-seal of
mine is enough to block several of his full-force attacks. If he
lands a hit on me, I’ll borrow the momentum of the strike to flee
far away from him, but he’ll remain trapped and surrounded by all
these bugbeasts and golems. He’s such an idiot! How dare he
actually charge straight inside?” Fukai was wildly excited upon
seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
relied on his speed in order to avoid the bugbeasts and golems. He
had never actually engaged them in battle, and this was his first
time actually putting himself ‘at risk’. Fukai felt the first
stirrings of hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning charged
down from above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His mighty body
smashed into a golem, sending it stumbling backwards as Ning swept
straight past it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning struck
out with his Eternal sword, Violetjewel. Violetjewel instantly
transformed into an enormous streak of bloody light, carrying an aura
of terrifying sharpness as it chopped straight towards Fukai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Quintessence
Sword-Intent], second stance - Allgod stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but…”
Fukai’s face suddenly turned pale. When Ning chopped downwards with
that terrifying sword, the bloody, baleful aura emanating from it
instantly pervaded Fukai’s mind, causing even him to be filled with
a feeling of uncontrollable fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was completely
different from last time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, Ji Ning’s
sword had ‘merely’ been able to consume more than 20% of the
energy of Fukai’s Dao-seal. The stance looked the same, but the
aura was far more powerful this time! Fukai’s very truesoul was
shuddering in horror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The aura of
golden light surrounding him trembled, then broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword-light
slammed against Fukai’s body, Fukai couldn’t help but vomit out a
mouthful of blood. He stared ashen-faced at Ning, a look of despair
in his eyes. “How is this possible? How could this have happened?
My Dao-seal still had 80% of its power remaining. How could it have
been shattered by one strike, with that strike still carrying enough
excess power to wound me!? I have a Dao armor and a protective divine
ability. Can it be that his sword is as powerful as the sword of a
Samsara Daolord?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mocking look suddenly
appeared in Fukai’s eyes. “Kill! Kill! All bugbeasts, begin
killing your peers. Wipe out all the other bugbeasts. Kill them!”
Upon seeing that terrifying strike of Ning’s, Fukai finally
realized what was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If even his Dao-seal
had been incapable of resisting a full-force attack from this
monster, this monster clearly wasn’t someone he could possibly
contend with. Most likely, Ji Ning would be able to dispatch the
bugbeasts with a single blow each. Neither Fukai nor Arroyo were a
match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill each other!
Wipe each other out! You monster, the reason you didn’t even kill a
single bugbeast was because you wanted to take control over them,
right? Haha, in your dreams!” Fukai had gone completely insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was unable to
destroy the golems under his control, and Fukai was similarly unable
to cause his bugbeasts to commit suicide. Bugbeasts were living
creatures, after all. One of the most overriding and basic of
instincts for any living creature was to stay alive! However, what
Fukai could do was to order them to fight amongst themselves. In
fact, one of the most common ways of rearing bugbeasts was to have
weak bugbeasts fight amongst themselves and devour each other,
allowing the final survivors to be incredibly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifty-eight
bugbeasts gave up chasing after Ji Ning and began to fight amongst
each other. Blood, limbs, scales, and fur flew everywhere as the
bugbeasts began a wild civil war amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aww, shit.” Ning
had originally been planning on drawing Fukai into his gourd and
slowly ‘digesting’ him with it, but his face now sank as he
changed his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” Ning
exploded forth with full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel once more
stabbed through the air, causing a terrifying streak of bloody light
to descend. Every single blow which Ning now delivered was filled
with his maximum power and was capable of destroying a fully-charged
version of the Dao-seal which Fukai had just used up. There was no
way Fukai could possibly withstand such a strike! Although he had Dao
armor and a protective divine ability, his divine power would be
quickly wrung dry by the power of these consecutive attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mere twelve blows
later, Fukai was all out of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Upon the
thirteenth sword-blow, Fukai’s body trembled a final time, then
began to split apart and crumble as though he was made out of clay.
His eyes, however, were fixed towards the skies. He could still
faintly see the blood-colored streak of sword-light that had been
left behind by the final blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such beautiful
sword-light.” Fukai closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai’s body
completely crumbled apart and his truesoul dissipated along with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo and Fukai had
sought to slay Ning in order to seize the divine blood of the
Eternal. Alas, in the end Arroyo had been sucked into the gourd while
Fukai had been slain on the spot.

Chapter 13 - The Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven died.”
Although Ji Ning had seized control over the jade green globe as fast
as he could, more than seven of the bugbeasts had died during those
brief moments of fratricide. Now, only fifty-one remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!” After
binding the globe, Ning immediately exerted his control over the
bugbeasts and ordered, “Surround those golems!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” “Yes.” …
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bugbeasts
immediately acknowledged the order obediently and began to swarm
around the Hellwind Golems, giving them no place to run.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the golden
gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo’s divine power
was being depleted at an incredibly fast rate as the power of those
two streams of energy continued to grind down at his body. His soul
was linked to the Hellwind Golems outside and so he ‘saw’
everything that had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who kill
others and take their treasures are destined to be killed in turn,
one day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo emanated a
bloody aura because his Dao was a Dao of slaughter. He had always
been the winner in his battles, and so he had advanced step by step
and left a trail of corpses behind his wake. However, this battle for
the Eternal blood was the most important battle in his life. If he
won, he would’ve become a true member of the Aeonians and
skyrocketed in status in power. However… he had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha… today,
Fukai and I have fallen to your hands. However, how many cultivators
shall truly gain eternity? One day, you will fall as well. You will
die as well! Ahahaha…” Arroyo laughed wildly, and as he did so
the last drops of his divine power were used up. His body was
shattered apart, then ground into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
crazed death throes of Arroyo within the gourd, but he remained quite
calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. The path
of cultivation was a very difficult one to tread, and only a few
Samsara Daolords existed in the Endless Territories to begin with.
Samsara Daolords treaded the line between life and death with each
step they took. How few of them would be able to take the final step,
achieving the Daomerge and gaining true eternity for themselves?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning was
determined to continue moving forward on his path, motivated by a
faint, dim hope that he would never release. He hoped that one day,
he would gain the power to reverse the flows of spacetime and bring
his wife back to his side. This was the only way he would ever be
able to see her again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One thing at a
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Hellwind
Golems had lost their master. Ning had overwhelmingly superior power
and thus was quickly able to forcibly bind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
Ning’s own godsense was spread out to cover this entire chaosworld.
The disturbance caused by his battle against Fukai and Arroyo was
quite enormous. Although both sides had kept control over themselves
and their power, the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals stationed in
this chaosworld were still so terrified that all of them had gone
into hiding and were unwilling to come out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forward
and through the world-membrane, returning to the primordial chaos
outside the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Three
Realms. Within the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ji Ning
was standing here within the primordial chaos, staring towards the
Three Realms. Although his Primaltwin had stood guard over the Three
Realms this entire time, his lifeblood oath made it so that he was
completely unable to actually re-join the Three Realms. Only upon
reaching Vastheaven Palace and completing the lifeblood oath would
Ning be able to return to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After mastering the
‘Sword World’, Ning was now capable of seeing through the
primordial chaos and into the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many ‘secrets’
of the Three Realms were no longer secrets to Ning. Everything was
laid bare before his eyes, including its structural underpinnings as
well as its core. He could even see an illusory, formless river that
flowed through everything within it. This was the River of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, all creatures
within the Endless Territories had their own destinies, and these
destinies were all joined together into a great Sea of Destiny. The
Three Realms was just a single chaosworld and thus it had just a
single River of Destiny. The countless Rivers of Destiny of the
endless chaosworlds within the territories were like countless tiny
streams that would join together to form the enormous Sea of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The River of
Destiny…” Ning’s gaze pierced through the Void and the
primordial chaos alike as he stared at the River of Destiny. He could
see the countless truesouls that had been submerged within it as well
as the destinies of cultivators and mortals alike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father! Mother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw them. Deep
within the River of Destiny, there was a pair of truesouls who clung
tightly to each other. Those were the truesouls of his father Ji
Yichuan and his mother Yuchi Snow. Even though they were dead and
their truesouls had been swept into the River of Destiny, they
remained by each other’s sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother. Wait
for me just a bit longer. Your son has already become a World God.
Soon, I’ll head out to Vastheaven Palace. Once I reach Vastheaven
Palace and complete my lifeblood oath, I’ll be able to re-enter the
Three Realms and draw your truesouls out from the River of Destiny.”
Ning’s heart was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was clearly
something that he could do with ease, with but the wave of a hand.
Alas, he knew that if he truly stretched so much as a finger into the
Three Realms, his true body and his Primaltwin would both be attacked
and destroyed by the lifeblood oath he had sworn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wait a bit
longer,” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared off in the distance. It was a white-haired, white-bearded
old man dressed in Daoist robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Subhuti
smiled. Just now, he had gone to Ning’s estate within the
primordial chaos but had been unable to find Ning. He knew that his
disciple had to have come to this place, as this was where his
disciple would often go to stare at the Three Realms. Alas, he could
see everything happening within it but couldn’t take so much as a
single step within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-…” Subhuti’s
face suddenly changed as he stared at Ning. He took a careful look,
then a second, then a third.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The World level?”
Subhuti’s voice was quavering slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I broke through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An excited look was now
on Subhuti’s face. “That’s wonderful. I’ve been worrying
about you ever since you started your journeys into the Endless
Territories. Now that you have at least reached the World level,
things will be much easier for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, as the
saying goes there’s always a taller mountain. Even though you have
reached the World level, disciple, you must not be overconfident and
brash. You don’t have many supporters or helpers in the Endless
Territories. You’ll have to rely on yourself for everything. Those
of us in the Three Realms won’t be of much aid either. You have to
be careful,” Subhuti said. Although he didn’t know what Ning had
experienced thus far, the Three Realms did know a bit about the
Badlands Territory and knew that it was a place of constant struggles
and battles between cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Ning to emerge
unscathed and at an even higher level of power meant that he
absolutely had to have experienced and survived many of those
life-and-death battles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. Your
disciple isn’t so foolish as to think himself invincible.” Ning
laughed. “I’m still dreaming of one day meeting with Mother Nuwa,
you know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you heard any
news of Mother Nuwa in the territories outside?” Subhuti
immediately asked. All of the first-generation Fiendgods who were
born from the primordial chaos were filled with tremendous respect
and veneration towards Mother Nuwa. She had reached the World level
back when she was in the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have not. I don’t
have any news about her at all. In fact, there have been no new World
Gods in the Badlands Territory who seem even remotely similar to
her.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…” Subhuti
shook his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Master,
I’d like to trouble you to help me with something. Please send word
to the Three Realms right away that I am intending to transmit
certain techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts to our fellow
Daoists of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transmit?” Subhuti
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In the past,
I wasn’t able to do so. Now that I’ve become a World God myself,
things have changed,” Ning said. In recent years, he had killed
quite a few enemies and seized their treasures, but it was rare for
cultivators at this level to carry cultivation manuals on them.
Everything was firmly imprinted into their minds. The only reason
World God Northrest had left behind so many manuals was because he
was planning to bring up a successor in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now far more
powerful than World God Northrest had been, but he simply hadn’t
spent enough time cultivating and adventuring. The number of
transmittable techniques he had acquired during his adventures could
be counted on one hand. Although he could purchase certain techniques
from the Badlands Everworld, he still wouldn’t be able to bring
them back to the Three Realms right away. He’d have to first
memorize and master them, then write them down again. This would take
an extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had correctly
predicted that by the time he finished, he would probably already
have reached the World level. World God Northrest had already given
Ning many techniques which he could transmit to others upon him
becoming a World God himself. Now, Ning had full and free control
over them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good!”
Subhuti said excitedly, “This is wonderful. With these powerful
techniques by our side, the Three Realms might give birth to new
World Gods and Chaos Immortals in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had the feeling
that the Three Realms was not an ordinary place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was in the Three
Realms that Daoist Three Purities found the incredibly valuable Nine
Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had
also given birth to absolutely dazzling figures such as Nuwa and
Houyi, all of whom had created their own techniques since there was
no one present to teach and guide them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I transmit
these techniques to them, I need to go exploring the primordial chaos
around the Three Realms and see if I can find the original Nine Chaos
Seals,” Ning mused. Many of his fellow disciples were actually
incredibly talented; they simply had never gotten access to
techniques that could guide them to becoming World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms was
about to undergo a true golden age of cultivation and explode in
power. Ning was very eager to see this happen. If he was the only
person capable of protecting the Three Realms, what would happen to
it if something happened to him? If the Three Realms had numerous
experts on Ning’s level within it, it would become a truly safe
place for its denizens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying ship was
sailing through the primordial chaos. Ning and the Flamefairy were
both seated within the ship, staring out towards the primordial
chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, were you
waylaid by Fukai and Arroyo?” Su Youji immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?” Su
Youji asked. She didn’t know if Ning had fled on his own or if he
had won that battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sitting right
here before you. How do you think it went?” Ning smiled. “They
lost. Both died on the battlefield.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji wasn’t able
to take part in that battle but had been quite worried. She knew that
Fukai and Arroyo were both very powerful figures, especially Arroyo.
He not only was a transcendent World God, he was also surrounded by a
bloodthirsty aura that testified to his prowess in battle. Given the
many treasures that they had… she couldn’t help but worry. Her
life was bound to Ji Ning’s, after all. If Ji Ning died, she would
be at the mercy of his killer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where shall we go
next?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us return to the
Badlands Court first. Later, we’ll leave.” Ning stared at the
outside world. His first priority was to return to the Badlands Court
and get rid of the Eternal blood.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flew aboard the

back to the Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is. The
Badlands Court.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Su Youji
were walking atop the waves as they advanced. Soon, they reached the
island located in the center of the lake, the island which held the
Badlands Court. In front of the island was a crimson-haired man
dressed in loose robes who smiled at the two of them. “Brother
Darknorth, congratulations for becoming a World-level cultivator. Oh,
the Flamefairy broke through as well? It seems this recent trip has
been tremendously beneficial to the two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Qichang, why
are you here?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master instructed me
to stay here and wait for you.” The crimson-haired man laughed.
“Come, I’ll take you to meet with Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
amazed. Daolord Badlands truly lived up to his reputation for
divination. Indeed, Ning was planning to ask him to help dispose of
the Eternal blood. Somehow, the Daolord knew about it even before
Ning asked to speak with him, thus choosing to send a disciple out to
come greet him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, you can go to
the Water Curtain Home for now,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
departed obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please lead the way,
brother Qichang.” Ning and the crimson-haired man advanced
side-by-side. The Badlands Court was laid out in a truly intricate
way and filled with many formations. If no one was around to guide
him, Ning truly wouldn’t have been able to locate Daolord Badlands’
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two quickly arrived
at a quiet, secluded courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The courtyard was quite
simple and unadorned. Daolord Badlands was relaxing in the lotus
position, a single flask of wine on the table in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ve
brought Darknorth as instructed,” the crimson-haired man said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave now,”
Daolord Badlands instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crimson-haired man
acknowledged the order, then respectfully departed. Daolord Badlands
turned his gaze towards Ning. A hint of a smile on his face, he
pointed at the other seat and said, “Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Daolord.”
Ning sat down in the lotus position before Daolord Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve reached the
World level? Old brother Solesky will be quite happy to hear this.”
Daolord Badlands laughed. “This morning, I could sense that
something was going to happen. I did some careful Numerancy and
divined that there is something that you wish me to help you with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
immediately nodded. “There is indeed something. This junior was
fortunate enough to acquire a treasure within the Allgod Estate known
as the ‘divine blood of the Eternal’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eternal blood?”
A shocked look appeared on Daolord Badlands’ face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was skilled
in the art of Numerancy, he wasn’t all-knowing. Divining the future
through Numerancy was actually quite difficult and there would be
many things that were left unclear. Using Numerancy to divine the
past was actually much easier, because it involved things that had
already happened. Things in the future had obviously yet to happen,
and thus almost anything was possible! Future Numerancy was generally
only capable of calculating out some particularly major events.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was
specifically coming to ask Daolord Badlands for help, and so Daolord
Badlands had been able to sense it. Just a simple bit of Numerancy
was enough to tell him that Ji Ning was coming to ask for his
assistance. By then, Ji Ning had already reached the Badlands
Everworld and was heading towards the Badlands Court, giving this bit
of Numerancy an extremely highly credible interval.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it the Eternal
blood of Emperor Melobo?” Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I hear that the Aeonians would do anything to get their hands on
this Eternal blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course they
would!” Daolord Badlands’ eyes lit up as he smiled. “That drop
of Eternal blood represents half of the life energy and vitality of
Emperor Melobo. It took him forever to recover from that loss. That
drop of Eternal blood is uncalculably valuable to them, and it’s
something which will never appear on the open market. It is more
valuable and alluring to the Aeonians than you could ever imagine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “I heard
the spirits of the Allgod Estate say the same, which is why I’m
worrying about the proper way to dispose of this Eternal blood.
That’s why I came to ask you for help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The simplest
solution is to offer it to the Dao Alliance.” Daolord Badlands
chuckled. “But I have another idea, if you are interested.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pray tell, Daolord.”
Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sell your drop of
Eternal blood to me,” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
slightly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you offer it to
the Dao Alliance, they’ll probably give you two million cubes of
chaos nectar as well as grant you immediate entrance into the
alliance. If you sell it to me… although I won’t be able to bring
you into the Dao Alliance, I’d be willing to give you three million
cubes! What’s more, given how strong you are, you’ll definitely
be granted entry into the Dao Alliance in the future.” Daolord
Badlands continued, “If there are any techniques or treasures that
you want, just tell me and we can deduct it from that balance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands truly
wished to take possession of that drop of Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance itself
wouldn’t have much use for it, but it was still an incredibly rare
and valuable item! Whenever a drop of concentrated Eternal blood
appeared in the Dao Alliance, it would immediately be purchased by
its most powerful Samsara Daolords or Eternal Emperors. Someone like
Daolord Badlands wouldn’t even have a chance! Once those powerful
Samsara Daolords acquired the blood, they would analyze it and
research it to gain insights from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that this drop of Eternal blood was the concentrated blood essence
distilled from more than half the blood and flesh of a mighty Eternal
Emperor of the Aeonian race. This had represented an enormous drop in
Emperor Melobo’s power. No Eternal Emperor would be willing to make
such a sacrifice… and the number of Aeonian Emperor’s could be
counted on one hand to begin with!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the ‘set’
price of two million cubes which the Dao Alliance was willing to pay
was an incredibly low price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
naturally grew desirous of this drop of blood…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands was
actually a dazzling talented Daolord as well. As the Goldeye Golem
had put it, if he was able to reach the Verge of the Daomerge then he
would become a terrifyingly powerful figure who would be as strong as
Daolord Allgod had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dazzling talents such
as him naturally were filled with tremendous ambitions! In the past,
he didn’t have that much wealth; even if you placed that drop of
Eternal blood in front of him, he wouldn’t pay it much attention.
But in order to get his assistance, Daolord Solesky had prepared a
gift of tremendous value for him. Daolord Solesky was a Palace Lord
of Vastheaven Palace and had been alive for an extremely long period
of time, accumulating enormous amounts of wealth. He had offered
roughly twenty million cubes of chaos nectar for Daolord Badlands’
assistance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of those treasures
were meant for Daolord Badlands to rebuild his avatar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
actually had numerous plans for them, but now that Ji Ning had
brought a drop of Eternal blood to his doorstep, he suddenly changed
his plans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps some of my
children will be able to draw out the power of the Aeonians from
within that drop,” Daolord Badlands mused to himself. “My
divinations indicate that there is a better than 20% chance of them
succeeding in this endeavor. First, Daolord Solesky came bearing
fabulous gifts. Now, my young friend Ji Ning is asking me to help him
deal with this Eternal blood. This is a karmic blessing which destiny
has bestowed upon me. I have to seize it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Daolord Badlands looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m in no rush to
join the Dao Alliance. All I want to do is get rid of this Eternal
blood as soon as I can,” Ning said with a laugh. “Selling it to
the Dao Alliance, selling it to you… it’s all the same to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Daolord
Badlands laughed. “Three million cubes of chaos nectar. The average
networth of most powerful Daolords is roughly in this range. My young
friend Ji Ning, you must make sure not to waste this tremendous
blessing. Tell me, which treasures, techniques, and divine abilities
do you desire? I’ll help you find them and buy them. But of course,
if all you want is chaos nectar then I can provide that as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would be the point
of acquiring that much chaos nectar? Was he supposed to eat it like
food? The best solution was for Ning to use it to help himself grow
more powerful as soon as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to acquire
the final part of a divine ability,” Ning said. “This divine
ability is known as the [Golden Idol].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The protective
divine ability, [Golden Idol]?” Daolord Badlands nodded. “That
won’t be too hard. I can buy it for you from the Dao Alliance. Do
you want it for yourself or do you wish to be able to teach it to
others? If you wish to be able to teach it to others, the price will
be dozens of times higher.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll use it for
myself.” Ning wasn’t going to waste his money like that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
is quite powerful. It can make your body as tough as a top-grade Dao
weapon. Abilities on this level are fairly rare. I’ll help you buy
it, but it’ll take two hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. This was even more valuable than a Pseudo Samsara Pill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it cost that much
just for him to train in, then wouldn’t that mean a version he
could transmit to others would cost several million cubes? No wonder
that not even Vastheaven Palace had access to such a wonderful
technique. Large clans and sects all had many expenses they had to
pay. World God Northrest switched to training in the [Golden Idol]
after acquiring it, but he had only gained access to the upper
portion and the middle portion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
only Samsara Daolords need to have bodies that are as tough as
top-grade Dao weapons,” Daolord Badlands said. “Honestly, I don’t
know why you are in such a rush to buy it. Still, you now are worth
more than three million cubes of chaos nectar. Buying it won’t
cause you much trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. He might
not be a Daolord, but he did have a body that was comparable to a
Daolord’s body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What else do you
need?” Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard of an
Eternal treasure known as the Elementum Waterflame Gourd,” Ning
said. “I wish to buy it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right! That
is indeed a good treasure. It is fairly cheap, but extremely useul
for World-level experts.” Daolord Badlands immediately nodded.
“This gourd will require roughly half a million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elementum
Waterflame Gourd…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It held both Firecloud
Lightning as well as Watersmoke Lightning within it. Both were
considered types of Dao-level lightning! These were two of the nine
types of Dao lightning which Ning would need in order to train in the
secret art of lightning known as [Novessence Thunder] technique. By
buying this item, Ning would be able to use these two types of
lightning for now as well as use them to train in the [Novessence
Thunder] later. Two birds with one stone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao lightning was
extremely expensive because capturing it was incredibly difficult. A
single type of Dao lightning would generally be worth a minimum of
two hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Firecloud Lightning and
Watersmoke Lightning were two fairly common types of Dao lightning.
There were certain rare types of Dao lightning that simply couldn’t
be found on the market at all. Even Daolord Allgod had only found
nine types of lightning that were suitable for his usage!
</P>

Chapter 15 - Violetjewel’s Background
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had long ago
decided that he was going to train in the [Novessence Thunder] secret
art. Alas, while he was in the Allgod Estate he didn’t even have
access to nine types of chaos lightning, and so he was in no rush to
start learning the technique just yet. After mastering nine types of
chaos lightning, he would then test out mastering the nine types of
Dao lightning with this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, according to
the secret art’s descriptions, only World-level cultivators could
train in chaos lightning while only Samsara Daolords could train in
Dao lightning. Thus, for now Ning simply purchased two of the
relevant types of Dao lightning. In all honesty, he probably couldn’t
afford purchasing all nine types; even Daolord Allgod was only able
to get nine!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lower portion of
the [Golden Idol] and the Elementum Waterflame Gourd. That’s not
even a million cubes.” Daolord Badlands looked at Ning. “Need any
other treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mirrorsnow
Paintings. I need the second and the fourth paintings. Would I be
able to buy these two?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
glanced at Ning, then chuckled. “It seems this trip to the Allgod
Estate truly was a lucky one for you. The Mirrorsnow Paintings hold
the legacy of Emperor Mirrorsnow within them. Although he had
released a total of forty of these paintings into the Endless
Territories, there’s simply far too many cultivators. How about
this? I’ll ask the Dao Alliance and see if anyone is willing to
sell those two paintings. However, I can’t guarantee they’ll be
available.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can get it,
let’s give it a shot.” Ning didn’t try to force it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anything else?”
Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord, please take
a look at this.” Ning drew Violetjewel from its sheath on his back.
Given that the two were discussing a business deal worth three
million cubes of chaos nectar, a single Eternal weapon truly didn’t
mean much. Some Eternal weapons were worth as little as ten thousand
cubes, while valuable ones were still generally worth just a few
hundred thousand cubes. Eternal weapons worth over a million cubes
were very rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword has been
by my side for an extended period of time. Its previous owner was big
brother Northrest, who named it ‘Violetjewel’.” Ning continued,
“I wish to understand where it came from and want to see if I can
get five more matching sets of this Eternal sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just so. Since he had
three million cubes of chaos nectar to use up, Ning wanted to ensure
that he’d be able to wield six Eternal weapons in any future
battles! This would allow his attack power to increase dramatically,
and he’d feel confident in battling even an enemy Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was all because
Ning’s [Nameless] sword-art was a technique that allowed for an
airtight defense. If Ning used all six swords to focus on defense,
then so long as the opponent wasn’t overwhelmingly more powerful
Ning would still be able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Violetjewel?”
Daolord Badlands accepted the sword, then gently stroked its blade.
As he did so, Ning released his control over the sword-intent hidden
within Violetjewel’s quintessence core, letting its savage,
bloodthirsty aura surge outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just so. It truly is
Violetjewel.” Daolord Badlands nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It ‘truly is?’”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This would be
considered a middle-grade Eternal weapon.” Daolord Badlands
laughed. “Once you become a Daolord of the First Step, you’ll be
able to unleash the full power of this Eternal weapon. For now, it’ll
be more than enough for you to wield while you remain within the
World level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. In truth,
low-grade, middle-grade, high-grade, and top-grade Eternal weapons
were all the same to Ning. If the sword-intent contained within an
Eternal weapon’s quintessence core was too powerful, Ning wouldn’t
be able to make much use of it. Just as Daolord Badlands said, Ning
would probably only be able to fully unleash the power of Violetjewel
when he became a Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Ning was given
a top-grade Eternal sword, he wouldn’t be able to unleash much of
its power for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You said that this
sword’s previous owner called it ‘Violetjewel’. This wasn’t a
name he chose at random,” Daolord Badlands said. “This is the
name given to the sword by the Eternal Emperor who forged it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was forged by an
Eternal Emperor?” Ning was quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long, long ago, that
Eternal Emperor was an Emperor of the Dao Alliance! However, he ended
up choosing to venture into the Endless Dark long ago. His name was
Emperor Violetmount. Before he left the Endless Territories and
entered the Endless Dark, he spent an extremely long period of time
to create a total of ninety-nine middle-grade Eternal weapons which
he named Violetjewel, nine top-grade Eternal weapons which he named
Bloodpeak, and a terrifying weapon infused with all of his insights
into the Dao of the Sword which he named the ‘Violetmount Sword’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless
upon hearing this. Ninety-nine Violetjewel swords? Nine Bloodpeak
swords? A Violetmount sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was all done by
Emperor Violetmount?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you wish to
procure five more Violetjewels?” Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I would ideally
like to buy five of them.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
nodded. “Although Emperor Violetmount originally created
ninety-nine of them, some of them ended up being lost over the course
of many years. Others are currently being used by other cultivators.
Thus, buying five will be quite difficult. Still, I’ll ask the Dao
Alliance to help out. Their power is spread throughout the entire
Endless Territories; they just might be able to locate a few of these
swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands looked
at Ning. “I have to warn you in advance, this situation is
completely different from the situation we saw in the treasure
auction. Treasures in that auction all start at a very low reserve
price, and even the final price for each item won’t be particularly
high. Since you are actively seeking out these specific items, they
will definitely cost you much more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
quite well. The treasure auctions were all fairly cheap; buying
treasures at the normal ‘listed’ price in the outside world would
generally cost significantly more! As for someone like Ning who was
actively looking for very specific items, the price would definitely
be even higher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How high would it
be?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single Violetjewel
sword generally goes for just a hundred thousand cubes or so.
However, since you are actively seeking out this specific sword it’ll
probably take a hundred and fifty thousand, maybe even two hundred
thousand,” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any price below two
hundred thousand is acceptable,” Ning said. He was no fool. If the
price was too high, it really wouldn’t be worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that middle-grade Eternal weapons would generally go for anywhere
from thirty thousand to sixty thousand cubes of chaos nectar in the
treasure auctions. The normal list price, however, would be around a
hundred thousand cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since Ning was actively
seeking out these specific swords, the price could rise to as much as
two hundred thousand cubes. In all honesty, this was quite a high
price. Two hundred thousand cubes would be enough to easily buy a
high-grade Eternal weapon during a treasure auction. If you were
lucky, you might even be able to snag a cheap top-grade Eternal
weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anything else?”
Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, that’s plenty.
I don’t need anything else for now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. How about
this? Give me a bit of time, roughly half a year or so, and I’ll
give you a million cubes of chaos nectar for you to use it as you see
fit,” Daolord Badlands said. “As for the treasures you are
seeking, since I’ll need to ask the Dao Alliance to help out it’ll
probably take a good deal longer. If we are lucky, it might take just
four or five years. If we are unlucky, it might take a few decades.
If there are any leftover cubes of chaos nectar, I’ll hand that
over to you as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Daolord,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two reasons
Ning had chosen to ask Daolord Badlands for help. The first was that
Daolord Badlands was on extremely good terms with Daolord Solesky.
The second was that the formation-spirits of the Allgod Estate had
suggested that Ning go seek him out. Daolord Badlands was a
dazzlingly talented figure who had an extremely resolute Dao-heart.
Even if he lost all of his treasures, he wouldn’t throw away his
own principles or his own path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands was
extremely skilled in Numerancy divination, which meant that it was
actually quite rare for him to go out adventuring. His style of
cultivation was quite different from that of most other Samsara
Daolords. This was why he didn’t have that much treasure. In truth,
it was all thanks to Daolord Solesky’s gift of twenty million cubes
worth of treasure that he had become so wealthy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even so, he didn’t
have much actual chaos nectar. What he had was a large collection of
random treasures and materials, which was why he told Ning he would
need half a year for the first million cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked back to the
Water Curtain Home, his heart filled with emotions. “Eternal
weapons are considered incomparably valuable to World-level
cultivators, but they are nothing special to Samsara Daolords. I
never would’ve thought that there would be ninety-nine copies of
Violetjewel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I get those
treasures, I’ll be much more powerful than I am right now.” Ning
always felt as though he should do his best to convert his chaos
nectar into treasures as soon as possible. Even if he eventually
outgrew them in the future, he could still convert them back into
chaos nectar by selling them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
had returned to the Water Curtain Home earlier. She now came running
out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, today we
shall rest. Tomorrow, we are going to Waveshift City,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift City?”
Su Youji immediately asked, “Why are we going there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You broke through to
the World level. We need to find you some suitable treasures!” Ning
laughed. “Spend some time picking what you like once we get there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su
Youji’s eyes lit up as she nodded repeatedly. Generally speaking,
the master was responsible for outfitting his retainers with
treasures. Still, most masters were quite stingy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, wasn’t
stingy. And yet, he simply wouldn’t be able to afford giving Su
Youji a set of Eternal weapons! Su Youji was a Chaos Immortal, and
Chaos Immortals generally relied on sets of many powerful weapons. If
every weapon in a set was an Eternal weapon, the cost of the set
would be utterly astronomical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift City.”
Another reason why Ning was heading to Waveshift City was because he
needed to buy those nine types of chaos lightning. That way, he’d
be able to start with the [Novessence Thunder] secret art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The very next day, Ning
and Su Youji set off for Waveshift City and went on a huge shopping
spree. Fukai and Arroyo had both left behind quite a bit of chaos
nectar and many treasures, giving Ning quite a bit of spare cash.
Soon, the two had purchased everything they wanted, including the
nine types of chaos lightning which Ning had been searching for.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position atop the sandy beaches of an oceanic island. Next
to him was a black gourd and four other gourds. The black gourd was
the Pentabolt Gourd while the other four gourds were ordinary gourds
that each held a different type of chaos lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five types of
chaos lightning within the Pentabolt Gourd are five types that I can
use. I have all nine types of chaos lightning and am ready to start.”
Ning began to mentally prepare the [Novessence Thunder] secret art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to activate
his Immortal energy, sending it into one of the gourds. This gourd
was filled with a streak of black lightning that radiated an aura of
both insidious coldness and extraordinary ruthlessness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Immortal
energy was guided by the [Novessence Thunder] technique to form a
very unique web of energy that began to envelop the chaos lightning.
Chaos lightning generally wasn’t capable of defeating even weak
World-level cultivators; they were only capable of dominating
cultivators below that level! Given how pure Ning’s Immortal energy
was thanks to his body being formed by the merging of seventeen
clones, he was able to easily seize control over that streak of chaos
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” The
web of Immortal energy completely surrounded that streak of insidious
black lightning. No matter how much it struggled or how it flared its
power, the web of Immortal energy merely expanded and contracted
alongside it. The web was extremely tough and tenacious, giving the
black lightning no place to run at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, I risked
my life and lost multiple clones in order to tame the Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent… but now, compared to this technique of Daolord
Allgod’s, that technique was unfathomably weak and meaningless.”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh. Daolord Allgod’s technique was like
an incredibly wise fisherman, with the lightning being his fish; no
matter how the lightning struggled or writhed, it was completely
unable to escape the control of the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, merely seizing
control over the lightning was just the simplest starting point for
this secret art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The web of Immortal
energy squeezed around the streak of black lightning as it dragged it
into Ning’s body. Soon, it was pulled into the realm of chaos which
now existed inside of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Jindan chaos region
was a blurry, hazy region. At its very center stood a luxuriously
flourishing Dao-tree which stood more than sixty thousand meters
tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Essence of
lightning… take form!” Immortal energy began to ripple through
the chaos ‘mud’ that existed in a corner of this chaos region,
taking shape and transforming into an enormous formation. A streak of
black lightning thundered down angrily upon the formation. Boom! The
formation was instantly filled with Immortal energy that fed hungrily
upon the power of the black lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless streaks of
black lightning began to flicker throughout the rune-patterns that
covered the entire massive formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the lightning
essences has been contained, for now at least.” Ning nodded to
himself. Establishing an essence of lightning was actually quite
simple; the hardest part would be actually merging them to manifest
the [Novessence Thunder] secret art. He would have to merge all nine
types of chaos lightning in a manner similar to merging many
ingredients into the production of a pill. Only then would the
complicated secret art become usable. This would be thousands of
times more difficult than simply forming the lightning essence was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself was
secretly nervous about this. Would he be able to succeed? Daolord
Allgod was a master of alchemy and artificing, a truly peerless
expert in these areas. Ning, however, wasn’t skilled in either
regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next.” Ning once
again reached out, seizing control over another one of the eight
types of chaos lightning after another. His vast Jindan chaos region
quickly became filled with eight more types of lightning essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine types of
lightning essence crackled and clashed against each other, each
holding different types of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The easiest part is
done. Next comes the hard part, where I actually forge the
[Novessence Thunder] secret art. Let’s see if I can do this.”
Ning felt a sense of pressure, even though this was a secret art
‘merely’ formed by chaos lightning; it would be much simpler than
doing the same with Dao lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using nine types of Dao
lightning to form the secret art would be much more complicated.
Still, Ning understood that even ‘merely’ using nine types of
chaos lightning would be incredibly hard for the vast majority of
World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pure Immortal
energy poured into the nine types of lightning essence. The process
of converting the chaos lightning into lightning essence had already
caused the explosive, raging power of the lightning to be tamed by
the formation. This method was far superior to the technique Ning had
used to tame the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle. Hiss. Pop. The
nine streaks of lightning began to fly into the air under the control
of Ning’s Immortal energy. They wrapped around each other,
intertwining like the limbs of lovers and beginning to join together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine types of
lightning suddenly broke apart and dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I failed.” Ning
shook his head. “According to the instructions, I have to be able
to merge all nine types of lightning into one in order to form the
seed of this secret art. Afterwards, with the passage of time, I’ll
be able to use the nine types of chaos lightning through this seed in
unleashing this secret art.” Ning felt a headache coming. “Although
I’ve tamed all nine streaks of lightning, I still need to perfectly
match them together in a specific format that requires tens of
thousands of steps. The lightning is simply too explosive and
violent. The slightest mistake will result in failure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Immortal
energy was sufficiently pure, and his control over his energy was
sufficiently strong. Given that his soul was being reinforced by the
azureflower mist energy, it was similarly strong enough for him to
maintain incredible control over the lightning. And yet, he still
failed in the end. This was precisely because Daolord Allgod’s
secret art was simply too detailed and complicated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll try it
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tried again and
again to form the seed to this secret art. If he could succeed just
once, the seed would be permanently formed and he wouldn’t need to
spend all this energy and effort in the future. He’d be able to
simply use this seed to activate the secret art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas… it truly was
difficult! Ning tried more than a hundred times, failing each time.
Even his powerful soul was beginning to feel exhausted by the
process. There was one time where he very nearly succeeded, but he
ended up failing at one of the final steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to rest
for a while,” Ning mumbled to himself. “Simply merging nine types
of chaos lightning is already incredibly difficult. How hard will it
be for me to merge Dao lightning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey…” Just as
Ning was about to take a break, he suddenly noticed something within
his body. “The azureflower mist energy can convert Immortal energy,
divine power, and heartforce.” Ning mused to himself, “Although
there’s no way for it to leave my body, it can easily enter the
Jindan chaos region inside of me. If Immortal energy can be used to
control the lightning, can the azureflower mist energy be used to do
the same?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azureflower mist
energy was far stronger than the Immortal energy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
try.” Ning immediately felt a hint of eagerness. Previously, he had
dispersed his azureflower mist energy and sent it throughout his
body, with a little residing within the Jindan chaos region as well.
Now, Ning sent more and more of the azureflower mist energy into the
Jindan chaos region, where it began to fly straight towards the nine
types of lightning essence that crackled at the margins of the
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine streams of
azureflower mist energy were like nine roving dragons that burrowed
straight into the nine types of lightning essence. Upon the energy
entering the lightning essence, Ning was ready to give controlling
them a shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the nine
types of chaos lightning began to fly upwards. It was extremely easy,
and the chaos lightning flew about in an extremely obedient manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it actually
works. Using the azureflower mist energy to control the lightning is
a hundred times easier than using my Immortal energy.” Ning was
delighted. If previously it had been as difficult as an ordinary man
wielding a gigantic greataxe, Ning now felt like he was an ordinary
man who was wielding a pair of chopsticks. It was so easy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine streaks of
lightning coiled around in the air, mixing together in a perfect
manner and transforming to become something else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine streaks of
lightning merged into eight streaks, then seven…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, only one
streak of lightning was left. It was a streak of crimson-gold
lightning that radiated an aura of power that was so great that Ning
trembled in fear. It vastly surpassed any other type of chaos
lightning in power, and Ning felt certain that most likely even Dao
lightning wouldn’t be much stronger than it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crimson-gold
lightning suddenly slammed downwards, smashing against the ‘mud’
of the formation. Instantly, the formation drew in the power of the
crimson-gold lightning. It seemed to come to life as an enormous seal
took form atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seed of the
secret art has taken shape.” Ning let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, the nine
types of lightning essence would simply release their power and allow
it to be converted by the seed, giving birth to that terrifying
crimson-gold lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Novessence
Thunder] formed by chaos lightning should be able to kill any
master-class World God with a single blast.” After getting a good
sense for how powerful the crimson-gold lightning was, he felt even
more convinced of Daolord Allgod’s might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given how
strong Ning currently was, the [Novessence Thunder] would primarily
be used as a ‘domain’ type effect, causing a large amount of
lightning to surround and trap his foes. It must be understood that a
domain that was capable of easily slaying master-class World Gods
would serve as a terrifyingly strong constraint upon others!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When two individuals
were on the same general level of power, for one side to be
constrained in some manner would have a huge impact on a battle
between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod himself
had used his nine secret arts at the same time to trap and constrain
his foes. As a result, even someone like Emperor Melobo had been
forced to flee. Emperor Melobo had damn near died, and in the end he
had lost an enormous amount of flesh and blood which Dalord Allgod
had refined into that drop of Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now in a
superb mood after having successfully forged the [Novessence
Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two short months later,
Daolord Badlands returned with a million cubes of chaos nectar.
Although Ning had mentally prepared himself to receive such a vast
fortune, his heart still shook when it actually entered his hands.
For such a sum of chaos nectar to actually before him was still quite
a stunning sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For most Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals, a mere hundred bottles was already an incredible
fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For World-level
cultivators, a hundred cubes was a shocking sum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million cubes was
enough to cause even Samsara Daolords turn green-eyed with envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really have never
seen so much of it before.” Ning was located within a miniature
estate-world which held a small pond within it. Ning stared at this
elegant-looking small pond, which was merely thirty meters in size.
It really was quite small… but Ning’s eyes couldn’t help but
shine as he stared at it. This entire pool was formed from chaos
nectar!

Chapter 17 - The Trial of the Painting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After feeling stunned
for a while, Ji Ning regained his normal composure. In the end,
outside sources of power were extraneous. The path of cultivation was
a path where one would have to rely on one’s self.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go test out
the Mirrorsnow Paintings,” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mirrorsnow
Paintings could only be entered once one reached the World level, and
only World-level cultivators were granted entry; Samsara Daolords
were unable to go inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what sort
of trials Emperor Mirrorsnow left behind? Time to take a look.”
More than two months had passed since he had returned from the
Badlands Court. It had only taken him a single day to form the
[Novessence Thunder] technique. The rest of his time had been spent
ruminating over the Dao of the Sword. Ning had gained quite a few
insights since his battle against Arroyo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had acquired the
first Mirrorsnow Painting from the crocodilian bugbeast in the Grove
of Monoliths within the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now seated by
the sandy shores of that oceanic island, admiring the first painting.
The painting was of a beautifully decorated palace, but the artistic
quality of it really was rather low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In I go.” Ning had
bound the first Mirrorsnow Painting long ago. He now filled it with
his Immortal energy, and his World-level energy instantly connected
to the estate-world located within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the world
of the painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
at his surroundings. Moments ago, he had been atop a sandy beach.
Now, he was located within a towering palace that was carved out of
jade. Its pillars glowed with golden light and were filled with
carvings of strange beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of Ning, far
off into the distance up the stairs, there was a golden throne. A
figure suddenly appeared before the golden throne. It was a tall,
golden-robed man who sat down atop the throne, staring downwards
towards Ning like an emperor staring at his subject.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After so many years,
a new World-level cultivator has finally entered.” The golden-robed
emperor said, “Junior, the Eternal Emperor ordered me to wait here
for you. All you need to do is defeat me. If you can defeat me,
you’ll have passed the trial of this estate-world. The four
Mirrorsnow Paintings hold a total of four estate-worlds within them.
If you can pass all four trials, you shall become a true, personal
disciple of the Eternal Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defeat you?” Ning
looked at the golden-robed emperor. “Might I ask, what techniques
am I permitted to use in this attempt?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are not
permitted to use Immortal energy or divine power. You must rely on
nothing more than your own raw physical strength, and I’ll use the
same amount of strength as you. The two of us shall compete in
swordplay and nothing but swordplay. Neither of us shall use divine
abilities, secret arts, or anything else,” the golden-robed emperor
said. “If you can defeat me, you will have won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
This was a test of his sword-arts. The four paintings represented
four major challenges. Daolord Windsource’s disciple had access to
the third painting for an extremely long period of time, but he still
remained unable to pass its trial. This was a testament to how
difficult the trial would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.” A
Frostice sword appeared within Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” The
golden-robed emperor rose to his feet, a broad golden longsword
appearing in his hands as well. He slowly walked down the stairs, his
aura growing in power as he did so. It was as though he was the one
and only sovereign of this world, as though everything had to
prostrate before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face tightened
slightly. What a terrifying sword-art! The man had yet to strike, but
the sword-intent radiating from him had already caused Ning to feel a
sense of danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great Firmament
stance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning made his move. The
Frostice sword in his hand struck out, causing the entire palace to
become submerged within an endless mist of sword-light which
blanketed everything. Although the Great Firmament stance was the
third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, it represented an entire
Sword World. As Ning’s sword-arts and cultivation continued to
improve, his Sword World would naturally become increasingly powerful
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seemingly endless
Sword World was like a vast net that completely encompassed the
golden-robed emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">HUAAAANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of a sword
‘roaring’ suddenly filled the entire palace as a golden streak of
sword-light tore apart that endless Sword World. It was like the
rising of the dawn sun casting its first glow of light upon the
world, and it completely shattered Ning’s sword-arts apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was just barely
able to use his own sword to block this attack, but he was knocked
flying backwards by the force of the collision. Boom! He struck
directly against the closed gate beneath him, causing a loud bang to
be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a dominating
sword-art!” Ning was truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a sword-art
that was every bit as dominating as Arroyo’s saber-arts had been!
The reason why Ning had been able to so easily defeat Arroyo was
primarily because he was being reinforced by the azureflower mist
energy. If it hadn’t been for his overwhelming advantage in speed
and strength, and if he had to rely on just his sword-arts, there was
no way he would’ve been able to defeat Arroyo’s saber-arts in
such a way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!” The
golden-robed emperor took another step forward, once more striking
out with that towering, majestic broadsword. His sword-light flashed
brilliantly, and it seemed as though nothing could stop this strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Frostice
sword in Ning’s hands suddenly transformed into a black hole,
seeking to ablate the power of the enemy’s strike and then defeat
it. However, Ning could sense that his opponent’s sword was so
dominating and forceful that there was no way he could shake it at
all. Instead, it was his own Soleheart stance which was broken. Once
more, Ning was sent flying back by the force of the collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was getting
absolutely mauled in this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The truth of the matter
was, in terms of raw sword-arts Ning wasn’t quite at the level of
master-class World Gods. Even though he did have the [Nameless]
sword-art and the [Quintessence Sword-Intent], he was just barely on
the same level as the Starlord of Fogstone. He was far from being a
match for this trial which Emperor Mirrorsnow had left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a truly dazzlingly
talented figure would be qualified to become the personal disciple of
Emperor Mirrorsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
emperor within the first estate-world had incredibly profound
sword-arts. Most likely, even Arroyo’s saber-arts were slightly
less mature in comparison. Arroyo had died shortly after making his
breakthrough upon the Samsara Grinders, after all; he didn’t really
have enough time to stabilize and build upon his gains. This
golden-robed emperor’s sword-arts were finely perfected and
absolutely flawless. They truly had reached a level of immaculate
perfection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful!” Ning emerged from the first estate-world, a look of
delight on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this last
battle, he had been sent flying into the walls, stone pillars, gates,
and staircase more than sixty times. However, Ning felt nothing but
pure joy. He had spent three thousand years meditating in the Hall of
Sword, but he was in bad need of actual combat experience! No matter
how much time you spent in meditation and training, if you didn’t
have any actual combat experience you would always have flaws in your
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the world of the
Mirrorsnow Painting, Ning was given an opponent who had essentially
reached the apex of World-level sword-arts. This battle had given
Ning a clear picture of the many flaws which existed in his
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I’m unable
to become Emperor Mirrorsnow’s disciple, the mere fact that I now
have an incredible expert in the Dao of the Sword who will spar
against me whenever I wish is of incalculable value.” Of course
Ning was delighted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look
at the third estate-world.” Ning pulled out the painting that he
had acquired from the Windsource Ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the world
of the painting. He found himself in a world with a beautiful
mountain, a waterfall which seemed to descend from the heavens
themselves, and beautiful creeks that swirled next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately saw
the gray-robed fisherman located off in the distance. The fisherman
simply sat there fishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, a new
World-level cultivator.” The fisherman rose to his feet in a
leisurely way, then said calmly, “I have been waiting here on the
orders of the Eternal Emperor. You are not permitted to use Immortal
energy, divine power, divine abilities, or secret arts. I will use
the same amount of strength as you possess in a swordplay
competition.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then come.” The
fisherman’s fishing rod suddenly shrank to become merely three feet
long, and he pointed it straight at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was utterly
trampled and demolished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fisherman within
the third estate-world was incredible. His sword-arts were like the
clouds in the sky, completely unpredictable in their movements and
transformations. The power of his sword-arts seemed to be utterly
inexhaustible as well as he sent out one strike after another. Ning
was confident in his defensive abilities, but in the end he was
simply unable to defend against the fisherman’s attacks. He ended
up getting whacked in the face quite a few times by that fishing rod,
and was smashed into the ground each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
golden-robed emperor’s sword had knocked Ning flying backwards,
Ning was still able to use his sword to block against those attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fisherman’s
sword… Ning was actually unable to withstand it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that the
fisherman and the golden-robed emperor each used different types of
sword-arts, but were more or less on par with each other. The
golden-robed emperor’s sword-arts were more regal, upright, and
just, and his attacks were filled with enormous power. The
fisherman’s sword-arts, by contrast, were more mysterious and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice, nice, nice!
Only by battling many experts who use the sword in different ways
will I get a better picture of the flaws that exist in my own
sword-arts.” Ning was actually ecstatic at the beating he had just
taken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth,
Ning became even more obsessed with meditating on his sword-arts. He
battled against these two experts of the sword repeatedly,
discovering many weaknesses in his own sword-arts and finding many
areas for improvement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many insights into
the Dao of the Sword which Ning had gained in the Hall of Swords were
now finally transforming into true power. His sword-arts continuously
improved with each sparring session, becoming more and more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meditation and actual
combat - the two went hand in hand. Both were necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than ten years passed here in the Badlands Court. World God
Dragonbinder had returned from the Allgod Estate as well, and the
first thing he did upon returning was to go speak to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
when I sensed the chaos energy fluctuating within the Allgod Estate I
simply knew it had to be you making your breakthrough.” When World
God Dragonbinder saw Ning, he felt absolutely delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two spent some time
dining and chatting together. Ning had gained many things from this
trip to the Allgod Estate, but so too had World God Dragonbinder. In
fact, he now had a vague idea as to what his path through Samsara
would be. Alas, it was still nothing more than a vague idea. To
actually tread that path and become a Samsara Daolord would be very,
very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it was
definitely an improvement. If he couldn’t even see or sense his
path, how could he have any hope of walking it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six more years went
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixteen years after
Ning’s return to the Badlands Court, a Samsara Daolord came to pay
a visit to the Badlands Court.

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands and
his wife were seated opposite a cyclopean man with a single horn on
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that you would be assigned to personally escort this mission, big
brother Fusu.” Daolord Badlands smiled as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was planning to
visit the Triclopean Thundersea anyhow, which was why the Dao
Alliance asked me to help escort these treasures.” Daolord Fusu
smiled. “The treasures you requested included the [Golden Idol]
divine ability, a few Eternal weapons that are merely middle-grade,
and the Mirrorsnow Painting. I imagine you must be purchasing them
for one of your disciples, yes? You know, you really should make them
go out and seek their fortunes. No matter how much you favor a
disciple, you can’t spoil him to this extent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Fusu,
you think too highly of me. How could I possibly be willing to spend
this much money just to help one disciple?” Daolord Badlands shook
his head. “You’ll have to forgive me for not being at liberty to
disclose the reason why I have requested these items.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Daolord
Fusu dropped this line of conversation. He let out a laugh. “Oh,
right. I heard that old man Solesky of Vastheaven Palace has begun to
furiously scour the realms for important treasures. He’ll be
planning to start his Daomerge soon. I heard that he’s actually
come to your Badlands Territory. He probably went to Waveshift world,
right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord
Badlands nodded. This was no secret. Many Samsara Daolords had
already guessed at the truth, and a little bit of divination would be
enough to show that this very likely the case.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That old fellow is
finally willing to start his Daomerge.” Daolord Fusu let out a
sigh. “Still, it makes sense. Their Vastheaven Palace has just
given birth to a new Samsara Daolord, and Daolord Warlord has reached
the fourth step as well. Even if old man Solesky fails his Daomerge,
he’ll still be able to protect Vastheaven Palace for a period of
time before he perishes and his Dao vanishes. Vastheaven Palace will
be able to grow considerably more powerful during this timeframe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands nodded
slowly. When one failed in the Daomerge, one’s truesoul would
slowly begin to dissipate. However, given how formidable Daolords who
were at the Verge of the Daomerge generally were, it would generally
take an extremely long period of time for the truesoul to actually
crumble away. It must be understood that even World God Northrest was
able to endure for nearly a full chaos cycle before he truly died
from the crumbling of his truesoul. Those ancient powers who were at
the Verge would be able to last much longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if they
went crazy and started attacking everyone around them, they would die
much more quickly. Still… Daolords who had failed their Daomerge
were destined to die, which make them incredibly fearsome foes to
face. Some would engage in wild massacres and do things which they
normally wouldn’t have dared to do, for whatever reason. Who would
dare to antagonize madmen like them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I envy him. I wonder
how long it will be before I, too, can set my burdens aside and go to
my Daomerge?” Daolord Fusu sighed. “My entire race’s prosperity
rests upon my shoulders. Although my race does have another Samsara
Daolord, he’s still at the first step despite an entire chaos cycle
having gone by since his ascension. He still hasn’t been able to
reach the second step. I fear that his potential is limited and that
he won’t have the power to protect our race.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Fusu,
perhaps you will make a sudden breakthrough that will allow you to
naturally and easily succeed in your Daomerge. When that happens, you
will gain eternity,” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gain eternity? The
number of Eternal Emperors in the entire Dao Alliance can be counted
on two hands.” Daolord Fusu shook his head. “Enough of that. Let
me give you the treasures which I escorted here. The price the Dao
Alliance requested was a total of 1.81 million cubes of chaos
nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.81 million cubes?”
Daolord Badlands nodded. Chaos nectar instantly began to flow out of
his estate-world, automatically separating themselves into a total of
1.81 million cubes before flying towards Daolord Fusu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fusu left that
very day as he headed off to the Triclopean Thundersea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late that night,
Daolord Badlands paid a personal visit to the Water Curtain Home to
visit Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord.” Ning was
shocked. “Daolord, if there’s anything you need, all you had to
do was have someone send word to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve pretty much
finished the process of finding those treasures you sought,”
Daolord Badlands said. “I have the [Golden Idol], an Elementum
Waterflame Gourd, and five Violetjewels. The Mirrorsnow Paintings
were a bit harder to find, as very few are willing to sell them once
acquired. I was only able to buy a copy of the second painting for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more than
enough!” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had predicted
early on that most Violetjewels had probably fallen into the hands of
Samsara Daolords. To them, being able to sell a middle-grade Eternal
weapon for nearly two hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar was an
absolutely wonderful bargain. They would easily be able to purchase
another powerful sword as well as other treasures they needed. Ning
wasn’t surprised at all that they had been able to find the five
copies that he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the Mirrorsnow
Painting was different. It was generally in the hands of World-level
cultivators, and to those cultivators the paintings represented a
priceless opportunity. Very few would be willing to sell off an
opportunity to become a personal disciple of an Eternal Emperor. In
fact, the Dao Alliance wasn’t even sure as to who was in possession
of most of the paintings, as most World-level cultivators would keep
their ownership secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we just round it
off, the total cost is roughly 1.8 million cubes,” Daolord Badlands
said. “I already gave you a million cubes previously. Let me give
you another two hundred thousand cubes now, as well as these
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daolord Badlands
spoke, he handed Ning a smooth disc of jade that held an estate-world
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior.”
Ning was very grateful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Idol] had
cost two hundred thousand cubes while the Elementum Waterflame Gourd
had cost five hundred thousand cubes. Daolord Badlands had been very
clear about the price of these items, and so the total cost was
around seven hundred thousand cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words, the
Mirrorsnow Painting and the five Violetjewels cost a total of 1.1
million cubes. Ning was actually quite happy with this price.
Honestly, even if Daolord Badlands upped the cost a little bit, Ning
wouldn’t have been able to find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private study.
The six Violetjewels were all placed atop a desk, and they each
emanated absolutely identical auras of sharpness and bloodlust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six Violetjewels.”
Ning nodded slightly. They would be of enormous use to him and make
him stronger. “With these six swords, I’ll be several times more
powerful than I currently am. I should be able to give a decent fight
to a Samsara Daolord of the First Step. Even if I can’t beat them,
I should still be strong enough to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had battled
against the fisherman in the third estate-world of the Mirrorsnow
Painting, he had eventually been unable to defend against the
fisherman’s rod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning knew that
one of the main reasons for this was that he had only been using a
single sword. If he had six swords… it could be said that he could
defend against even sixteen swords, preventing them from landing
attacks upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With just a single
sword, Ning had been able to create an almost airtight defense. With
six swords working in unison, it would be as though he was surrounded
and protected by enormous bucklers. Given Ning’s absolute control
over the Soleheart stance, he would have no flaws in his defenses at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Elementum
Waterflame Gourd.” A gourd suddenly appeared out of nowhere in
front of Ning. This was a red-black gourd which saw black lines
intertwining and mixing together with red lines on the surface of the
gourd, making it look mysterious and beautiful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning bound the
treasure, he was immediately able to sense the explosive, terrifying
power of the Dao lightning within it. The two types of Dao lightning
within the gourd were the Watersmoke Lightning and the Firecloud
Lightning. Both were filled with absolute savagery, and it made
sense. All lightning was explosive and aggressive by nature, making
them incredibly difficult to control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really will be
thousands of times more difficult to refine them than the chaos
lightning.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look
at the lower portion of the [Golden Idol].” Ning picked up a jade
slip then sent his divine power into it. He could immediately sense
the lifeblood oath covering the technique, as well as the various
rules and regulations which the Dao Alliance had set down. Ning
carefully read through everything. Once he decided there were no
problems, he immediately swore the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
information regarding the lower portion of the [Golden Idol] began to
fill Ning’s mind…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to
leave?” Daolord Badlands looked at Ning, who had come to pay
respects to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior needs to
return to Vastheaven Palace,” Ning said. “I regret having
disturbed you so often in recent days, Daolord. This junior will
definitely remember all the assistance you provided.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Sooner or later,
you do indeed have to return to Vastheaven Palace. However, to go
from my Badlands Territory to the Vastheaven Territory is an
extremely long journey, and you will encounter quite a few dangers
and ancient powers on the way. It is difficult for me to divine
exactly what you shall encounter on this journey.” Daolord Badlands
shook his head. “Just remember one thing: caution above all else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior
understands.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace was
very, very far away from the Badlands Territory, and the journey was
quite a perilous one. Even World-level cultivators would find such a
sojourn to be filled with dangers. Still, Ning felt confident that he
wasn’t too much weaker than most Samsara Daolords of the First
Step, which meant that he should at least be strong enough to keep
himself safe and survive the trip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then.” Daolord
Badlands nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A reflective look was
in Daolord Badlands eyes as he stared at Ning’s back as Ning left.
“According to what Dragonbinder said, when Ji Ning was an Elder God
he was capable of matching master-class World Gods in power. He can
be considered a freakishly talented figure. Still… the path of
cultivation is a path filled with countless dangers. I wonder how far
he will make it on his path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Freakishly talented?
That didn’t count for much. Daolord Badlands himself was a
freakishly talented figure, and over the course of many chaos cycles
he had seen quite a few other freakishly talented figures as well.
However, the vast majority of them ended up dying on their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning was his own
disciple he probably would’ve been willing to pay almost any price,
up to and including suffering severe injuries, in order to carefully
divine what would happen to Ning on this journey. However, Ji Ning
was just a disciple of Vastheaven Palace. There was naturally no
reason for Daolord Badlands to act in such a selfless manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spacetime transfer
array of the Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, we’ll go to
the Azuresky Territory.” Ning led Su Youji into the transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two are
requesting for the array to be activated just for them?” The Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals responsible for protecting the array
were all secretly speechless. The distance from here to the Azuresky
Territory was incredibly vast. The cost of activating the array just
for the two of them wouldn’t’ be a mere hundred bottles; it would
be a full cube of chaos nectar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning truly
didn’t care about the cost. Going from the Badlands Territory to
the Vastheaven Territory would at most cost him roughly a thousand
cubes of chaos nectar! There were also many places where there were
no connecting spacetime transfer arrays. He would have to personally
fly to the closest array, often through many dangerous regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands
Territory…” Su Youji stared towards the outside of the array. “So
I, Su Youji, am actually going to have a chance to see and explore
other territories.” Being powerful enough to voyage through other
territories was a testament to her strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands
Territory!” Ning stared at the skies far above them. This was the
place where he had gotten his first start after departing from the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime began to
twist and distort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire array began
to shine with blinding light as it tore through the fabric of space
and time, teleporting the two of them to a distant place in the
spacetime continuum. When the light faded away, the two figures had
vanished from within the array.
</P>

Chapter 19 - Trifount Planet
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than ninety-two
years went by in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Qianyun Territory
was a place that was incredibly far away from the Badlands Territory.
Trifount was one of the planets located within this territory, and it
was one of the core planets that were part of a local spacetime
transfer array. The spacetime transfer array was gleaming with light
as it twisted and distorted spacetime. Moments later, two figures
suddenly appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first figure was a
white-robed youth who was carrying a sword on his back. The second
was a fiery-robed woman. The two were Ji Ning and Su Youji, who had
travelled here all the way from the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trifount.” Ning
and Su Youji both emerged from the formation and stared off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive geyser of
water could be seen off in the distance, blasting a fountain of water
thirty thousand meters into the air. The stars glittered in the skies
above them, causing the water to sparkle with rainbow light. This
planet was constructed in a strange way, resulting in three enormous
geysers that blasted mountain-sized fountains of water high up into
the air. This was the reason why the planet was known as Trifount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We finally reached
Trifount.” Su Youji had a rather solemn look on her face. “Master,
our next destination will be the most dangerous place in our journey;
the Sea of Darkness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Once we pass
the Sea of Darkness, we won’t be too far away from Vastheaven
Palace.” Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninety-two years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji had
travelled through many different territories, some of which they had
to fly through or teleport their way through! This was why it had
taken them so long. They had encountered a number of dangerous
situations along the way, including some deadly environments as well
as cultivators who had sought to waylay and kill them. However, none
of these situations had truly been troublesome for the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They dared to ambush Ji
Ning? They truly had been courting death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most dangerous
part of the journey from the Badlands Territory to the Vastheaven
Territory is the passage through the Sea of Darkness.” Ning and Su
Youji were standing alongside each other atop a tall mountain,
staring off towards the distant void of space. Ning said, “Given
how fast we travel… I expect it will take us eight centuries to go
through the entire Sea of Darkness!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, three streaks
of light flew towards them from afar. They soon arrived before Ning
and Su Youji, the streaks of light transforming into three
cultivators who emanated auras of tremendous power. There were two
men and one woman, but all three had World-level auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.”
The leader of the three, a fairly muscular man, walked over with a
smile on his face. “Have you come to Trifount for the sake of
passing through the Sea of Darkness?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded,
not denying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man
smiled. “My name is Xiang Lu. He is World God Windgrace while she
is Chaos Immortal Waterswell.” The handsome, violet-robed man next
to him nodded towards Ning and Su Youji. “Windgrace greets you,
fellow Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterswell greets
you, fellow Daoists.” The female Chaos Immortal was just as
attractive as Windgrace, and her aura was even more charming than Su
Youji’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji could be
described as flickering flame, filled with alluring magnetism. This
Chaos Immortal named Waterswell, however, was like a pool of gentle,
soft water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth. She
is the Flamefairy.” Ning introduced their side as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth. Fellow Daoist Flamefairy.” The muscular man said, “We
saw you two appear within the spacetime transfer array from afar.
When we noticed how you two decided to stay here, we had a suspicion
that you might be planning to travel through the Sea of Darkness. I
imagine both of you know exactly how dangerous the Sea of Darkness
is, and the journey is an extremely long one as well. Given how long
and how dangerous the journey is, for a small group of just four or
five World-level cultivators to try to pass through it by themselves
is an extremely risky and difficult endeavor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji both
nodded. It was true. It would indeed be very dangerous! There were
many dangers on the path from the Badlands Territory to the
Vastheaven Territory, but the Sea of Darkness was the most dangerous
place of them all! Even someone as powerful as Ji Ning wouldn’t
dare to claim 100% confidence in navigating the place successfully.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is why those of
us who wish to traverse the Sea of Darkness will generally join
together into a group before venturing forth.” The muscular man
laughed. “Our current plan is to wait until we have a total of
ninety-nine World-level fellow Daoists, so that we can join together
into a formation if necessary. Once we have enough people, we will
head into the Sea of Darkness. We already have more than eighty
fellow Daoists, and the three of us have come to ask the two of you
to join us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety-nine?” Ning
and Su Youji exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. When
we have enough people, all of us will swear a simple lifeblood oath
that we are absolutely not permitted to attack any of our fellow
travelers,” the muscular man said. “With ninety-nine of us
working together, we will have a better than 90% chance of traversing
the Sea of Darkness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed with this
assessment. Ninety-nine! Given how many World-level cultivators would
be gathered here, some would most likely be supreme World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they all joined
together into a formation and were able to support each other, those
supreme World Gods would be comparable to Arroyo in strength! The
others wouldn’t be too weak either. Once they all fought together,
it was likely that even Samsara Daolords of the First Step would have
to stay away from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning nodded
and smiled. “Just now, the two of us were worrying about how we
were going to safely traverse the Sea of Darkness. It would indeed be
much safer for us if we can work together alongside so many fellow
Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Waterswell,
please lead these two fellow Daoists to the others,” the muscular
man instructed. He then looked at Ning. “Brother Windgrace and I
will have to stay here and keep an eye out for any other World-level
cultivators who we can invite to join us. Sorry for being unable to
send you off personally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning and
Su Youji followed Chaos Immortal Waterswell and flew off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our many fellow
Daoists are all located close to this place.” After flying for just
a short period of time, they reached a flat grassland. There were
quite a few World-level cultivators here clustered into small groups
of two or three people. A total of eighty-three cultivators were
located on this plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
rest here for now. We’ll head out once we reach a total of
ninety-nine cultivators. I’m going to go back now and wait
alongside big brother Xiang Lu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although quite a few
World-level cultivators had been gathered here, only twenty or thirty
percent of them belonged to the Qianyun Territory. The others were
all from nearby territories, with very few being from places as far
away as the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the people here
didn’t know each other, nor did they need to know each other. After
passing through the Sea of Darkness, they would all go their separate
ways. Thus, they all stayed clustered in small groups of two or
three, not really fraternizing with the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just wait,
then.” Ning and Su Youji sat down in the lotus position, waiting
silently while drinking some Immortal nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While waiting, Ning
continuously sent out a small amount of his divine power to create
incarnations which he sent into the Mirrorsnow Painting. He
repeatedly challenged the expert swordsmen within the three
estate-worlds using his incarnations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
emperor. The fisherman. The assassin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When dueling, these
three would use the exact same amount of power as Ning. It was merely
a contest of swordplay, and so Ning could simply use incarnations of
divine power to carry out the sparring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning’s true
body? Ning spent his attention on training in the [Golden Idol].
Initially, Ning immediately used three hundred cubes worth of chaos
gems to upgrade his body to the Dao weapon level. After that, he
began to simply train slowly in the technique, using just a small
amount of chaos gems as he did so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To upgrade his body and
make it comparable to top-grade Dao weapons would require an
extremely long period of time. Ning was in no rush. It was fine to
take it slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, they only
had to wait eleven years at Trifount before the total number of
World-level cultivators reached ninety-nine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoists.”
World God Xiang Lu smiled as he looked at the ninety-plus cultivators
on the plains. “We’ve already gathered a total of ninety-nine
World-level cultivators. It is time for us to head off into the Sea
of the Darkness. Here are the formation-discs. Each cultivator can
simply bind a single formation-disc.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of ninety-eight
discs of light appeared before him, then flew towards the other
World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an extremely
simple formation. You’ll know once you take a look at it.” World
God Xiang Lu smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted a
formation disc. After sending his power into it, he quickly
understood that this was indeed a very simple formation. It merged
all the energy of the cultivators into one mass, making it so that
all the cultivators were reinforcing and supporting each other. They
would all be much more powerful as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were actually
many formations that were more powerful than this one, but none of
the World-level cultivators here really knew each other or trusted
each other. It was precisely because this formation was so simple
that everyone had no suspicions regarding it and were willing to use
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the cultivators
bound the formation-discs, streams of light began to surge into the
skies. The ninety-nine streams of light connected with each other,
and all of the cultivators were blessed with the strength and power
of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety-nine
World-level cultivators simultaneously sent their Immortal energies
into the oathstone they were surrounding. As they all swore the
lifeblood oaths, they could sense the oaths of the others taking
effect as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the oaths were
identical. So long as they were in the Sea of Darkness, they were
absolutely not permitted to launch attacks against their comrades. If
the oath was violated, the assaulted party wouldn’t even need to
fight back; the lifeblood oath itself would ensure that the
violator’s truesoul was destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the oaths were
sworn, the cultivators all grew noticeably friendlier towards each
other. There was now at least an element of trust amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Poisonfeather. This flying vessel of mine is a top-grade Dao treasure
that is specialized for long-distance flying. It should be quite
suitable for traversing through the Sea of Darkness.” A bald,
silver-eyed man suddenly spoke out. “We can ride it together! If
anyone has any better flying treasures, we can use that instead.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the cultivators
all decided to use Daoist Poisonfeather’s ship for their journey
through the Sea of Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s head out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety-nine
cultivators all boarded the ship, keeping the formation active as
they departed from Trifount and headed off towards the Sea of
Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. Poisonfeather’s
name is actually ‘Flying Zhen’, with ‘Zhen’ being a Chinese
mythological beast that is often called the ‘Poisonfeather Bird’,
for self-explanatory reasons.  ↩

Chapter 20 - The Sea of Darkness
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel was
three thousand meters long, completely black, and was shaped like a
weaver’s shuttle. It continuously advanced through the dark void of
space towards the vast sea before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning wished to
reach Vastheaven Palace, he absolutely had to pass through the Sea of
Darkness! If he went around it, it would result in an incredibly long
detour. What’s more, the map which Daolord Solesky had given Ning
didn’t even specify the details to any such detour, instead simply
telling him to go straight through the sea. This was because this was
actually the safest option; the other options were even more
dangerous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was safer
by comparison, it was still a rather dangerous trip for World-level
cultivators. If they weren’t careful, they would easily die in this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
reasons why very few World-level cultivators would embark on such
long journeys! When Ning had been in the Badlands Territory, he had
queried the Starlord of Fogstone regarding the location of Vastheaven
Palace, but neither the Starlord nor his subordinates had even heard
of it. This was because the distance between the two territories was
utterly enormous. Even the Badlands Court, the most powerful
organization within the Badlands Territory, only held a few
cultivators who were aware of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll reach the
Sea of Darkness soon,” Ning sent mentally. “I recommend you go
into the golem now. Don’t stray too far from my side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know my own
limits, Master.” Su Youji was quite excited. “The legendary Sea
of Darkness. Actually, I’ve never even heard of it before this! To
think that I’m going to be going into it just a short while from
now. Wow. This trip from the Badlands Territory to the Vastheaven
Territory will give me something to brag about for many, many years
to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled, then
closed his eyes and focused on attuning to the sword-intent of his
Violetjewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was attuned to its
sword-intent at all times as he continuously meditated on the Dao of
the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
continuously teleported through the emptiness of space. Roughly a day
later, they finally arrived at the borders of the Sea of Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire vessel was
completely silent as all ninety-nine cultivators stared at the
distant sea of spatial chaos. Even here, at the mere borders of the
sea, they could sense the spatial waves crashing against their flying
vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” World
God Xiang Lu spoke out. The other cultivators turned their gazes from
the Sea to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
fellow Daoist Poisonfeather said, although this vessel is fast, it’ll
still take over six hundred years to go through the Sea of Darkness.
During these six hundred years, we’ll be in a state of constant
danger. Thus, if anything happens I would like to ask that the more
powerful experts among us to hold back. Please help out our weaker
fellow Daoists. Once one of us dies, the formation will be
dramatically weakened as well. The more of us die, the weaker the
formation will be, making it even more difficult for us to safely
traverse the Sea of Darkness,” World God Xiang Lu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since we are all on
the same ship, we should all support and help each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists, I
hope all of us will be able to make it safely through this Sea of
Darkness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators aboard
the vessel were all quite nervous. This was the Sea of Darkness,
after all. Most likely, few to none of them would dare to traverse
this place all by themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he watched
quite calmly from his little corner. His original plan had been to
venture into the Sea of Darkness alongside Su Youji, but that would
have indeed been rather dangerous. Now that ninety-nine World-level
cultivators had joined forces, if nothing went awry they would stand
at least a ninety-plus percent chance of successfully traversing the
Sea. If you factored in Ning’s true level of power, it could be
said that they were virtually guaranteed to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pitch-black vessel
flew forward at high speed, smashing straight into the Sea of
Darkness. It continuously sped up as it flew forward, quickly
breaking past the limits of the Heavenly Daos and continuing to
skyrocket in speed. Soon, it reached a level of speed that was
roughly double the speed of light. This was the vessel’s limit, and
it began to cruise forward at this speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Dark, turbulent waves of distorted chaos and space repeatedly crashed
the sides of the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the ninety-nine
cultivators, they all stared intently at their surroundings. Even
Ning elected to draw Violetjewel from its sheath on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a nervous
feeling.” Su Youji stared at her surroundings as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World Gods and
Chaos Immortals present were all extraordinary figures with
extraordinary vision. Take Ji Ning, for instance. Even when he merely
relied on his eyes, his current visual acuity far surpassed the level
he was at back when he was an Empyrean God who used the [Torch
Dragon’s Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to be so
worried, everyone. I’ve been through the Sea of Darkness before.”
A pudgy, fat-faced, chubby-eared youth next to Ning let out a merry
chuckle. “The most dangerous race of creatures here in the Sea of
Darkness is the race of ‘Oddbats’, but they live in groups deep
within the Sea of Darkness. Based on my previous experience, we’ll
generally suffer just one attack every four or five days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YIIIIII!” An
ear-piercing screech suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange beast that
was pitch-black in color and had a pair of bat-like wings suddenly
emerged out of nowhere from the spatial waves. It brandished its
fierce claws as it charged straight towards one of the cultivators
atop the vessel. Fortunately, that cultivator had been keeping a
vigilant watch and immediately struck out with his enormous greataxe,
the power of his blow causing space around him to congeal and turn
almost solid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One strange creature
after began to emerge from the spatial waves, all having bat-like
wings, incredibly sharp spear-like tails, and fierce claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oddbats!” Ning was
wielding Violetjewel, while Su Youji had already entered her golem.
She was able to control it at the same time as she controlled the
many blade-like magic treasures around her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill!” One
of the Oddbats flew onto the vessel and pounced straight towards
Ning. Ning struck out with Violetjewel, transforming it into a streak
of graceful sword-light that chopped straight towards the Oddbat’s
neck. However, the Oddbat used its left claw to gracefully deflect
the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword clashed
against the claw, a clanking sound was heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
star map records I read pertaining to the Sea of Darkness, these
Oddbat creatures have incredibly tough tails and claws, which are the
hardest parts on their bodies and equivalent to Dao weapons. It seems
this really is the case.” Still, Ning simply spun his sword-light
in a relaxed, graceful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! How could a dumb
creature such as an Oddbat possibly be able to defend against Ning’s
marvelous sword-arts? The sword chopped straight through the Oddbat’s
neck, severing its head from the rest of its body. Moments later, the
Oddbat’s body began to completely break apart, leaving nothing
behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oddbats…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were unique
creatures that were formed from the unique environs of the Sea of
Darkness. They possessed extremely low levels of intelligence, and
they usually lived for only shockingly brief periods of time.
Although they had World-level power, they lived for less than three
centuries. Once three centuries passed, their bodies would naturally
disintegrate and leave nothing behind. The only way for them to live
longer was for them to undergo a fundamental evolution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be said that
there were three tiers of Oddbats. There were the black Oddbats, the
silver Oddbats, and the golden Oddbats. The black Oddbats only lived
for less than three centuries, the silver Oddbats lived for less than
a chaos cycle, but the golden Oddbats could live forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, every part of
a golden Oddbat’s body was a precious treasure. Generally speaking,
when Samsara Daolords encountered them, they would immediately kill
them and collect the corpse! Thus, there were very few golden Oddbats
in the Sea of Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures flew
everywhere, as did sword-light, saber-light, and divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators aboard
the flying vessel all used the various techniques they had available
to quickly massacre any of the Oddbats who dared to invade their
vessel. After battling for a short period of time, the remaining
Oddbats all retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of Oddbats had
taken part in this battle, all of black-colored ones who were fairly
weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was certainly
easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We beat them pretty
easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I barely had a
chance to even fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The previously nervous
cultivators all glanced at each other. Many were now much more
relaxed than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were lucky this
time. We only encountered black Oddbats. If a silver Oddbat had come,
things would’ve been much more troublesome. I’ve heard that
silver Oddbats are very nearly comparable to transcendent World Gods
in power,” the chubby-faced youth chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ol’ brother
Ninehearts, can you please shut your yap? I don’t want to run into
one of those silver Oddbats.” An old man next to him who had a face
that looked like the withered bark of a dried tree shook his head
helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silver Oddbats are
nothing. According to the legends I heard, there are golden Oddbats
as well,” the chubby-faced youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was just as World
God Ninehearts said. Every four or five days, they would suffer an
attack. Every so often, a silver Oddbat would appear amongst the
ranks of the black Oddbats!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the ninety-nine
cultivators aboard the flying vessel were weak. Most were
master-class World-level cultivators, and there were at least three
supreme World-level cultivators! This was based on the amount of
power they had displayed thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single supreme
World-level cultivator, supported by the power of the formation, was
enough to contend against one of the silver Oddbats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is
strength in numbers.” Ning continued to relax in his corner of the
flying vessel. Thus far, he hadn’t even used any divine abilities,
much less the azureflower mist energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninety-nine World-level
cultivators fighting in unison truly made for a powerful force. There
was no need for Ning to fight too hard; they were able to easily
defeat the repeated attacks by the Oddbats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred and
eleven years passed after their entry into the Sea of Darkness. The
flying vessel continued to advance through the chaotic waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, brother
Darknorth. Drink with us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother
Poisonfeather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Yun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vessel was filled
with the sound of laughter. Everyone was drinking and chatting, but
they were also ready to engage in battle at a moment’s notice. They
had gotten accustomed to fighting every few days during the past
three centuries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battles had all
been quite easy. Most of the World-level cultivators on the ship,
Ning included, had yet to be forced to show their true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly ten trillion
kilometers away from them, in a region of chaotic space, an
incredibly dense cluster of black Oddbats and a few silver Oddbats
were ‘escorting’ a completely golden Oddbat. The golden Oddbat
spread out its golden wings just a bit, its intelligent eyes staring
at the distant flying vessel.

Chapter 21 - Ambushed
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything has been
verified?” The golden Oddbat spoke verbally, its shrill voice
reverberating in a strange manner that caused ripples to appear in
the already-chaotic space around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything has been
verified, your Highness. That flying vessel is indeed crewed by
World-level cultivators, and there are ninety-nine of them in total.”
A silver Oddbat responded respectfully to the query.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oddbats were extremely
dumb creatures, with the black ones only capable of calling out for
blood and mayhem. It was difficult for them to even form complete
sentences. However, once they evolved to become silver Oddbats they
would gain a much longer lifespan and a dramatically increased level
of intelligence. Silver Oddbats were at least comparable to ordinary
mortals in intelligence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety-nine
World-level cultivators?” The golden Oddbat stared coldly towards
the distant vessel. “They actually managed to mass such a large
number of cultivators? That probably means they don’t have any
Samsara Daolords amongst their ranks. Samsara Daolords wouldn’t
bother with waiting so long, they’d just go through by themselves.
Mm… since that’s the case, ehehe…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oddbats had a strange
fetish; they delighted in eating the flesh of cultivators. They could
even devour the incredibly tough bodies of most World Gods! So long
as those divine bodies had not reached the Dao weapon level, the
golden Oddbats would be able to crunch through them like candy. To
the golden Oddbats, cultivators were the finest delicacies in
existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was exacerbated by
the fact that Oddbats generally tended to be massacred in vast
numbers by travelers. Even their kings, the golden Oddbats, would
often find themselves killed by Samsara Daolords if they were
careless. Thus, the race of Oddbats harbored tremendous hatred for
cultivators in general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What luck. The Sea
of Darkness is such a vast place, but I actually managed to run into
a vessel of cultivators. Kill them, my children!” The golden Oddbat
let out a shrill shriek as it ordered, “Wipe out all the
cultivators on that vessel! Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The nine
silver Oddbats assented respectfully in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” “Yes!”
“Yes!” The many black Oddbats all cried out in a raucous chorus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dense cluster of
Oddbats all quickly passed through the spatial waves and flew towards
the distant flying vessel. The Oddbats were born from within the Sea
of Darkness and thus were born with the innate ability to conceal
themselves within the violent spatial tempests within the Sea. This
was the reason why they were able to fly close to the vessel without
being detected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sea of Darkness was
incredibly vast, but it had very few golden Oddbats within it. Even
though the vessel Ning’s group was in was incredibly fast, it would
still need more than six centuries to pass through the Sea. One could
imagine how utterly vast it was! This was why it was extremely rare
for a group to be unlucky enough to encounter a golden Oddbat. In
fact, dozens of squads would often pass through the Sea without a
single squad encountering one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, before we
entered the Sea of Darkness you frightened me half to death with the
stories about how dangerous this place is. Well? Look at how relaxed
we all are!” Su Youji was seated next to Ji Ning in a corner of the
vessel. The two were engaged in conversation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because you
have more than ninety other cultivators fighting alongside you,
helping you deal with those Oddbats. If the two us had to deal with
them all by ourselves, what do you think would happen?” Ning gave
her a sideways glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would happen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning was
strong, he was still just one person. He’d only be able to deal
with a portion of the Oddbats at any given point in time. Su Youji
would have to rely on her golem and the bugbeasts to fight against
them, but she’d still be in grave danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, now that
they had ninety-nine cultivators and a supportive formation, things
were completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I have to blame
someone, I’m going to blame you for not having sufficiently
detailed information,” Su Youji mumbled. “The awe-inspiringly,
inconceivably famous Daolord Nihilate failed in his Daomerge and is
now searching for a disciple. How is it that your intelligence
reports made no mention of such earth-shaking news?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but let out an involuntarily snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sea of Darkness was
an incredibly dangerous place. Although it was located next to the
Qianyun Territory, in normal times it was extremely rare for
cultivators to pass through the Sea, and they would only do so if
they had an extremely special reason for it. It would take a very
long period of time for ninety-nine World-level cultivators to be
gathered. In contrast, this time they had managed to reach this
figure in a very short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because of
something which had happened on the other end of the Sea of Darkness,
within the Jadesea Territory. A Samsara Daolord known as Daolord
Nihilate had failed in his Daomerge, then had publicly proclaimed
that he wished to take on a disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Nihilate was an
incredibly famous figure, especially in the surrounding territories.
However, he was a solitary figure with no sect and no disciples to
his name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had failed
in his Daomerge, he had suddenly realized that he didn’t have any
heirs at all. This was why he had chosen to accept a disciple.
Daolords who had failed in the Daomerge were all at least Verge-class
Daolords who were just as powerful as Daolord Solesky! If such a
powerful Daolord wished to take on a disciple, almost every
World-level cultivator would be willing to sacrifice almost anything
in order to become that disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this master
would undoubtedly die in the future, it was a fact that even a World
God like Northrest was able to survive for a full chaos cycle before
his truesoul faded away. So long as Daolord Nihilate didn’t go
crazy and engaged in repeated, frenzied battles, he would be able to
stay alive for an extremely long period of time. By the time he
passed away, his guidance probably would’ve resulted in his student
becoming a Samsara Daolord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More importantly… who
would dare to antagonize you if you had a master who had just failed
his Daomerge? It could be said that prior to your master dying, you
could do whatever you wished and be completely unchallenged. More
than 80% of the people on Ning’s vessel were heading to the Jadesea
Territory to try and take on Daolord Nihilate as their master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While travelling to
this place from the Badlands Territory, I heard quite a few legends
and stories about things that had happened in the ancient past. I
heard many stories about truly powerful Daolords who failed their
Daomerge, their Daos vanishing and their lives ending…” Ning
shook his head and sighed. “I really have heard of very few
Daolords who succeeded in their Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was worried about
Daolord Solesky. Although they hadn’t had many interactions with
each other, Daolord Solesky truly had treated Ning as he would a
brother. In the Windsource Ruins, Daolord Solesky had suffered severe
injuries but elected to go all-out in attempting to locate Ning
before even treating his own wounds. Only after he had located Ning
had he calmed down and started to heal himself. Ning had felt
tremendously moved by him when NIng saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YIIIIIII!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sudden, shocking,
high-pitched Oddbat shriek suddenly rang out. The cultivators who had
been chatting calmly amongst each other instantly took control of
their respective treasures and weapons, then started to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
flashed in Ning’s hands as he slew a black Oddbat. The creature’s
head went flying off, then the rest of its body dissipated into
nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning’s
face suddenly fell dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tight, dense cluster
of black Oddbats had appeared in the area around the vessel. There
were far more Oddbats this time than there had ever been in the past,
at least ten times more than the previous record! There had to be
thousands of the things. They all circled around the vessel, causing
it to slow down and eventually come to a full stop, unable to move
any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.’ Ning’s
body blurred as he manifested three heads and six arms. He now
wielded six Violetjewels in his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, everyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are nine of
those silver Oddbats.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation instantly
turned extremely grim as all the cultivators began to grow nervous.
It must be understood that every single silver Oddbat was comparable
to a transcendent World God in power. Even though the cultivators
were all supported by the power of their formation, they had to have
originally possessed the power of a supreme World God if they wished
to be able to give the silver Oddbats a good fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning’s
sword-light spun out in a beautiful arc, causing eight of the black
Oddbats around him to be annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, bind this
bugnest.” Ning immediately tossed a jade green globe to Su Youji.
As soon as she bound it, she would be in control of the fifty-one
bugbeasts stored within it. Given how ugly the situation was looking
and how many Oddbats were attacking, Ning was worried that he
wouldn’t be able to protect her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded. She wouldn’t decline or be polite at a time like this, and
she immediately bound the treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s too many
of these Oddbats!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there so
many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block that silver
Oddbat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wild battle was
occurring atop the flying vessel. Magic treasures flew everywhere
while World Gods charged to and fro.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me deal with
this silver Oddbat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll handle that
one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators on the
vessel had never experienced a truly dangerous situation during this
trip. Quite a few of them had therefore been hiding their true power.
Now, however, they had to reveal everything. There were actually more
than ten cultivators who had the power of supreme World Gods! It made
sense. If you wanted to become a disciple of Daolord Nihilate, you
had to have enough power to back up that goal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had transformed
into a ghostly blur, his swords becoming even more ephemeral and
unpredictable than before. They struck out lightning fast, causing
Oddbats to perish wherever they went. The Oddbats were completely
unable to defend against Ning’s terrifying sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past three
hundred-plus years, Ning had often sent incarnations of divine power
into the estate-worlds of the Mirrorsnow Paintings to challenge the
guardians. His sword-arts were now much more powerful than they had
been back in the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe out any Oddbats
that get near me.” Su Youji summoned her bugbeasts, calling out a
total of thirty of them to surround her and slay any Oddbats that
dared to draw near her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black Oddbats were
all quite weak, after all. These bugbeasts all had the power of
master-class World Gods; plenty strong enough to deal with Oddbats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators were
engaged in fierce battles throughout the entire vessel. As a result,
they were able to just barely hold their own against this assault by
the nine silver Oddbats and thousands of black Oddbats.

Chapter 22 - Golden Oddbat
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more black
Oddbats died as the battle progressed, resulting in the cultivators
relaxing slightly. Although the situation was still quite grim, they
were no longer under as much pressure as they were before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chubby, fat-faced
youth named World God Ninehearts suddenly turned his head to stare
off into the distance, his face turning pale. He immediately shouted
mentally to everyone, “Watch out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurry figure
suddenly appeared out of nowhere next to a tall, skinny World God who
was dressed in black armor. The World God was already engaged in
battle, but he hurriedly chopped out with the waraxe in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusory figure
suddenly seemed to wrap itself around the World God’s head. Crunch!
The head was bitten clean off. Only now did the other cultivators on
the vessel see that the creature which had bit off the head of the
World God was a golden Oddbat. The golden Oddbat’s wings were
spread out and its terrifying aura had completely enveloped the
entire vessel. It then swallowed down the rest of the World God’s
body into its tummy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golden Oddbat.”
The faces of all the cultivators present turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden Oddbats were
unique, legendary creatures of the Sea of Darkness. They were the
most terrifying creatures that could be found in the Sea! Silver
Oddbats were comparable to transcendent World Gods, while golden
Oddbats were comparable to Daolords of the First Step. Powerful
Samsara Daolords were able to easily slaughter golden Oddbats,
treating their body parts as valuable treasures, but World-level
cultivators viewed the golden Oddbats as utter nightmares. How many
World-level cultivators were able to battle against Daolords of the
First Step?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninety-eight
cultivators were still alive, but the death of that single cultivator
resulted in the strength of the formation dropping by nearly 30%! If
the ninety-eight cultivators worked together, they would be able to
withstand that golden Oddbat. The problem was that there were nine
silver Oddbats and thousands of black Oddbats attacking them as well.
The cultivators present simply didn’t have any excess capacity to
spare right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, everyone!
Hold on for as long as you can. Brother Ninehearts, brother Loopwise,
join me in fighting against that golden Oddbat. If we let it
slaughter the others, all of us are going to die.” The master of
the flying vessel, the bald silver-eyed World God Poisonfeather, sent
a hurried mental message to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God
Poisonfeather, World God Ninehearts, and World God Loopwise were the
supreme World Gods on the vessel who were not tied down in combat
against a silver Oddbat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave the other
Oddbats to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other cultivators
all gritted their teeth as they fought, doing their best to hold on
as long as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three supreme World
Gods Poisonfeather, Ninehearts, and Loopwise all transformed into
streaks of light as they flew straight towards that golden Oddbat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Oddbat
watched coldly as those three powerful cultivators charged towards
it. It was extremely confident in its own powers. It was capable of
avoiding the three, but why would it even see the need to avoid the
three?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were merely
World-level cultivators. In the golden Oddbat’s eyes, these
cultivators were nothing more than tasty snacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny cultivators…”
The golden Oddbat spread wide its golden, bat-like wings as the three
cultivators reached its side. Supported and empowered by the group
formation, they could be considered to have just barely reached the
transcendent World God level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Light.” World God
Poisonfeather had a solemn look on his face. He stabbed forward with
the pike in his hands, a spot of light appearing at its tip. The
surrounding area was completely plunged into darkness, leaving behind
only that single tip of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” World God
Loopwise complete transformed a savage, roaring wave of blood.
Flickers of saber-light could be seen flashing within this wave of
blood as it surged towards the golden Oddbat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t die,
who will?” The chubby, fat-faced youth World God Ninehearts struck
out with his longspear, causing spacetime to distort and fold in on
itself. It seemed as though there was no way for anyone to dodge this
spear no matter what.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were
amongst the most powerful cultivators on this vessel. Although the
other cultivators were furiously defending against the onslaught of
the other Oddbats, they were able to spare a little bit of attention
to watch this battle. When they saw these three killer moves being
unleashed, they couldn’t help but feel a hint of eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Oddbat
suddenly flapped its giant golden bat wings. As soon as its wings
moved, all of the chaotic spatial waves around it suddenly turned
still… and then, the golden Oddbat itself became the source of all
of the spatial waves in this area. Its flapping wings began to kick
up an enormous spatial tempest as the wings began to rapidly increase
in size, to the point where the wings seemed large enough to cover
the entire vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Poisonfeather’s
lance, Loopwise’s saber-light, Ninehearts’ longspear…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! A
series of explosions rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three World Gods
were knocked flying backwards. They slammed hard into the deck of the
ship, all three of them vomiting out blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can it be this
powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three supreme World
Gods, supported by our formation, aren’t even able to withstand a
single strike from it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety-plus
cultivators instantly felt their hearts freeze and their hopes
vanish. Apparently, those three supreme World Gods weren’t even
close to being a match for the golden Oddbat. Most likely, all of the
supreme World Gods on the vessel would have to join forces in order
to have a chance! Alas, the vessel was being assaulted by nine silver
Oddbats and the thousands of black Oddbats as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are finished.”
Some of the cultivators began to feel despair. They couldn’t come
up with any solutions for dealing with these foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
technique or their mastery of the Dao, those three are my equals.”
Ning had watched carefully as those three had charged forward. He had
actually followed right behind them, watching them test out the
golden Oddbat in the hopes that he could get a sense of how powerful
it truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as those
enormous bat-wings had flapped, the three World Gods had been knocked
flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned slightly
upon seeing this. He was quickly able to come to a series of
judgments. “So it really is true! Oddbats are all incredibly dumb
creatures. Even golden Oddbats are only talented in the Dao of Space
because of their incredible innate gifts in this Dao. Despite that,
their insights are only comparable to the insights of ordinary
World-level cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oddbats. The black
Oddbats had the intelligence level of ordinary human infants, and
they knew almost no combat techniques at all. They relied entirely on
their innate gifts to battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden Oddbats were far
more powerful, but their insights into the Dao were merely comparable
to the insights of ordinary World-level cultivators. They weren’t
even close to being a match for Ning and the others in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Its insights into
the Dao are quite ordinary! The problem is that it is incredibly fast
and possesses overwhelming physical power.” Ning’s eyelids
twitched slightly. “Its body is incredibly tough. No wonder
everyone says that the corpse of a golden Oddbat is a priceless
treasure. Its various parts can be used to forge Eternal weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The claws, fangs, and
tail of a golden Oddbat were all comparable to Eternal weapons. Its
other parts were slightly weaker but still formidable. For example,
its wings were soft but resilient, while its skin was quite smooth.
Its entire body was terrifyingly strong, granting it incredible speed
and strength. When it had flapped its enormous wings just now, it
actually hadn’t used any intricate techniques. It had relied on its
overwhelming superiority in strength to send those three cultivators
halfway to Hell!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivators are
truly useless.” The golden Oddbat spread out its enormous wings
once more as it stood there atop the flying vessel. It turned its
cold, insidious gaze towards the other cultivators on the boat. All
of the cultivators began to feel a sense of despair. What were they
going to do? How were they supposed to stop it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How boring. All of
you can go die now. Ahahaha…” The golden Oddbat let out an
ear-piercing laugh as it suddenly pounced towards the nearest
cultivator, who hurriedly beat a frantic retreat in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blinding streak of
sword-light suddenly pierced through the air towards the golden
Oddbat, colliding directly against the golden Oddbat’s sharp claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! The golden
Oddbat was brought to a momentary halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
couldn’t help but stumble backwards by three steps, each step so
heavy as to cause the entire vessel to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes narrowed
as he stared at the golden Oddbat. He was now supported by the
azureflower mist energy; with its energy supporting him, the
additional power granted by the formation was almost negligible.
“What terrifying strength. It is far stronger than I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Oddbat
stopped moving as it turned to stare at Ning, weighing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire vessel fell
silent. All the cultivators turned to focus on this sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had manifested
three heads and six arms and was wielding six swords. He and the
golden Oddbat were staring at each other intently from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Oddbat
continued to stare weighingly at Ning, then let out another one of
those ear-piercing laughs. Its voice echoed throughout the
surrounding void as it said, “I didn’t expect to find someone so
powerful here. You should be the most powerful person on this
vessel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s brother
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other cultivators
were overjoyed upon seeing this. They were stunned at the level of
power which Ning had just unleashed, but they were also filled with a
powerful urge and hope to stay alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it is useless.
You will still die.” The golden Oddbat let out that bizarre laugh.
“All the cultivators on this vessel will die!” As it laughed, it
transformed into a blur as it pounced straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning didn’t
back down in the slightest, charging straight forward with six
Violetjewels at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was like a streak
of light while the golden Oddbat was like an illusory blur. The two
instantly collided against each other! Ning possessed astonishing
speed and strength, but the golden Oddbat was superior to even Ning
in these two aspects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly
clashed dozens of times. No one dared to draw near the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! An enormous
explosion rang out as the golden tail and the sword-light both struck
the deck of the flying vessel at the same time, knocking it askew and
flipping it over. All of the cultivators and Oddbats were sent flying
out of the vessel. They all hurriedly moved to avoid Ji Ning and the
golden Oddbat, who had now truly begun to fight.

Chapter 23 - Terror
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree Ji Ning’s
Jindan chaos region was now more than ninety thousand meters tall.
His Sword World was incredibly powerful, and the six Violetjewels in
his hands were Eternal weapons of ridiculous power. Ning also had the
azureflower mist energy reinforcing him, making his body comparable
to that of a Daolord of the First Step, and yet…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was sent
staggering backwards, but his swordplay remained orderly. He stared
intently at the distant golden Oddbat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is simply too
physically strong.” Ning felt genuine amazement in his heart. “It
clearly has terrible combat techniques, but it is still able to
suppress me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Oddbat’s
wings were spread, but its gaze was turned towards the other
cultivators in the distance as it watched those ninety-plus
cultivators fight against its many children. The cultivators were
slowly gaining the upper hand as the number of black Oddbats began to
decline, causing the golden Oddbat to feel rather impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, I’ll let you
stay alive for a bit longer.” The golden Oddbat let out an
ear-piercing screech as it shot out in a solitary arc, seeking to
move past Ning and assault the other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety-plus
cultivators had all been paying attention to the battle between the
golden Oddbat and Ning. They were all shocked to see the golden
Oddbat head their way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew how
incredibly fast the golden Oddbat was. Previously, the golden Oddbat
had simply been so proud and arrogant that it had stood there without
moving, allowing those three World Gods to assault it. It had battled
against Ning for quite some time before it began to grow impatient.
It set aside its pride, intending to move around Ning and slay the
other cultivators instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No running!” Ning
let out a loud roar as the Thunderlight Wings suddenly appeared on
his back. The Thunderlight Wings fluttered slightly, causing his
speed to dramatically increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” A dazzling,
eye-catching streak of crimson-gold lightning suddenly shot out of
Ning’s forehead. This streak of crimson-gold lightning moved with
incredible speed, far faster than the golden Oddbat itself. The
lightning furiously smote the golden Oddbat with a direct blow! This
was one of the streaks of [Novessence Thunder] which Ning had
mastered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle! Hiss! The
crimson-gold lightning completely surrounded the golden Oddbat’s
body. The golden Oddbat was so powerful that it could completely
ignore the damage caused by the crimson-gold lightning, but the
lightning had a powerful restrictive effect on it. It was like a
supreme World God was doing everything he could to keep his arms
wrapped around it, causing the golden Oddbat’s movements to be
encumbered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incredibly
fast to begin with, his speed being comparable to that of ordinary
Daolords. Now that he was using his Thunderlight Wings, the two were
fairly close in speed. Given that golden Oddbat was being slowed down
by Ning’s [Novessence Thunder], Ning was immediately able to catch
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The golden
Oddbat was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done, brother
Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth truly is an admirable figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shouts of delight rang
out from afar, as well as some laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning caught up to
the golden Oddbat, his six Eternal weapons struck out like six
blood-colored wyrms as he furiously assaulted the creature, once more
stopping it in its tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, help me
out by getting rid of the other Oddbats as soon as possible,” Ning
called out laughingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Oddbats are
easy to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up, fellow
Daoists. It isn’t easy for brother Darknorth to fend off the golden
Oddbat!” The cultivators could now see hope, and so they did their
absolute best to wipe out the remaining Oddbats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
continued to battle against the golden Oddbat in single combat while
using the [Novessence Thunder] to bind it. The power of that
crimson-gold lightning was completely applied to the golden Oddbat’s
body, causing it to be slowed down slightly. Ning couldn’t help but
sigh in amazement at how tough its body was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were to use the
Elementum Waterflame Gourd and release the lightning it holds, it
would definitely release more power than my [Novessence Thunder]
possesses.” Ning couldn’t help but secretly sigh. “The problem
is that it would just be one level of power stronger. I would at most
have the upper hand but I still would find it difficult to actually
kill this golden Oddbat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elementum
Waterflame Gourd held two types of Dao lightning. Dao lightning was
capable of sweeping aside almost anyone below the Daolord level of
power! However, it was only capable of wiping out master-class World
Gods in one strike; it was at most just slightly stronger than the
[Novessence Thunder] which Ning had put such effort into creating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When these two types of
water-attribute and fire-attribute Dao lightning joined together,
they would be significantly stronger, most likely capable of slaying
supreme World Gods in one blow! They were capable of heavily injuring
transcendent World Gods and have a major restrictive effect on
Daolords of the First Step. Alas, the golden Oddbat was simply too
physically tough, and its claws, fangs, and tail were comparable to
Eternal weapons in might. Even its skin and its wings, some of its
weaker body parts, were comparable to Dao weapons. It would be
extremely difficult for Ning to injure it with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, the
Elementum Waterflame Gourd is an important treasure. I spent five
hundred and fifty thousand cubes of chaos nectar for it! If I was to
use it, everyone would be able to recognize it right away. Elementum
Waterflame Gourds are incredibly famous Eternal weapons. If they
recognize it… once these cultivators reach the other end of the Sea
of Darkness, word of it being in my possession will spread and I’ll
probably be in a lot of trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
currently on the same vessel, a treasure worth over half a million
cubes of chaos nectar was alluring for even many Samsara Daolords, to
say nothing of World-level cultivators. The reason why Ning had
purchased this treasure was to use it as a killer trump card! He
would only use it in dire situations, when his very life was at
stake. But of course, he also had it since he would need those two
types of Dao lightning when training in the second part of the
[Novessence Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, this is fun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to Ning tying
down the golden Oddbat, the other cultivators slowly began to gain
the upper hand as more and more Oddbats perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, just hold it off for a while longer. We’ll be ready to
reinforce you soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll be there
shortly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators began
to pick up the pace in killing the Oddbats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the golden
Oddbat, it let out a furious, ear-piercing screech. After having been
tied down for so long, it finally couldn’t take it any longer. It
roared furiously, “Let’s go, children! Let’s go! Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The golden Oddbat
flapped its massive wings, creating a terrifying spatial tempest as
it began to flee off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine silver Oddbats
and the few surviving black Oddbats all hastily fled as well, moving
at incredibly fast speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared as the
golden Oddbat disappeared into the distance. He didn’t try to chase
it. If he did, he would probably be surrounded and attacked by all of
the Oddbats! In addition, these Oddbats were born and bred here in
the Sea of Darkness. They knew it better than any cultivator. If Ning
really did give chase, he might well be led into and trapped within a
dangerous part of the Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is over.” Ning
let out a sigh of relief. Being able to force these Oddbats into
retreating was already an excellent outcome. Ning’s goal was to
reach Vastheaven Palace, after all. It wasn’t to kill a golden
Oddbat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the flying vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators had all
returned to the flying vessel, which once more began to accelerate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
it was all thanks to you that we made it. If it wasn’t for you, we
would probably all be dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m
embarrassed to say this, but all this time I felt certain that I was
one of the strongest cultivators on this vessel. Now, it seems,
brother Darknorth is capable of defeating me in a single blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We actually
encountered a transcendent World God on this trip, eh? This truly is
a rare occasion. Come, fellow Daoist Darknorth. Let me offer you a
toast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vessel was filled
with the sound of laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transcendent World
Gods, when supported by the power of their formation, would be
comparable to Daolords of the First Step. Thus, most of them felt
certain that Ning was a transcendent World God. What they didn’t
realize was that Ning’s own azureflower mist energy was actually
far stronger than their formation, which had provided him with just a
negligible amount of assistance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, of course,
wouldn’t tell them the truth. This was his secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without everyone
else helping out, I probably would’ve ended up dying after being
encircled by the golden Oddbat and thousands of other Oddbats.”
Ning also laughed as he chatted and drank with the other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spatial waves
within the Sea of Darkness remained as savage as ever. The
ninety-eight cultivators continued to fly through the Sea within
their vessel, chatting, drinking, and celebrating their victory. But
just at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
pitch-black opening suddenly appeared within the spatial waves around
them. The opening was over a million kilometers in size… and a head
slowly began to emerge from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This head was utterly
enormous, at least a million kilometers in size as well. Its two eyes
were like two enormous blazing suns, and it was staring right at the
flying vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The carousing
cultivators aboard the flying vessel all stared wide-eyed in horror,
as did Ning. They could feel their truesouls quivering in terror as
an incredible, indescribable sense of danger crashed down upon them.
This was a warning that the Destiny Sea was sending to them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The enormous
head opened its mouth, causing a pitch-black corridor of spacetime to
appear. All of the cultivators were instantly drawn inwards towards
its mouth. Ning was the strongest cultivator present, and he tried to
activate his Thunderlight Wings to escape, but even he found it
impossible to shake off that sucking effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire flying
vessel was swallowed into the spacetime corridor of darkness located
within the creature’s mouth, as were all ninety-eight cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime was in a
state of absolute flux within this dark corridor. Soon, the vessel
and all ninety-eight cultivators completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing, sun-sized
eyes of the titanic head swept the surrounding area with a glance,
then slowly shrank back into the enormous dark cavity from whence it
came. That enormous dark hole then vanished as well and the Sea of
Darkness once more returning to its regular appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the
ninety-eight cultivators and the flying vessel they had been in had
completely vanished from the Sea of Darkness.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A territory located
unfathomably far away from the Sea of Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous
rhombus-shaped gemstone was located atop a chaos star, emanating
ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to get closer
to it. I can still move a bit closer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a hundred
World-level cultivators had been gathered here atop this chaos star.
Their gazes blazed as they stared at the enormous rhombus jewel that
had been firmly planted into the ground off in the distance. The
ripples emanating from the jewel were being transmitted straight into
their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A karmic fortune has
been placed before me. I have to grasp it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can keep moving
closer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators were like children who had just started to learn how to
walk. Every single step they took was incredibly difficult, and the
closer they moved to it, the more invisible pressure was applied to
their very truesouls. Despite this, they continued to strive to move
closer to the rhombus so that they might more clearly hear the voice
that was hidden within those ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice was like the
voice of the Dao itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
pitch-black hole that was over a million kilometers in size suddenly
and silently opened above that chaos star. A titanic head slowly
emerged from within the hole, and it stared with its two blazing
sun-like eyes towards the cultivators below it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus
World-level cultivators were disturbed from their reverie. They had
been consumed by delight upon encountering this tremendous karmic
fortune, but they now all stared upwards in shock at the terrifying
head that had just appeared. Their truesouls were all shaking in
terror!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous head
opened its lips and inhaled, an enormous pitch-black spatial corridor
appearing within its mouth. The hundred-plus World-level cultivators
atop the chaos star were all drawn towards it, unable to resist its
power in the slightest. They were all sucked into the spatial
corridor, and even the rhombus jewel that had been planted onto the
star was drawn in as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gulp. The enormous head
shut its mouth, then retreated back into the pitch-black hole which
closed behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter stillness was
left behind in its wake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Gelian Territory.
This was one of the territories located beyond the control of the Dao
Alliance. The Aeonians were in control of this territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two beautifully dressed
major powers were striding through the chaos of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime twisted and
distorted around them. They seemed to be moving slowly, but each step
they took allowed them to travel a far greater distance than
World-level cultivators travelled through teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gorsch, you were
actually willing to let little Gorho become apprenticed to me? That
means if he becomes Awakened in the future, he’ll be considered at
least partially my subordinate.” A dazzling beautiful woman dressed
in long green robes chuckled merrily as she spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In all my years,
I’ve never seen any descendants of mine who have more potential
than Little Gorho. Although he is currently just a World-level
cultivator, I’ve raised him and taught him so that he is capable of
battling against Daolords of the First Step. And that’s not even
his limit! His greatest skill lies in the Dao of Spacetime… and you
are one of the top two masters of spacetime in our entire Aeonian
race. Only by apprenticing himself to you can he truly reach the
greatest heights possible in the Dao of Spacetime.” The
silver-haired, middle-aged man had a look of desire in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
continued, “The stronger one is prior to being Awakened, the more
they will benefit after their Awakening, and the more potential they
will have! I’ve watched as little Gorho grew up and taught him
step-by-step. It is true that as your disciple, he’ll be considered
as half your subordinate… but for the sake of his future growth, I
decided to let you take advantage of me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are making it
sound as though I’m taking huge advantage of you.” The
green-robed woman laughed. “I’ll have to spend a lot of effort in
teaching him, you know?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There aren’t many
of us Aeonians, and there are even fewer descendants with as much
potential as this child. Little Gorho can Awaken himself whenever he
wishes, but been intentionally suppressing himself. Don’t pretend
you haven’t won the lottery by gaining a disciple of such
potential,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s make things
clear from the get-go. Since he is going to be my disciple, I’m
going to keep him by my side for a full chaos cycle,” the
green-robed woman said. “You are not permitted to interfere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The
silver-haired man assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two chatted and
laughed as they strolled through the void of space, quickly reaching
a different chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh!?” The
green-haired woman’s face tightened. A speck of golden light
appeared in each of her eyes that shone down upon the surrounding
region of spacetime. A solemn look on her face, she immediately said,
“The spacetime in the surrounding area has been forcibly
distorted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forcibly distorted?”
The silver-haired man’s face tightened as well. He immediately sent
out his senses to scan the entire chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’s little
Gorho?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is he missing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
was stunned. “Why are even his servants… wait, even the
protectors of this chaosworld are missing?” According to the rules
he had set down, the protectors were absolutely forbidden from
leaving without his permission as this was an incredibly important
part of the territory of King Gorsch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, all of the
World-level cultivators had gone missing from this chaosworld,
including his most cherished descendant Gorho.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My subordinates
would never leave without my permission. Someone must’ve
slaughtered them or captured them.” Flames began to flicker around
the silver-haired man’s body, and his eyes became filled with a
murderous look. “If spacetime has been distorted here, we should be
able to trace the ripples of spacetime to locate the person who did
this. I’m going to kill him. I’m going to KILL HIM.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t kill
him…” The green-haired woman had an ugly look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
silver-haired man turned to look at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t find any
traces at all. The person who twisted spacetime here is even stronger
than me in the Dao of Spacetime,” the green-haired woman explained.
“There’s no way at all for you to stop him if he chooses not to
fight you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even stronger than
you in the Dao of Spacetime?” The silver-haired man could hardly
believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who on earth did
this?” The green-robed woman frowned. “Could it be the Dao
Alliance? There’s only a few members of the Dao Alliance capable of
doing such a thing, but would they really lower themselves to act
against little Gorho? They wouldn’t, right…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blazingly hot chaos
star. An enormous pitch-black hole suddenly appeared above it,
followed by that gigantic head slowly emerging from within it. It
opened its mouth and began to suck in the entire chaos star. The
chaos star transformed into a blazing beast of fire with an aura of
incredible power. Struggling to break free, it let out a furious
roar: “Who are you?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to come home,
child.” The gigantic beast-head gave a simple reply, then sucked
the blazing creature towards the pitch-black spatial corridor that
had appeared in its mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The blazing
creature wasn’t able to fight back at all. It flew closer and
closer towards the spatial corridor, shrinking in size as it did
before finally being completely sucked in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gigantic head
retreated from the black hole, which quickly closed behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How diverting.” A
human-shaped figure that was completely formed out of water was
seated in the emptiness of space, staring curiously at the world
around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A pitch-black
hole appeared next to it, followed by the emergence of that titanic
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little newborn
child…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The titanic head opened
up its mouth and began to draw in the watery figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh? Eh?” The
watery humanoid figure found itself irresistibly pulled towards that
spatial corridor. It watched with curiosity, not trying to fight back
at all. This was because it didn’t sense even the slightest bit of
enmity or hostility from the seemingly terrifying creature before it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this period of
time, many powerful creatures mysteriously vanished from throughout
the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning and the
other cultivators aboard the flying vessel were drawn into the
spacetime corridor, they could sense space and time twisting around
them. It was quite similar to the feeling of being transported
through a spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a spacetime
transfer. Where are we being transferred to?” Ning and the other
cultivators were all filled with unease. The behemoth which had
sucked them in was simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Spacetime
suddenly stabilized once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?”
Ning could now see that there were at the peak of a towering
mountain. They had been teleported to this incredibly large mountain,
and there were many other living beings here already. More than half
were cultivators, and there had to be over a thousand cultivators
gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
ninety-seven cultivators first put away the flying vessel, then
looked around cautiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists,
where are we? How do we leave this place?” World God Xiang Lu
immediately queried the cultivators who had arrived here before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed
cultivator glanced at World God Xiang Lu, then slowly shook his head.
“There’s no way to leave. This mountain peak is surrounded by
restrictive spells. You won’t be able to take so much as a single
step off of the mountain. As for the mountain itself, we aren’t
able to damage it in the slightest. To tell you the truth, we just
got here a few hours before you did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning and the
others heard this, their faces tightened slightly as pensive looks
appeared in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
yet another hundred-plus cultivators suddenly appeared out of
nowhere. All of the cultivators looked quite lost and uneasy.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared at his
surroundings. Many of the cultivators who had arrived alongside him
tested out the borders of the mountain peak, only to find that it was
indeed surrounded by invisible restrictive spells. As for flying
upwards, they were only able to fly roughly three hundred meters into
the air before being unable to move another inch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
restrictive spell is this?” Ning gave the invisible barrier in
front of him a push. Even when Ning applied his azureflower mist
energy, he was completely unable to budge the barrier in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That mysterious
behemoth felt absolutely terrifying. Not even big brother Solesky or
Daolord Badlands gave me a sensation of such absolute terror.” Ning
was still amazed by this. Both Daolord Solesky and Daolord Badlands
were extremely powerful Daolords of the Endless Territories. “Perhaps
it was because the two of them were very kind towards me, which was
why I didn’t sense much danger from them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master!”
Su Youji appeared by Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Ning looked
at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji said urgently,
“Master, I heard some of the cultivators say that they are from the
Springman Territory and appeared here after being swallowed by that
behemoth. Other cultivators said that they were from the Vastheaven
Territory before being swallowed…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Springman
Territory? Never heard of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Vastheaven
Territory? That was where he was headed towards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all been
swallowed by that behemoth? For a single behemoth of such terrifying
power to exist in the Endless Territories was already quite
impressive. Ning refuse to believe that multiple such beasts existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the behemoth
swallowed us, it formed a spatial corridor within its mouth.” Ning
reflected on this. “It would appear as though this mysterious
behemoth is extremely, extremely skilled in the Dao of Spacetime.
This might be the reason why it was able to appear within so many
places in the Endless Territories in such a brief period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps it isn’t
actually that much more powerful than my big brother Solesky. It is
probably just incredibly talented in spacetime.” This was what Ning
told himself to console himself, but he also understood just how
terrifying this creature had to be in order for it to appear in so
many places at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Daolord Solesky had to physically, laboriously travel all the
way from the Vastheaven Territory to the Badlands Territory, making
usage of many spacetime transfer arrays on the way! The ability to
effortlessly appear throughout the Endless Territories was an utterly
inconceivable ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning consoled himself,
telling himself that it was possible that the mysterious behemoth
wasn’t really that powerful. If this was the case, his chances of
escaping would be a bit better. And yet, deep in his heart he knew
the truth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That the more likely
possibility was that this mysterious behemoth was extremely,
extremely powerful! Far more powerful than Daolord Solesky! It must
be understood that Daolord Allgod was an example of someone who
vastly outstripped Daolord Solesky. In fact, he had even been capable
of chasing down and assaulting Eternal Emperors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
How should I leave this place?” Ning began to grow restless and
nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he supposed to just
give up on his true body? Should he allow his clone in the Badlands
Territory to once more work on rebuilding his main true body? It
would be easy for him to rebuild his true body, but all of the
treasures it was carrying… the six Eternal swords, the three
Mirrorsnow Paintings, the Elementum Waterflame Gourd… there was no
way to get them back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where there is a
will, there is a way.” Ning decided to just wait patiently. “Since
the behemoth went to the trouble of pulling us to this place, it
won’t just kill us for no reason.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, day by
day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day, two days,
three days… more and more cultivators appeared on the mountain
peak, as did many other types of living creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelve days passed in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than thirty
thousand cultivators were now present at the mountain peak, as well
as many other living creatures that were usually quite rare. There
were plant-based lifeforms, flame-based lifeforms, stone-based
lifeforms, and more. All of them were incredibly powerful, and there
were thousands of them gathered here. These were some of the rarest
types of lifeforms in the Endless Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, it seems as
though no one else is coming.” Su Youji whispered softly to Ning
from her position by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Half a day has
gone by without any additional newcomers. I imagine we shall soon
discover why we have been brought to this place.” Ning continued to
wait and watch patiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More time passed,
enough to brew a kettle of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of light
suddenly appeared in the skies, moving towards the mountain peak with
terrifying speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
speed.” The many cultivators and other creatures on the mountain
peak were all stunned. Those two streaks of light were simply too
fast. Ning had previously witnessed other fast creatures such as the
golden Oddbat, but there was simply no comparison!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two streaks of
light landed onto the mountain peak, causing the entire mountain to
tremble. Only now could everyone see them clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a pair of
powerful experts garbed in silver armor, one male and one female. The
silver-armored man’s armor was covered with the imprint of a
thunderbolt, whereas the silver-armored woman’s armor was covered
with the imprint of a sword. Both emanated auras of tremendous power
and majesty, causing the thirty thousand cultivators and other
lifeforms to feel as though they could hardly breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
could sense incredible danger radiating from the two. Although the
two didn’t radiate as much danger as that mysterious behemoth, he
was still certain that they could easily wipe out everyone present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind each of the
silver-armored duo was a pair of black-armored retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four black-armored
retainers also had auras of tremendous power… and their aura was
that of Samsara Daolords! Still, the auras weren’t that powerful;
Ning felt as though they didn’t seem significantly stronger than
the aura the golden Oddbat had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have been
selected by the almighty Hegemon from throughout the Endless
Territories and delivered to this place. Quite a few of you possess
tremendous potential.” The silver-armored man’s voice was deep,
and it shook the entire mountain when he spoke. “Do not panic. For
you to have been brought here, to the most powerful kingdom of the
entire Endless Territories, is something of a tribulation, but it is
an even greater blessing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning and the
others heard this, they all felt stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Selected by the
almighty Hegemon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was that mysterious
behemoth this so-called almighty Hegemon? Ning suspected that this
silver-armored man was an incredibly strong Daolord. For him to refer
to someone else as an ‘almighty Hegemon’ was rather incredible.
Still, when Ning thought about how that mysterious behemoth had been
able to bring so many living beings from throughout the Endless
Territories to this place, Ning felt that it made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most powerful
kingdom of the Endless Territories?” Ning muttered softly, “Can
it be even stronger than the Aeonian Kingdom of the Aeonians?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tremendous
potential? Was our flying vessel captured because of me?” Ning
mused to himself. He wasn’t being narcissistic; he was indeed an
incredibly talented figure amongst his World-level peers. Even the
amount of power he had revealed thus far was already quite shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although you have
been brought to this place, you are not yet citizens of the
Brightshore Kingdom, the most powerful kingdom there is.” The
silver-armored man said, “If you cannot become one of our citizens,
you shall perish! If you wish to survive, you must become one of our
citizens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am willing,” a
cultivator immediately cried out. ‘I’m willing to become a
citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the cultivators
who had been abducted to this place were incredibly talented monsters
like Ji Ning and Gorho, but even more were ordinary cultivators. For
example, most of the cultivators who had been on Ning’s vessel had
wanted to take on Daolord Nihilate as master. They could tell that
this mysterious Brightshore Kingdom was incredibly powerful. Most
likely, joining it would be every bit as beneficial as becoming
apprenticed on Daolord Nihilate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just anyone is
qualified to become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom.” The
silver-armored man glanced sideways at the cultivators as he spoke in
a calm voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are five ways
in which you can become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom. The
first method and best method is to break through to become a Samsara
Daolord. If you do so, you can become one of our citizens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were rendered speechless upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Become a Samsara
Daolord?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the thirty
thousand-plus cultivators who had been abducted to this place, not a
single one was a Samsara Daolord. Breaking through to this level
would be incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second method is
to be protected by one of our Samsara Daolords! Each Samsara Daolord
is permitted to protect three of his or her friends, as well as take
on a maximum of ten slaves,” the silver-armored man said. “If you
are the friend or family member of a Samsara Daolord, you can
naturally become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom as well. But of
course, if you are willing to become a slave you are also permitted
to continue living. Slaves are the lowest-tier members of the
Brightshore Kingdom and will be assigned many labors, but at least
they will be permitted to remain alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
frowned. Become slaves? Lowest-tier members of the kingdom? No one
would wish for such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Samsara Daolords
being able to protect three friends, this rule was most likely put
into place because the Brightshore Kingdom understood that Samsara
Daolords had people they cared about. However, Ning and the others
had just arrived; how could they know any Samsara Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third method is
the safest method. Go to the Hydragon Mountain in the Endless
Territories and work there as a miner. If you can mine enough ore,
you’ll be given your freedom and become one of our citizens.
However, I have to warn you in advance that generally speaking,
World-level cultivators will need to spend a thousand chaos cycles
mining ore before they have enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hydragon Mountain?”
Gorho, unnoticed by the other cultivators, frowned slightly. “I
heard Father speak of it before. Hydragon Mountain is a legendary
place which is the birthplace of the extremely valuable hydragon
gems. Supposedly, it has been occupied and monopolized by a
mysterious organization. So that mysterious organization is actually
this Brightshore Kingdom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
swept the cultivators with his gaze, a smile on his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mine for a thousand
chaos cycles?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that none of
you are willing to laboriously mine ore for a thousand chaos cycles.
However… in the future, many of you will cry and beg for the chance
to go mine there.” The silver-armored man said calmly, “The
fourth option is simple. Survive for a thousand years in the third
bugnest. If you are still alive after a thousand years, you can also
become one of our citizens.”

Chapter 26 - The Choice
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survive for a
thousand years?” All of the cultivators and special lifeforms atop
the mountain peak were intrigued. All of them were at the World level
and had been abducted to this place. To people like them, a thousand
years was nothing. Ji Ning, for example, was going to spend more than
six hundred years just traversing the Sea of Darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they merely had to
spend a thousand years to become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom
and be permitted to live in peace, everyone would be willing to do
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, that was
assuming they were able to survive for a thousand years. From the
sound of things, the third bugnest wasn’t a very nice place to be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
had a hint of a cold smile on his face. “It might sound easy, but I
have to warn you that the third bugnest is a place which our
Brightshore Kingdom uses for rearing bugbeasts. In fact, it is our
third most important nest! It has many powerful bugbeasts within it,
some of which are comparable to Samsara Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
continued, “Some of the bugbeasts there are weak, others are
strong. There are even bugbeasts that are my equal in power, and all
of them live within the third bugnest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
laughed. “If you choose this option, the fourth option, you’ll
have to spend a thousand years living within the third bugnest! If
you are lucky enough not to run into any powerful bugbeasts, you
might be able to survive for a thousand years with ease! But if you
are unlucky and end up encountering some of the stronger bugbeasts,
you might die almost instantly. Based on what we’ve seen in the
past, roughly one in ten cultivators will be able to survive option
four.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just one out of ten?
The cultivators and special lifeforms atop the mountain peak all felt
a sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the incredibly
strong experts like Ji Ning and Gorho, as well as some of the
mysterious lifeforms which possessed incredible power, immediately
abandoned the notion of choosing this option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This option required
luck. They were World-level cultivators, and even the most
monstrously talented of them were only capable of battling Daolords
of the First Step! Bugnest three had many terrifying bugbeasts, and
according to the silver-armored man some of the bugbeasts were just
as strong as him! If they ran into those bugbeasts, they would most
assuredly be doomed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truly powerful experts
wouldn’t be willing to accept such a luck-based outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth option.”
A strange smile played around the silver-armored man’s lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me explain the
fifth option.” The silver-armored woman spoke out coldly, her voice
sharp enough that it seemed to stab into the truesouls of every
single cultivator and special lifeform present. “The fifth option
is to go live on the Astral Islands. All you need to do is stay
alive. The opponents you encounter on the Astral Islands will all be
World-level cultivators. You need to battle against them, and in the
end the most talented individuals will be allowed to survive and
leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask what we
will need to do on the Astral Islands?” A white-robed, incredibly
handsome man who wielded a wooden staff in his hands spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
woman glanced sideways at him then said calmly, “Once you go to the
Astral Islands, you’ll be told. Simply put, your opponents shall be
other World-level cultivators who were similarly abducted from
throughout the Endless Territories. Only the most talented
cultivators shall survive the island and be allowed to leave it!
Roughly one in a hundred will survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only one in a
hundred?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone there is at
the World level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the cultivators
and special lifeforms, as well as the secret descendants of the
Aeonians, were shocked upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning and the
other extremely powerful figures were all leaning towards the fifth
option, because in the fifth option their competition would consist
solely of other World-level cultivators. They felt confident that
they were far more powerful than the vast majority of their peers.
They weren’t willing to risk their luck at the third bugnest… but
on the other hand, it was true that the casualty rate for the fifth
option was a bit too high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only one in a hundred
would survive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ning was
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the Dao
Alliance would dare to carry on such a competition. Every single
World-level cultivator generally had masters or schools who supported
them. The only reason the Brightshore Kingdom acted like this was
because it had simply abducted outsiders from throughout the Endless
Territories without caring about if they died or not. Only they would
use such a brutal method to weed out the losers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’m
powerful, that’s just amongst my fellow cultivators. There are
quite a few special lifeforms who were abducted to this place as
well.” Ning’s greatest worry was having to deal with the special
lifeforms. Some were weak, far weaker than cultivators even though
they had some special techniques. Unfortunately, some were
monstrously powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful special
lifeforms usually were blessed with certain innate abilities that
allowed them to be incredibly skilled in certain areas. For example,
there were certain special lifeforms skilled in illusions who could
possibly outmatch even World-level Heartforce Cultivators. It must be
understood that Ning had yet to meet a single World-level Heartforce
Cultivator to date!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one in a
hundred will survive. My opponents will consist of both the
cultivators and the special lifeforms. What should I do? What should
I choose?” Ning began to ponder this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five options. The
first three options are very safe.” The silver-armored man and the
silver-armored woman exchanged a glance. The silver-armored man said
casually, “Become a Samsara Daolord, receive the protection of a
Samsara Daolord, or become an eternal slave to a Samsara Daolord! Of
course, you can also choose to go mining. These are all options with
no risk to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very few would choose
the first three options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming a Samsara
Daolord wasn’t something you could do just because you wanted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Receiving the
protection of a Samsara Daolord wasn’t that likely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Become a slave? No one
was willing to do such a thing. Few to no World-level cultivators
would voluntarily become the slave of another. They all knew that
becoming a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom would represent a
tremendous blessing, but becoming a slave of the lowest caste meant
that they probably would have no future prospects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mine for a thousand
chaos cycles? That was way too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth option is
to survive in the third bugnest for a thousand years. Roughly one in
ten will survive.” The silver-armored man continued, “The fifth
option is go to the Astral Islands and compete against your peers.
One in a hundred will survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
waved his hand, causing four streams of light to instantly appear and
partition off the mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who choose the
second option, enter the first region. Those who choose the third
option, enter the second region. This region is for the fourth
option. This region is for the fifth option.” The silver-armored
man casually pointed to each of the partitions in turn, then swept
his gaze across everyone present atop the mountain. “Choose your
paths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone atop the
mountain peak began to move. Many were hesitating, but the
silver-armored duo didn’t rush anyone. They just stood there and
waited quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, people began to
make their choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cultivator stepped
into the second region. This represented a decision to go spent
roughly a thousand chaos cycles in the mines. Only then would they
have enough ore to become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m too weak. My
chances of surviving either the third bugnest or the Astral Islands
are both too low.” The cultivator shook his head as he stood there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he made his
choice, quite a few other cultivators began to make their choices as
well. Most cultivators chose the third, fourth, or fifth options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what should
we do? What choice should we make?” Su Youji sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m choosing the
fifth option,” Ning replied mentally. “You?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the only
choice Ning could make. There was no way he would choose the first
three options, because he had to make it to Vastheaven Palace within
a single chaos cycle! He’d only be allowed to leave after becoming
a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom. There was no way Ning could
waste time mining, and there was obviously no way he would be willing
to become another’s slave. He also didn’t have the ability to
become a Samsara Daolord right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the bugnest,
that was purely a matter of luck. Ning absolutely wouldn’t leave
his own destiny up to luck. In the end, he was more confident in his
own abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth option?”
Su Youji hesitated momentarily. “Then I will choose the fifth
option as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to push
yourself that hard. This is a life-altering decision. Choose
whichever option suits you the most,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I choose the fifth
option.” Su Youji gritted her teeth. “I know that I’m fairly
weak, but with those bugbeasts you loaned me I should be able to hold
my own. I’m unwilling to choose any of the other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. As he saw
it, most likely many of the cultivators would elect to choose the
fifth option. Most of them would rather battle against other
cultivators of the same level than to waste countless years of their
life, become an eternal slave, or put everything up to luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly produced
a bracelet then handed it to Su Youji. “Youji, this holds those
eighteen Hellwind Golems. They won’t be of much use to me, but if
you use them and your fifty-one bugbeasts you should have at least
some chance of surviving this Astral Islands. I’ve already ordered
the Hellwind Golems to obey you in all things. You’ll easily be
able to bind them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, they will be
of help to you.” Su Youji began to grow nervous. She knew exactly
how dangerous the fifth option would be, given that only one in a
hundred would survive. Even special lifeforms would be taking part!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just take it,’
Ning repeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji stared at the
white-robed youth. At first, she had only elected to become Ji Ning’s
retainer because of how monstrously talented he was. However, after
the two spent more time together she slowly began to understand what
type of a person Ji Ning truly was. Ji Ning looked peaceful and
relaxed, but he wouldn’t readily acknowledge others. Once he did,
however, he truly would treat that person as a lifelong friend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had always
sensed that something was perpetually weighing on Ji Ning’s mind.
She had tried to explore this topic but had never been able to make
any progress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
placed the bracelet in Su Youji’s hands, then strode towards the
fifth option’s region. Su Youji nodded, following by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than thirty
thousand cultivators and thousands of special lifeforms. Each made
their own choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What truly surprised
Ning was that twenty-three cultivators and two special lifeforms
actually chose the second option. It must be understood that this was
everyone’s first visit to this place. No one knew any of the local
Samsara Daolords, which meant choosing the second option represented
choosing to become a slave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anything really can
happen, I suppose,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were benefits to
becoming a slave as well. You would become a citizen of the
Brightshore Kingdom, albeit one of the lowest-tier members, and would
gain at least a modicum of access to the Brightshore Kingdom’s
secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third option,
mining. More than a thousand cultivators and a hundred special
lifeforms chose this option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth option,
surviving the bugnest. More than five thousand cultivators and two
hundred special lifeforms chose this option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth option,
surviving the Astral Islands. All the remaining individuals chose
this option.

Chapter 27 - Six Strata
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who chose the
other options were all escorted off by the four black-armored
retainers. As for those who chose to attempt the Astral Islands, they
were escorted by the silver-armored duo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, it wasn’t
really ‘escorting’. They were simply dragged straight into an
estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
and woman flew off the mountain peak and towards a different part of
the Brightshore Kingdom. They physically flew because it was
impossible to teleport within the Brightshore Kingdom; flying was the
only option! The flight would take quite a few days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleventh day of
their journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I sense a
disturbance.” Ji Ning and thirty thousand-plus cultivators and
special lifeforms were still within the estate-world. Ning could
suddenly sense that his three Mirrorsnow Paintings were resonating
with something far off in the distance. “Is there another
Mirrorsnow Painting within the Brightshore Kingdom? I wonder if this
is the one I need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the
silver-armored duo flew past this region, a strange alien lifeform
with green reptilian skin suddenly emerged from the waters of the
lake below. The creature raised his head to stare towards the skies,
locating the silver-armored duo which was now billions of kilometers
away. When the creature saw the silver armor, his face changed. “Was
that a Mirrorsnow Painting? Those two major powers come from the
Twelve Palaces. It should be carried by one of the World-level
cultivators they abducted and are now escorting. Damn. I’ve already
left the Astral Islands. There’s no way back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning could
sense the Mirrorsnow Painting, there was nothing he could do. In the
end, they all spent more than a month and a half in the estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, all the
cultivators and special lifeforms were teleported out of the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?” Ning
and the others all stared curiously at their surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before them was an
enormous dark abyss that devoured all light, making it impossible for
any of them to see to the bottom of this abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Directly above the
abyss hovered a series of islands, each of which was merely three
hundred meters or so in size. There were hundreds of thousands of
these levitating islands! The dense cluster hung there in midair,
continuously swiveling as they did so. Some were higher in the air
than the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bottom stratum held
more than 99% of the islands. Ning estimated that there had to be
more than three hundred thousand islands there!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stratum held
roughly twenty thousand islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stratum held
three thousand islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stratum held
a hundred islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stratum held
merely twelve islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stratum was
the highest stratum, and it held only a single island!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the Astral
Islands.” The silver-armored man pointed at the levitating islands.
“Every single Astral Island has a World-level cultivator!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every one?” Ning
could hear the others all murmuring. That meant more than three
hundred thousand World-level cultivators were gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The cultivators of
the Astral Islands can only be promoted when they challenge
cultivators on the same stratum or a higher stratum,” the
silver-armored man said. “If you can gain ten consecutive victories
against someone of the same level as you, you’ll be promoted to the
next higher island. Win ten more times in a row, and you’ll be
promoted once again. If you lose so much as a single fight… if you
are lucky you will survive, but you’ll still be demoted by one
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s faces
turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
levitating islands. He finally understood what these levitating
islands truly represented. The only island on the sixth stratum held
a cultivator who had defeated at least ten of the cultivators on the
fifth stratum before advancing to the sixth stratum. After doing so…
others might challenge him, but he would have no one else to
challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask, what
must we do to become citizens of the Brightshore Kingdom?” A
cultivator spoke out right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” The silver-armored man smiled. “Choosing the Astral
Islands was actually the best choice. Those who chose to become
slaves have lost their futures, while those who went into the mines
shall be there for a thousand chaos cycles. I’m amazed anyone would
even consider those two choices. I really wonder what the hell they
were thinking. As for those who chose the bugbeast nests… they
probably doubted themselves and their level of strength, which was
why they chose to test their luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
looked at them. “All of you here, however, possess self-confidence
and determination. You chose the path that has a 1% rate of
survival.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
continued, “You’ll engage in multiple duels here on the Astral
Islands. If you want to become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom,
the answer is actually quite a simple one. So long as you can acquire
a complete legacy, you’ll become a citizen of the Brightshore
Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acquire a complete
legacy?” All of the cultivators and special lifeforms present were
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Each time you
defeat a foe on the Astral Islands, you’ll gain a legacy heirloom
which they possess,” The silver-armored man said. “For example, a
legacy created by a powerful Heartforce Cultivator might have been
spread across 3600 legacy treasures. If you can gain all 3600 pieces
and piece together the complete legacy, you’ll be able to become a
citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A heartforce
legacy?” Everyone present, Ning included, was shaken and excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could a legacy
described as something created by a ‘powerful Heartforce
cultivator’ by this mighty Daolord possibly be a simple one? It
must be understood that there were a number of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals who were skilled in heartforce, but there were
very few World-level cultivators of heartforce. As for Samsara
Daolords who possessed heartforce? They were even more rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally. But of
course, any such heartforce legacy would be spread across 3600
different treasures. This would be considered one of the most truly
top-tier legacies. There are many other legacies that are merely
spread out across a thousand legacy treasures. There are also some
that are spread across five hundred or two hundred treasures. Once
you reach the Astral Islands, you’ll easily be able to detect which
legacy treasure is located on which island, and you can go challenge
the person who has what you want. But of course, that’s only if you
are qualified to request the duel. The sole cultivator on the sixth
stratum, for example, isn’t qualified to challenge anyone. He has
to wait for others to challenge him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In short! If you can
piece together a complete legacy, you can request permission to leave
and become a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom. If you piece
together two complete legacies, you absolutely must depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
suddenly laughed. “But of course, you can always do what that
person on the sixth stratum has done. He acquired a complete legacy,
lost a few pieces of it on purpose, then won a second complete
legacy, then lost a few more pieces of it… and as a result, he
slowly built up a library of eight different legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can do that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were instantly rendered speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you pieced together
one legacy, you could leave. If you pieced together two, you had to
leave. There was actually a loophole?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Astral Islands
hold a total of ninety-nine mighty legacies, all of which are
incredibly powerful.” The silver-armored man laughed. “It is
incredibly hard for ordinary citizens of the Brightshore Kingdom to
gain access to such powerful legacies. However, ninety-nine priceless
legacies are present here at the Astral Islands. Unfortunately, they
are spread across many different treasures. If you are strong enough,
go forth and defeat the other cultivators and seize their treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored man
continued, “Remember this! Every day, you are only permitted to
engage in a single duel. If you go a full month without a single
legacy treasure to your name, you will be put to death. Thus, there’s
no way you can avoid battle and just relax.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
immediately understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The losers would have
their legacy treasures be seized! If they didn’t have so much as a
single legacy treasure, the other cultivators wouldn’t even bother
with them, resulting in them living unmolested lives. However… the
Brightshore Kingdom did not wish for this to happen. If you didn’t
have so much as a single legacy treasure for more than a month, you
would perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
would put you to death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other World-level
cultivators would also try to kill you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer you got to
acquiring a full legacy treasure set, the more difficult things would
become. For example, if you had 199 legacy treasures and needed just
one more, other cultivators might take an interest in you and try to
kill you and take everything you had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who wish to
try for the truly top-tier legacies will have an even higher chance
of death. Those who go for somewhat weaker legacies will have lower
casualties.” Ning understood this principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a place of
both great danger as well as great opportunity. Ninety-nine legacies!
Haha, in the Endless Territories you’d risk your life countless
times over without getting a chance at such a legacy. Here, every
single one of you has a chance! In fact, you can do the same thing
which this guy is doing?” The silver-robed man pointed at the the
cultivator on the sixth level. “This one has already pieced
together eight legacies. If you are strong enough, you can do the
same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course,
you’ll need to be careful as well. Don’t end up dying.” The
silver-armored man suddenly raised his voice. “Old fellow, create
another 31091 astral islands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” A deep voice
rang out from within the dark abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! A
series of stars began to suddenly arise from within that pitch-black
abyss.

Chapter 28 - Arrival
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
flew past the various astral islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
silver-armored man waved his hand, sending out an awe-inspiring blast
of power that pushed at every single World-level cultivator. Even
someone like Ning felt that this surge of power was nigh
irresistible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed that
surge of power, allowing it to carry him forward as he flew towards
the closest astral island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su
Youji’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was far off in
the distance. She had flown towards an astral island as well, but she
was staring at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,” Ning
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You too.” Su Youji
had a look of longing in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh mentally. There was nothing he could do. Once they had
chosen to challenge the trial of the Astral Islands, every single
cultivator would have to fend for themselves. There was simply no way
for him to continue to protect Su Youji. He’d done everything he
could. The rest was up to her now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various cultivators
and special lifeforms all flew to their own islands, which then
quickly descended to the lowest tier of islands. As for the
silver-armored man and woman, the two simply watched from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the Hegemon
didn’t grab that many people from the Endless Territories this
time, he still managed to grab a few who have incredible talent and
potential.” The silver-armored woman smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
silver-armored man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was one of the most mysterious and powerful organizations in the
Endless Territories. It naturally had its own territory where its
countless denizens dwelled, and it had its own World-level
cultivators which it reared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, every so often
the almighty Hegemon would abduct promising figures from throughout
the Endless Territories. Generally speaking, he wouldn’t grab too
many people, less than a hundred thousand. Compared to the vastness
of the Endless Territories, this was a fairly small sum and so the
other major powers were willing to tolerate his actions. Nobody
wished to make an enemy of the Hegemon over something as minor as
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many do you
think will be able to make it onto the fifth or sixth levels?” The
silver-armored woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth level? I’m
guessing ten! As for the sixth… that’s hard to say. It’s
possible that none of them will make it.” The silver-armored man’s
gaze turned towards the very apex of the hundreds of thousands of
astral islands, at that single solitary island that sat atop the
sixth level. “Bertulu… I wonder which of our Twelve Palaces he
will end up choosing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely it’ll
be the Palace of the Heart or the Palace of Radiance.” The
silver-armored woman sighed. “It has been a long, long time since
our Brightshore Kingdom has encountered a peerless genius like him.
He was originally just a rather intriguing special lifeform. Who
would’ve thought that he would actually become the equal of the
Ancient cultivators?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The first
time I saw Bertulu, I took him for an Ancient cultivator as well.”
The silver-armored man let out a sigh. “What a dazzling figure!
Even the Hegemon is paying attention to him. The Heart Palace and the
Radiant Palace are fighting fiercely over him in secret. Both sides
hope that Bertulu will join them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, he’s
not skilled in the sword. If he was, I’d be hoping for him to join
our Sword Palace.” The silver-armored woman shook her head. “Let’s
go. Our mission is over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two glanced a final
time at the sole island on the sixth level, then transformed into
twin streaks of light that quickly departed. Both of them knew that
Bertulu was capable of breaking through to the Samsara Daolord level
whenever he wished. Once he made his breakthrough… even though he
would merely be a Daolord of the First Step, he would probably be
just as strong as most Daolords of the Third Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If so, he would be
every bit a match for the two of them. Even the Hegemon was paying
attention to this peerless genius. The two of them viewed him as they
would equals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was walking
through his quiet astral island. This island was merely three hundred
meters in size, but it had a graceful little residence that was
actually decorated with many unique statues . As soon as Ning had
landed within this astral island, it had recognized him as its
master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
I’ll be staying here for quite a long period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning willed the residence to change in appearance, making it look
like the houses he stayed in back when he had lived on Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pushed open the door
to the home. Inside the home, there was actually a reclining sofa.
Ning lay down on the sofa, then casually waved his hand, causing a
golden book to appear and fly into Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golden book held
records regarding the other three hundred thousand-plus islands.
Every single cultivator on those islands held a piece of a legacy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This book also
contained an explanation regarding the ninety-nine precious legacies
that were here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number one
legacy is the heartforce legacy, a legacy which was created by a
Heartforce Cultivator who had reached the Verge of the Daomerge,
Daolord Featherdress. This heartforce legacy is mysterious but very
powerful. Every single Heartforce Cultivator stands at the very apex
of power amongst cultivators of the same level. Daolord Featherdress
was once the most powerful Daolord in all the Endless Territories!
Alas, he failed his Daomerge. Before dying, he slew an Eternal
Emperor… and this legacy is just as valuable as the legacy of an
Eternal Emperor’s! It has been separated into 3600 parts. If you
gather the 3600 legacy treasures and merge them together, you shall
gain access to this legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number two
legacy is the spacetime legacy, a legacy left behind by the almighty
Hegemon himself. Although this is merely the first chapter of the
full technique, it will be enough to allow you to roam the Endless
Territories without fear. It has been scattered across 1800 different
legacy treasures. If you gather all 1800 legacy treasures, you can
gain this legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number three
legacy…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a detailed
ranking of all ninety-nine legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
legacies required a total of 3600 legacy treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weakest legacies
merely required a hundred legacy treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
intrigued by quite a few of them, he still shook his head privately.
“As expected, this is merely a place for weeding out weak
World-level cultivators. The most powerful legacies of the
Brightshore Kingdom are not here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number two legacy
had been left behind by the almighty Hegemon. If this was the
complete legacy, it would be an absolutely incredible boon… but
alas, it was merely the first chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninety-nine legacies in
total. The Hegemon had only left behind the number two legacy. The
other ninety-eight came from various Daolords. The legacies of a
Daolord and the legacies of an Eternal Emperor were completely
different things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of Daolord
Featherdress or Daolord Allgod were incredibly powerful, capable of
matching or even exceeding Eternal Emperors. However, every single
Eternal Emperor was at least on their general level, and some were
even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, the four
paintings and legacies of Emperor Mirrorsnow were more valuable than
these ninety-nine legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That number one legacy,
the heartforce legacy, is quite valuable though. I imagine that one
is on par with Emperor Mirrorsnow’s legacy.” Ning carefully read
through the entire book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wanted sword-arts,
and there were two types available. One was ranked nineteen, the
other ranked seventy-three! Both had been left behind by Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I have the
chance, I really do need to try and acquire the fourth Mirrorsnow
Painting. As for these sword-arts here? I should try to use them to
validate and test my own sword-arts. It should be of some benefit, at
least.” Ning had long ago found his own path and understanding
regarding the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it, the
more sword-arts the better. He had studied more than five thousand
sword-arts in the Hall of Swords in the Allgod Estate, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s eyes
suddenly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one seems to
be… not bad at all!” On his second careful reading, Ning’s gaze
fell upon the ninth-ranked legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth-ranked legacy
was the footwork legacy. This was a footwork technique meant for
close combat which had been left behind by an unknown major power who
had gained certain special insights over lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Ning hadn’t
paid it much attention as he had focused on searching for heartforce
techniques and sword-arts. However, on his second careful
read-through he realized how extraordinary this ninth-ranked legacy
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a footwork
technique to be ranked number nine was extraordinary, in and of
itself. This was also a technique that was devised based on
lightning. Ning trained in the [Novessence Thunder] and was fairly
familiar with lightning; most likely, he would be a good fit for this
footwork legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In battle, I
currently rely on my sword-arts and just use my the Thunderlight
Wings for support. I don’t have any actual, decent footwork
techniques.” After carefully reading through the book, Ning made up
his mind. His first target would be the ninth-ranked footwork
technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A newbie?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many newbies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and the other
World-level cultivators flew towards the astral islands, the many
newly created islands began to descend towards the bottom stratum of
islands. This naturally attracted the attention of the hundreds of
thousands of World-level cultivators who were already present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These cultivators stood
atop their own astral islands, watching from afar. Some began to scan
their golden books to gain some basic insights into these newcomers.
Each golden book recorded rudimentary information regarding the
cultivators on each island and the legacy treasures they possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wager these
newbies are carrying plenty of chaos nectar and treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what we
can take from them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenge issued.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenge issued.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the more
powerful cultivators were intrigued. The weak ones in their group had
been plundered long ago, with some having lost all their magic
treasures! These newly arrived cultivators, however, would definitely
have quite a few treasures on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life in the Brightshore
Kingdom was the same as life anywhere else. If you wanted to live,
you’d need treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to issue a
challenge right away.” There were some cultivators who were
extremely powerful but who had lost their treasures to even more
powerful cultivators. These people immediately began to issue
challenges, as they were in desperate need of treasures! They
naturally chose to go after the newcomers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A challenge? A
challenge from the third stratum?” Ning was relaxing on his sofa,
flipping through the information pertaining to the ninety-nine
legacies when he suddenly received a challenge notification.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 - The First Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems a lot of
people are interested in newcomers like myself.” Ji Ning was in no
rush. Instead of answering, he continued to wait patiently as more
and more challenges began to accumulate. One… two… three.. four…
five…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Apparently, quite a few
people were interested in challenging Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the time needed to
boil a kettle of tea, Ning received one challenge from the third
stratum, two challenges from the second stratum, and twelve
challenges from the bottom stratum!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of fifteen
World-level cultivators have challenged me,” Ning mused. Per the
rules of this place, each World-level cultivator could only issue one
challenge each day! Ning was permitted to challenge a different
World-level cultivator as well, but if they didn’t accept… Ning
would have to choose from one of the fifteen challengers. He would
have to accept at least one challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, to be
challenged by so many people at once was actually quite rare. The
only reason why there were so many challenges was because everyone
knew that Ji Ning and the others had to be carrying many treasures on
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, it was
entirely possible that days would pass between challenges!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who should I choose?
The Astral Islands are divided up into six strata. The third stratum
is neither high nor low… and there are more than three thousand
cultivators on that level. I’ll go with this guy.” Ning’s
talent made him bold. Weaker new arrivals would most likely choose
someone on the first floor as their first opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through the golden
book, Ning willed for his opponent’s message of challenge to be
shattered. This represented him accepting the challenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than
three thousand islands hovering within the third stratum. Within one
of those astral islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He accepted? He
actually accepted my challenge?” The chubby youth instantly jumped
to his feet, a look of wild joy on his face. “Ahahaha, he actually
accepted? This is great. It seems that things are finally turning
around for me, Pillsaint. Has my luck finally arrived?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man known as
Pillsaint was the type of person who simply couldn’t hide or
disguise his emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a venerable
master of the Dao of Alchemy, but my alchemical prowess is completely
useless here. Instead, I have to battle against all these other
World-level cultivators.” The chubby youth muttered to himself as
he walked towards a room. He pushed the door open, then entered. The
walls of this room were covered with many divine runes. Upon entering
the room, you would also be entering this powerful formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space began to twist
and distort, with World God Pillsaint disappearing into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This island was a
beautiful one that was covered with a layer of frost and snow. The
entire island was completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pudgy youth suddenly
appeared out of nowhere. He glanced at his surroundings, noticing
that the entire island was covered with a layer of silvery snow. He
was able to see everything quite clearly, and he was quite satisfied.
“This battleground is a good one. The scenery is nice, at least.
Way better than the last one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems my luck
really is turning.” World God Pillsaint lay down on the snow,
half-closing his eyes as he relaxed. “I don’t have many legacies
left, but those damnable cultivators on the fourth level keep on
coming to rob me of what I have. I hope my luck takes a turn for the
better for once. Hopefully this guy will have at least an Eternal
weapon. If I can get an Eternal weapon, I’ll become much more
powerful and be capable of giving those fellows on the fourth level a
good fight. I might even be able to acquire a complete legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he had been
trying to collect the ninety-sixth legacy, a legacy which was
scattered across a hundred legacy treasures. He had gained a total of
ninety-one pieces, but a damnable cultivator on the fourth level had
issued him a challenge. Pillsaint had hurriedly issued a challenge of
his own to a cultivator on the second stratum. If that cultivator had
accepted, then there would’ve been no need for Pillsaint to battle
the cultivator from the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the cultivator
from the second stratum had declined to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint had no other
options. He had to accept the challenge from the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The results of that
battle were… he lost. His legacy treasures were stripped from him!
He had worked so hard for so long, but it all instantly went up in
smoke. He had damn near gone mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space twisted once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning appeared atop
this icy island. As he glanced at the scenery, Ning couldn’t help
but smile very slightly. He also noticed the pudgy youth who was
sleeping on the snowy ground not too far away from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The chubby
youth rose to his feet and stared at Ning, a scorching look in his
eyes. “Fellow Daoist, you have an extraordinary demeanor. I imagine
you must be carrying valuable treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chubby youth’s
eyes instantly lit up as he grew even more excited. “Eternal
treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning laughed
and nodded. Hundreds of thousands of World-level cultivators were
here, and most likely a good number of them held Eternal weapons.
Ning couldn’t bother to hide the fact that he had one of his own. A
weak person who had an Eternal weapon might become a target, but Ning
was strong enough that he had nothing to fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ehehe. Treasures
belong to the strong, you know. It would be wasted in your hands.”
The pudgy youth’s aura suddenly blasted forth as he manifested a
total of six arms. He now wielded six black hammers in his hands.
“Hurry up and hand it over, and I’ll spare your life if you do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some reason, Ning
couldn’t help but have a good feeling about this pudgy youth. He
almost felt as though he was looking at an infant. This pudgy youth
wore his heart on his sleeve, his emotions on display for anyone to
see. He didn’t seem to have any evil intentions at all and appeared
to be a valiant man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning suddenly
felt a twinge of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he possibly
treat any World-level cultivator as he would a child? For Ning to
feel kindly disposed to him without even realizing it… it was
possible that this was because this cultivator truly was a good man,
but it was also possible that he had trained in some sort of
mesmerizing technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s see
what you have.” Ning held a Violetjewel in each of his two hands.
Here on the Astral Islands, even a battle against someone weaker had
to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although two swords
wasn’t the full extent of Ning’s power, it was enough for Ning to
generate a truly airtight defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eat a hammer!” The
pudgy youth charged forwards, the great warhammer in his hands
transforming into a streak of light that caused space to collapse in
on itself. The power of this blow was so great that even Ning
couldn’t help but feel speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A supreme World God? It
seemed he was actually more than just that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning released a
seemingly simple sword-strike that struck directly against the great
warhammer that was slamming down towards him. Warhammers were weapons
well-suited for heavy smashing blows, and to use sword-arts in a
head-on clash against a warhammer was indeed a foolish decision.
However, Ning held tremendous confidence in his own strength. It was
highly unlikely that he would find anyone in the World level who
could overcome him in raw physical power… and if Ning DID encounter
some a powerful freak that was even stronger than him, Ning would run
away as fast as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As expected, this
casual strike from Ning was enough to send his opponent staggering
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
A dazed look appeared on the pudgy youth’s face as he stared at
Ning. “I just wanted to fight a newbie. Why the hell did I run into
such a strong one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way. I don’t
believe this.” The pudgy youth once more charged forwards, his six
warhammers shattering the heavens as they came smashing down towards
Ning once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His opponent was most
likely a supreme World God, and his awe-inspiring hammer-arts were
mighty and difficult to defend against. However, there was a flaw to
this type of an attack, which used overwhelming raw power and space
itself to crush down upon one’s foes. The flaw was… if your foe
could withstand your attacks, you would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning
showed no mercy at all, striking out three times in quick succession.
The first strike knocked the youth backwards, the second caused him
to stumble as he frantically defended. When Pillsaint fell down to
the ground, a huge crater appeared in the ground beneath him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning’s third
sword slammed into the opponent, the pudgy youth vomited out a
mouthful of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give up?” Ning
pointed at his foe with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are way too
strong. Even on the fourth floor, only those freaks who once made it
to the fifth floor would be a match for you.” The pudgy youth lay
there within his crater, somewhat dazed. “Why is my luck so shitty?
More than thirty thousand newbies, and I have to pick a freak who is
strong enough to make it to the fifth stratum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued upon
hearing this. He didn’t know how strong the various experts on the
Astral Islands were, but his opponent had clearly been here for quite
some time and knew many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s only a few
freaks like him, but I just had to run into one.” The pudgy youth
shook his head, then looked at Ning. He said hurriedly, “Can you
please not take away my warhammers? They are just Dao weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao weapons?” Ning
was secretly surprised. The youth had been able to unleash the power
of a supreme World God while using mere Dao weapons? This fellow was
incredibly strong, much more powerful than God Emperor Blacklotus had
been! If he was using an Eternal weapon… didn’t that mean he
would have the power of a transcendent World God?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m telling the
truth. See for yourself!” The pudgy youth said hurriedly, “You
can send out your divine sense and scan any of the treasures I’m
carrying inside of me. Ugh, I’ve been robbed of all of my chaos
nectar. All I have left are these six hammers…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had
encountered a few people who were slightly stronger than him, they
generally wouldn’t go too far. If they did, World God Pillsaint
would’ve gone all-out. To kill a powerful World God was a very
difficult feat; normally, the only option for doing so was to exhaust
his store of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine power needed a
fairly long period of time in order to recover. However, on the
Astral Islands it was possible that one would receive a challenge
every single day. If you lost your power, you might well fall victim
to the schemes of another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, unless there was
an overwhelming disparity in power, these cultivators generally
wouldn’t force their foes to go all-out. That was of no benefit to
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning was
capable of easily slaying his opponent. The difference in power
between the two truly was quite great. His foe was merely a supreme
World God, whereas Ning was comparable to a Daolord of the First
Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I have are these
six hammers.” The pudgy youth stared at Ning. He really was worried
that Ning would take those hammers away from him.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 - Three Months
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning wished to
take his warhammers by force, he would be dramatically weakened.
Although he could still go abuse other cultivators on the first
stratum and steal a few Dao weapons from them, he had brought those
six warhammers with him from the outside world. They were very
suitable weapons for him, and it would be quite hard for him to find
similarly suitable weapons on those weaker cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you serious…”
Ning swept the man with his godsense. The man didn’t resist at all,
allowing Ning to scan him with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t even
have a single bottle of chaos nectar or a single chaos jewel.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I used to! They took
everything from me.” The pudgy youth shook his head. “Nothing I
could do. They were stronger than me. I’m just happy I was able to
keep my six warhammers. I used to have an Eternal treasure, but that
was taken from me as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he looked
at Ning in a rather anxious, beseeching manner. “Can you leave my
six warhammers alone? Please?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I
have no interest in those six warhammers whatsoever,” Ning
chuckled. “I just want to ask you a few questions. Also, you have
to give me that sword-arts legacy you are holding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.” The
pudgy youth immediately tossed a sword-shaped talisman over towards
Ning. This was one of the legacy treasures that formed the
seventy-third ranked legacy, the sword-arts legacy. Although it was
merely ranked seventy-three, it was still divided up into 108
different legacy treasures. You had to acquire the full set in order
to gain access to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing that Ning didn’t
intend to kill him, the pudgy youth hurriedly said, “Ask me
whatever you wish. I, Pillsaint, will tell you everything you want to
know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your name is
Pillsaint?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Pillsaint. This
is the Daoist title which my master gave me. My master is skilled in
alchemy, as am I. Who would’ve thought that I would be this
unlucky? A Daolord had asked me to go help him refine some pills, but
halfway on the trip back I was abducted to this place by a different
Samsara Daolord, as were the ten World-level cultivators who the
first Daolord had sent to invite me.” Pillsaint had a resigned look
on his face as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked upon
hearing this. Skilled in Alchemy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fellow was capable
of unleashing the power of a supreme World God when using mere Dao
weapons… and he was actually a master of alchemy? A Daolord had
asked him to go refine pills for him? That meant his skill in alchemy
had to be incredibly high. Ning knew that the skilled alchemists and
pill-refiners of the Endless Territories were incredibly respected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh, but so what if
I’m good at alchemy? The Brightshore Kingdom doesn’t give a damn
about me. All I can do is stay here and duel other World-level
cultivators.” World God Pillsaint said resignedly, “I’m skilled
in controlling the empty void of space and am physically strong, but
that’s just because those are necessary components of pillforging.
Right now, all I can do is use my warhammers to battle against other
World-level cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that
this World God Pillsaint had to be extremely skilled in the arts of
alchemy and had an even more skilled alchemy master. In the outside
world, not even ordinary Samsara Daolords would go offend someone of
his status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning could, he would
try to find a chance to help this man out. If World God Pillsaint was
able to leave this place in the future, Ning could ask him or even
his master to help him refine any special pills that he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. In the future,
I’ll need to acquire a few extra legacies. If I find any that I
don’t need, I can just lose a set to him on purpose,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only legacies Ning
himself were interested at present were the sword-arts legacy and the
footwork legacy. As for the top-ranked heartforce legacy, Ning was
interested in that as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the rules were
that those who acquired a complete legacy could leave, but those who
acquired two were required to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, if Ning wanted to
acquire several different legacies, he would have to lose a few
battles on purpose and let his opponents acquire those legacies! Ning
was definitely planning on helping out Su Youji, but if he had the
chance he would also help this World God Pillsaint as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
astral island Youji is now on.” There was nothing Ning could do.
Only after battling someone could he find out exactly which island a
specific cultivator was on. He wanted to help her out, but he
currently could not. Only in the future would he be able to try to
come up with a way of locating her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you this,”
Ning said, “Roughly how strong are the cultivators on each island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s hard to
say, because even the first stratum might hold a few freakishly
strong individuals.” World God Pillsaint glanced at Ning, then said
hurriedly, “I can just give you a rough estimate of how strong
everyone is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The astral islands
on the first stratum generally hold master-class World-level
cultivators as well as a few even weaker cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second stratum
holds more formidable cultivators. Some have unique treasures or
techniques, such as special spells or powerful golems. Others have
reached at least the supreme World-level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third stratum is
generally where most supreme World-level cultivators reside, or those
who possess extremely special techniques. I’m a supreme World God
myself, and I’m very physically strong. I’m capable of forcing my
opponents to face my attacks head-on, which is my position within the
third stratum is quite secure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth stratum
is generally filled with transcendent World-level cultivators, as
well as some of the freakishly strong figures who belonged to the
fifth stratum but who were temporarily beaten down by other
cultivators from that stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stratum…
everyone capable of standing securely within that stratum is an utter
monster. Most of them probably have the power of Daolords of the
First Step, and many have very unique skills and abilities. Who knows
what special skills or trump cards they have up their sleeves? All I
know is that I’ve never run into them before. There are only twelve
individuals total on the fifth stratum. Eight are special lifeforms
while four are cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve on the fifth
stratum all had the power of Daolords of the First Step? How
terrifying. Still, most were special lifeforms. There were certain
powerful races that were born with tremendous advantages over normal
cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s only a
single cultivator on the sixth stratum. I hear that his name is
Bertulu, and that he’s an absolutely freakishly strong figure.”
The pudgy youth shook his head. “What a freak! He’s a special
lifeform as well. Not even those other freaks on the fifth stratum
can beat him. He truly is unfathomably strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bertulu?” Ning
silently memorized this name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, there
is a rule in the Astral Islands that anyone who makes it to the fifth
level will be protected, even if they are temporarily knocked down to
a lower level. That’s why the only reason why Bertulu hasn’t
completely demolished all of the other freaks.” World God Pillsaint
shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood the
purpose of this rule. The Astral Islands existed in order to help the
Brightshore Kingdom select some of the most powerful World-level
cultivators to join its ranks. The three hundred thousand-plus
cultivators within the Astral Islands right now included many
powerful cultivators which the Brightshore Kingdom had abducted from
the outside world, but it also held many cultivators which had
emerged from the Brightshore Kingdom’s own territory. Ordinary
World-level cultivators simply couldn’t compare to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how many powerful
World-level cultivators were amongst the three hundred thousand, for
a few absolute monsters to emerge was normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
anyone who could make it to the fifth stratum was a freak in some
way. Any such person would be protected by the Astral Islands. Even
if other cultivators defeated them, they would at most be permitted
to take away their opponents’ legacy treasures. It was forbidden to
kill them! It was also forbidden to seize any of their other,
personal treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, this was
just a minor form of protection. Although the Brightshore Kingdom was
intrigued by these monsters, it wouldn’t necessarily go crazy over
them. This was because although they were monsters now, they wouldn’t
necessarily be monstrously powerful Daolords in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Allgod Estate,
the formation-spirit of the Ten Thousand Mountains had encountered
quite a few freakishly talented figures over countless eons, but the
only truly formidable figure to emerge was Daolord Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Bertulu
was so incredibly, freakishly talented that even the most powerful
kingdom in all the Endless Territories, the Brightshore Kingdom,
rarely encountered his equal. He had already found his path and was
capable of becoming a Samsara Daolord whenever he wished. The way
they treated him was naturally different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that I
should be strong enough to make it to the fifth stratum,” Ning
mused. “Only by making it to the fifth stratum will I be
protected.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
confident in his abilities, he wasn’t confident in his abilities to
defeat Bertulu of the sixth stratum. Bertulu had to have acquired the
number one legacy, the heartforce legacy, a long time ago.
Cultivators skilled in heartforce were quite terrifying to fight, and
Ning wasn’t confident in his ability to withstand him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to seize
every moment. The more time passes, the more variables might appear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this first
battle, Ning began to accept one challenge after another. He kept a
low-profile as he dueled other cultivators on the first stratum. Some
challenged him, others he challenged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also times
when no one challenged him and the person he challenged refused. In
that case, he had no choice but to wait and rest for a day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ended up spending
twelve days before advancing to the second stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending another
twenty-six days, he advanced to the third stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending another
fifty-one days, he advanced to the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t encounter
any of the freaks who had previously made it to the fifth stratum.
Since everyone who had been on the fifth stratum was under
protection, it was very rare for other World-level cultivators to
challenge them. Thus, those freaks generally spent most of their time
meditating on the powerful legacies they had acquired. It was
entirely possible for them to spend a century in meditation. Ning’s
sudden rise to power did attract the attention of two ‘protected’
World-level cultivators, but those two didn’t move to challenge
him. Instead, they watched quietly.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning took things
slowly and steadily. He began to challenge the other cultivators on
the fourth level. Out of an abundance of caution, Ning didn’t
challenge anyone who had made it to the fifth stratum in the past.
Ning’s plan was to wait until he himself made it to the fifth
stratum before challenging them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here in the Brightshore
Kingdom, a single mistake could result in a cascade of errors. There
were many freakishly strong cultivators in the Endless Territories
who had ended up perishing midway through their journeys. If he was
too arrogant, he would probably join them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single opponent
on the fourth stratum was incredibly strong, at least as strong as a
transcendent World God. They all had their own special skills, and
Ning would spend time after each battle meditating on his
experiences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the
astral islands levitating within the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a strange
building here that looked round from the outside but was box-shaped
on the inside. This was the finest temporal acceleration treasure
which Ning had acquired from Arroyo, a treasure which was far better
than the Heavengazer Tower. It could easily maintain a rate of time
that was fifty times faster than normal, and if you were willing to
use up your Immortal energy it could go up to two hundred times the
normal rate! But of course, this would use up an absolutely
astonishing amount of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
maintaining a rate equivalent to a hundred times the normal rate of
time. He was reflecting on his previous battle and the new insights
it had brought him, using them to perfect his sword-arts. That last
battle had been his sixth battle on the fourth stratum, and he had
won it as he had all his previous battles!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While meditating on his
sword-arts, Ning was in constant resonance with the infinitely
distant prime essence of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prime essence of
the sword was one of the true essences and sources of the endless
primordial chaos. It was where the Dao of the Sword itself originated
from! It constantly emanated mysterious ripples pertaining to the Dao
of the Sword, allowing cultivators to understand more of itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After cultivating
for more than a hundred thousand years, I finally understand.” Ning
suddenly smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering Dao-tree
within his Jindan chaos region had already reached a height of of
more than 105,000 meters tall. In this instant it once more grew
upwards, reaching a height of precisely 108,000 meters tall!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, power
began to flow throughout his entire Jindan chaos region, causing it
to become even more stable than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning’s divine
body suddenly transformed into a large number of godgems. Chaos
energy flowed through him and transformed into more and more godgems,
causing a total of 36,000 godgems to emerge and hover in midair.
Moments later, they reconverged to form a single figure, Ji Ning’s
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve seen through
and comprehended all the foundational insights regarding the Dao of
the Sword. Finally, I have reached the level of full mastery.” Ning
was in a superb mood today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it seemed as
though Ning had only been cultivating for a few thousand years, if
you factored in all the temporal acceleration he had spent more than
a hundred thousand years meditating on the Dao of the Sword! When he
had emerged from the Allgod Estate, his Dao-tree had already been
more than sixty thousand meters tall. He had then engaged in many
battles as well as repeatedly dueled the three experts of the sword
in the Mirrorsnow Paintings, resulting in Ning’s Dao-tree quickly
growing to become more than ninety thousand meters high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent hundreds
of years battling in the Sea of Darkness as well. Although he had
spent less than half a year in this place, the temporal acceleration
meant that dozens of years had gone past for Ning. In addition, Ning
had been battling against all sorts of powerful World-level
cultivators. Thanks to all of these factors, he had finally
understood some of the fundamental principles of the prime essence of
the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant, he
finally understood why it was that this level as known as the level
of ‘full mastery’ and why World Gods at this level were referred
to as ‘master-class’ World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Full mastery of the
World level… so this is nothing more than the outermost level of
understanding the prime essence of the sword.” Ning couldn’t help
but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prime essence of
the sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From it originated the
entire Dao of the Sword within the endless primordial chaos. It was
naturally unfathomable and profound, and many of its most profound
mysteries were actually hidden within the prime essence itself. There
was no way to even sense those mysteries, much less meditate on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the outermost
mysteries of the Dao of the Sword which emanated from it like a halo
could be meditated on. In recent years, Ning had merely been
meditating on those outermost mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single
World-level cultivator of the Dao of the Sword would strive hard to
comprehend these mysteries. And now… Ning had gained a complete
understanding of this outermost layer of the prime essence of the
sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth,
his Dao-tree would be 108,00 meters tall and his godgems would be
36,000 in number!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prime essence of
the sword within the endless primordial chaos would no longer be of
any use to Ning, because there was no way he could meditate on any of
the mysteries that were contained deeper inside of it. Forget about
Ji Ning; not even Samsara Daolords or Eternal Emperors were capable
of entering the prime essence heart of the endless primordial chaos.
This place was the very core of the entire primordial chaos, a place
which cultivators could not possibly enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it wasn’t
just the Dao of the Sword that existed in that place. All Daos
originated from that place!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prime essence of
metal, wood, water, fire, earth, lightning, light, slaughter, the
saber, the sword… all prime essences radiated some of its outermost
mysteries, allowing cultivators to train in them, but held their
deeper mysteries inside of themselves. There was no way those
mysteries could be cultivated in at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, no matter what
path you trained it, you would at most be able to reach the level of
full mastery in a fairly easy manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once you gained full
mastery…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Your insights would
come to an end. You had gained full mastery of what there was to
master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to make
any further advancements, you would have to rely solely on yourself!
In the past, you would be able to continue to attune to the prime
essence of a Dao. Now, however, you would have no one to rely on but
yourself. You would have to find a unique path belonging to yourself,
creating your own Dao out of nowhere and use it to step into the
Samsara Daolord level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because this Dao would
be a completely self-created Dao, this was an incredibly dangerous
prospect. The Dao you created might be a heterodox Dao that was
wrong. That Dao might allow you to step onto the Samsara Daolord
level, but it was entirely possible that soon after embarking on this
path your Dao would suddenly crumble, causing you to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
it was said that with each step, Samsara Daolords tread the line
between life and death! Every single step they took, they would
create an ever-deeper level of the Dao for themselves. If the Dao you
created was an erroneous Dao, then once you attempted to use it to
improve yourself your divine power and truesoul would become to
collapse. You would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each step, they
tread the line between life and death. Some would finally reach the
Verge of the Daomerge, becoming incredibly powerful figures even
amongst their Samsara Daolord fellows. Daolord Solesky was one good
example. If his Daomerge succeeded, it meant that his Dao was a
perfect one which could gain true eternity. Their path would allow
them to live forever within the primordial chaos, with the ravages of
time no longer having any effect upon them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, some of
those Daolords on the Verge had incorrect Daos. That did not,
however, mean that they were weak. There were some Verge-level
Daolords who were capable of battling Eternal Emperors, even though
they themselves would never reach that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I previously was
able to advance at a rapid pace. Now that I have reached the level of
full mastery, I’ll have to find my own path for myself.” Ning
understood exactly how difficult it would be for him to find a path
that would let him enter the Samsara Daolord level.

had now reached an incredible level in the Dao of Thunder. Once he
became a Samsara Daolord, he would reach even more astonishing
heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can train in
thunder in any of the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore.” Wildgloom’s
voice was slightly jarring to the ear. “Senior Flameflow, please
give me some more time to think this matter through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush, no rush.”
The azure-armored elder nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone capable of
residing permanently on the fifth stratum was more than strong enough
to easily acquire a complete legacy. They could’ve left the astral
islands long ago, but most of them were in no rush. There were
legacies here, as well as powerful opponents for them to battle
against. Most importantly, they still had to decide which palace they
were going to join.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces of
Brightshore were all incredibly powerful, but the best palace would
always be the one which suited them the most. They had to decide what
their future path would be before deciding on which palace they would
join.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have my
message-talisman. Once you decide, just break it and I’ll come find
you.” The silver-armored elder smiled as he rose to his feet. “I
won’t disturb you any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Wildgloom
hurriedly rose to his feet to send his guest off. Although this
person had come to invite him, he was still a Samsara Daolord. He was
not, however, one of those black-armored Daolords. Those
black-armored Daolords were the weakest Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
Daolord, Daolord Flameflow, flew out of this astral island. He pulled
out an enormous book and began to casually flip through it. The
members of the Twelve Palaces were permitted to go through the
information which the kingdom possessed regarding all of the
World-level cultivators here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? This fellow has
been here less than half a year, but he’s made it to the fourth
stratum already? He’s also defeated six consecutive foes on the
fourth stratum? He’s undefeated thus far?” As Daolord Flameflow
flipped through the pages of the book, he couldn’t help be startled
by something he read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If someone defeated ten
foes in a row on the fourth stratum, that person would be promoted to
the fifth stratum. This man had defeated six foes in a row without
being defeated a single time. Given this, it was very likely that he
would make it to the fifth stratum in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skilled in both the
sword as well as lightning? His skill in lightning alone allows him
to suppress his foes, and he is quite talented in the Dao of Thunder?
This guy looks like he would be a great fit for my Thunder Palace.
Mm, I should go take a look.” The azure-armored elder quickly
decided to go visit this astral island on the fourth stratum. He
quickly began to stride through the air as he walked towards that
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was, of course,
the astral island which Ning was residing on.

Chapter 32 - The Twelve Palaces of Brightshore
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was meditating
on sword-arts by himself within his astral island, using the
top-grade temporal acceleration Dao treasure, the Luminous Room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position. Before him was a table that had a flagon of wine, a
scroll of parchment, a brush, and a brush holder. Every so often,
he’d pick up the brush and spend a bit of time painting on the
scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art, the Silent World. I still need to spend a
bit more time on it.” Ning was close to mastering the fifth stance
of the [Nameless] sword-art, which was the highest level stance which
World God Northrest himself had been able to master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were both
World-level cultivators and had both reached the level of full
mastery in the Dao of the Sword, but there were still differences in
their sword-arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northrest had only been
a supreme World God due to his Eternal weapon, but some of the truly
peerless geniuses which the Brightshore Kingdom had abducted and
brought to this place were capable of that level of power even when
they used mere Dao weapons. Some were even more terrifyingly strong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what a
difference in sword-arts could make.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of profundity
of sword-arts, there were quite a few people on the Astral Islands
who were superior to Ning! Ning himself understood this quite well.
In short, he simply hadn’t been training for long enough, and he
had broken through to the World level just recently. If these people
knew that he had reached the level of full mastery a mere thousand
years after reaching the World level, they would probably be
completely stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Others won’t care
about how long you have been cultivating. They will only care about
how strong you are. My advantage lies in the strength and speed which
the azureflower mist energy has imbued me with. It gives me the speed
and strength of a Daolord of the First Step! But my weakness is my
sword-arts…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to hurry up
and collect a set of the sword-arts legacy. That will be of use to my
sword-arts as well,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anything referred to as
a ‘legacy’ would include extremely detailed, step-by-step
instructions for cultivators to use. The [Nameless] sword-art which
Ning had acquired was just a fragmentary record; it couldn’t really
be referred to as a true legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other hand, the
many stone sword-steles which World God Northrest had painstakingly
erected in order to help his successor better understand the first
stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the Heartsword stance, would
qualify as a legacy. It contained detailed instructions and provided
true guidance to the learner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the legacy which
World God Northrest had prepared for his successor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the ninety-nine
legacies on the Astral Islands, two of them were sword-arts. However,
these sword-arts had been left behind by Samsara Daolords. It must be
understood that ever since Ning had left the Three Realms, he hadn’t
encountered any formidable Daolord-level experts of the sword who
could provide him with tutelage. He had been working hard all by
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
suddenly disturbed from his meditations. “Someone came?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had bound this
astral island long ago and thus was easily able to sense the presence
of an outsider.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I am restricted
from leaving my astral island. For someone to come to my island means
that this is probably a citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom.” Ning
placed his brush on the brush stand, then immediately left the
Luminous Room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting his
treasure away, Ning emerged from his private room and then walked
into his courtyard where he saw a figure standing outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an old man
dressed in azure armor who had his hands clasped behind his back. As
Ning pushed open the doors to his courtyard, the old man turned
around and smiled at Ning. “I am Flameflow. I am from the Thunder
Palace of the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. This
old man was a Samsara Daolord? He immediately said, “Darknorth
greets you, senior Flameflow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” The
azure-armored man nodded slightly, then let out a praising sigh. “My
dear Darknorth, you are an impressive figure. Just three months after
coming to the Astral Islands, you have already ascended to the fourth
stratum, then won six consecutive battles here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not quite
where I need to be yet. I need ten consecutive victories before I can
make it to the fifth stratum,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
the newcomers to the Astral Islands will have to undergo many battles
and acquire a few legacies, allowing them to improve and grow before
they are able to ascend to the fifth stratum.” The azure-armored
old man said, “As soon as you came here, you won six battles in a
row here on the fourth stratum. I trust that it won’t be too hard
for you to ascend to the fifth stratum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this as
well. There was one particularly valuable part of being here on the
Astral Islands: there were many dazzlingly talented cultivators here.
In the rest of the Endless Territories, it would be quite hard for
Ning to encounter suitable foes. For a transcendent World God to
encounter another transcendent World God was an incredibly rare
experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But here on the Astral
Islands, a large number of formidable World-level cultivators had
been brought together. It was entirely possible and quite easy for a
person to seek out opponents who were roughly on par with him in
strength, or perhaps someone slightly stronger or weaker. Since
losing a duel might very well result in death, everyone was motivated
to fight to their fullest potential. As a result, all the surviving
cultivators were generally able to grow stronger and stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by making it to
the fifth stratum would you receive protection… but how many would
ever be able to ascend to that stratum?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please sit, senior.”
Ning gestured towards the wooden table and seats nearby. Ning had
placed them here, as he often enjoyed sitting down and enjoying some
wine as he stared at the many astral islands hovering outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow sat
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please.” Ning sat
down on the other side and helped pour some wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know you are
skilled in lightning,” Daolord Flameflow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know, senior?”
Ning was surprised. Although he had fought quite a few times in the
Astral Islands, it was only during his two most recent battles that
he had used thunder and lightning. His previous opponents had been so
weak that he hadn’t felt the need.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have full records
of all the battles you engaged in here in the Astral Islands.”
Daolord Flameflow chuckled. “Only by watching your battles and
learning where your specialties lie shall the Twelve Palaces be in a
good position to judge and choose from amongst you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Twelve Palaces?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow
smiled. “You were abducted to this place by the almighty Hegemon,
but you probably don’t know much right now. For weaker cultivators,
being brought here was a calamity, but for someone like you it is a
blessing. The almighty Hegemon… he is an incomparably powerful
figure that is one of the few that truly stands at the very apex of
the Endless Territories. He has been alive for an extremely long
period of time and was the founder of our Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow
asked, “Have you heard of the Dao Alliance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Alliance
spans an incredibly vast area and virtually all cultivators belong to
the Dao Alliance. Compared to the Dao Alliance, our Brightshore
Kingdom is more aloof and more secretive.” Daolord Flameflow said,
“The Brightshore Kingdom almost never gets involved in any wars,
and so we are on fairly good terms with the Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On good terms with the
Dao Alliance? Ning let out a sigh of relief. Vastheaven Palace was
part of the Dao Alliance; if the Brightshore Kingdom was on bad terms
with the Dao Alliance, Ning would’ve been in trouble. But if they
were on good terms… why would this almighty Hegemon abduct so many
of the World-level cultivators belonging to the Dao Alliance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom is primarily divided up into twelve palaces,” Daolord
Flameflow said. “There is also an imperial clan of individuals who
are of the same race as the almighty Hegemon. Although they are few
in number, they are extremely powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are of the same
race as the almighty Hegemon?” Ning suddenly thought back to that
enormous, terrifying behemoth that had abducted him to this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the same race as
that behemoth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The members of
the imperial clan are extremely few in number, but every single one
of them possesses incredible strength and power. But of course, the
almighty Hegemon is the mightiest of them all,” Daolord Flameflow
said. “The imperial clan rarely shows itself, while the Twelve
Palaces of Brightshore comprises virtually all of the cultivators,
Aeonians, special lifeforms, and other powerful experts of the
Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow
continued, “The Twelve Palaces are very powerful. They are divided
into the Palace of the Saber, the Palace of the Sword, the Palace of
Radiance, the Palace of Mortality, the Palace of Thunder, the Palace
of Flames, the Palace of the Heart, the Palace of Kindwater, the
Palace of Woodform, the Palace of Skymetal, the Palace of Deepearth,
and the Palace of Spacetime. My palace, the Thunder Palace, holds
almost all of the Brightshore Kingdom’s experts in the Dao of
Lightning. We have the accumulated legacies of countless generations
of lightning-attribute experts and many Daolords! If you were to join
us, you will definitely be able to make great strides on this path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning truly
understand. At the top of the Brightshore Kingdom stood the Twelve
Palaces. As for the almighty Hegemon and the imperial clan… the
almighty Hegemon was of course quite powerful, but his imperial
clansmen were simply too few in number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Twelve
Palaces, a steady flow of new people would constantly join them. Just
look at the cultivators and special lifeforms currently within the
Astral Islands. The most skillful members would all be brought into
the Twelve Palaces in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you acquire a
full legacy, you’ll be qualified to leave this place. If you wish
to join the Thunder Palace, you can just shatter this
message-talisman of mine.” As Daolord Flameflow spoke, he produced
a deep azure talisman that was brimming with flickers of electricity.
He handed the talisman straight to Ning. “Once you shatter this,
I’ll sense it and immediately come receive you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. The
Thunder Palace? It was destined that he would walk the path of the
Dao of the Sword! His mastery over lightning was far weaker than his
mastery of the sword. The entire reason why he had some skill in this
area was all thanks to one of the nine secret-arts of Daolord Allgod,
the [Novessence Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow
continued, “I know that you are also skilled in sword-arts, and I
imagine that in the future you shall have to choose between the Sword
Palace and the Thunder Palace. None of the Twelve Palaces will give
you any pressure; you can choose whichever palace you so desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.” Ning’s
eyes suddenly lit up. “Senior, you said just now that you know the
results of every battle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. That way, the
Twelve Palaces can more easily choose our new members,” Daolord
Flameflow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then have you
received word of a female Chaos Immortal who is skilled in the
element of fire? She has fifty-one bugbeasts that are comparable to
master-class World Gods as well as a full set of eighteen powerful
golems that are also comparable to master-class World Gods.” Ning
continued hurriedly, “This is what she looks like. She came here by
my side.” As Ning spoke, he waved his finger in the air and caused
an image of Su Youji to appear out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know what
she looks like, but as for a female Chaos Immortal skilled in fire
who has bugbeasts and eighteen golems…” Daolord Flameflow
laughed. “There is indeed someone amongst the new arrivals who fits
these criteria.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. He found her. Finally, he had found Su Youji!

Chapter 33 - The Tenth Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Female Chaos
Immortals are rare to begin with, and ones who specialize in using
golems and bugbeasts are even rarer. When you factor in her being
skilled the Dao of Fire… yes, there’s only one who fits it all.”
Daolord Flameflow looked at Ji Ning. “Is she your Dao-companion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She is my friend,”
Ji Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that being
your friend is a good thing.” Daolord Flameflow said, “Are you
planning to acquire a full legacy, then lose it to her on purpose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
Once she acquired a full legacy, she would be able to leave this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow said,
“Then there is something I must tell you in advance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes?” Ning looked
at the Daolord. Something he needed to know in advance? Was there
something wrong with this plan of his? But based on what he had seen
thus far, losing on purpose was entirely permitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being in the Astral
Islands is both a curse and a blessing. If your friend is
extraordinarily talented, it might be a better idea for you to let
her stay here for a while longer. But of course, if she’s weak it
would be best for her to leave early on,” Daolord Flameflow said.
“My reminder to you is this… even if she manages to survive the
Astral Islands, it’ll still be quite hard for her to join the
Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very hard?” Ning
was intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord
Flameflow nodded. “The Twelve Palaces represent the twelve most
powerful organizations in the entire Brightshore Kingdom. They
recruit Daolords as well as truly talented World-level cultivators
who are worthy of further training. It is quite difficult for the
many denizens of the Brightshore Kingdom to actually join the Twelve
Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Flameflow
continued, “There are some, for example, who willingly became
slaves of the kingdom. Although they are still considered our
citizens, they stand at the lowest rungs of society. As for those who
went to mine for a thousand chaos cycles, they will become citizens
upon their return, yes, but do you really think they are qualified to
join the Twelve Palaces?” Daolord Flameflow laughed. “Becoming a
citizen of the Brightshore Kingdom and joining the Twelve Palaces are
two separate matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take yourself, for
example. You have the power to make it into the fifth stratum, which
is why I came to give you an invitation.” Daolord Flameflow
continued, “Some weaker World-level cultivators might never receive
an invitation, even if they do manage to put together a complete
legacy. There is a high barrier to entry for the Twelve Palaces, and
even the citizens of the Brightshore Kingdom have to undergo many
different trials before they are granted entry. But of course, people
like you who have received invitations don’t need to go through any
further trials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood. However,
he still wanted to help Su Youji as quickly as possible. Ning knew
exactly what her strengths and limitations were. She had just reached
the World level a short while ago, and her insights into the Dao
weren’t even as profound as Ning’s, nor was she a battle-hardy
World God. She would be able to buy herself some time with her
bugbeasts and golems, but as time passed… eventually, she would
encounter a truly talented expert and might well lose her life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like to ask
you, senior, to tell me which astral island she is on,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden book
included detailed records of every astral island, including basic
information about each cultivator and the treasures they held. There
was naturally a notation of each location as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
cultivators in the Astral Islands would only learn of each other’s
locations through actual combat. But it was only natural for a
Samsara Daolord of the Thunder Palace of the Twelve Palaces to know
much more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The astral island
she is on has the address of 399-236,” Daolord Flameflow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this one over
there.” Ning immediately was able to locate the island in question.
This astral island was still on the first stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend
Darknorth, I won’t disturb you any further. If you wish to join the
Palace of Thunder, simply shatter the talisman and I’ll come
welcome you.” Daolord Flameflow rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for
everything, senior.” Ning felt quite grateful towards the man. If
it wasn’t for his help, even he didn’t know how long it would be
before he found Su Youji’s astral island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter,”
Daolord Flameflow said with a laugh. He then turned and left,
disappearing into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched silently
and pensively as the Daolord left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to make it to
the fifth stratum as soon as possible. I’ll then acquire one of the
simpler sword-arts legacies and lose it to Youji right away,” Ning
mused to himself. Two sword-arts legacies and one footwork legacy.
Ning wanted the footwork legacy the most. Alas, it was highly ranked
and hard to acquire. In fact, most of the legacy treasures were with
the cultivators on the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the coming days,
Ning began to issue challenges anew to the other cultivators on his
stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stratum. The
seventh battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning encountered an
expert who was skilled in the Dao of Spacetime. This was Ning’s
toughest, most grueling battle, because his opponent’s fleeing
skills were simply incredible, allowing him to retreat and advance as
he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that he had
an advantage in actual power, but he was still unable to do anything
to his opponent. Even when he used the [Novessence Thunder] to
restrain his foe’s movements, his foe’s movements remained
unpredictably fast and fluid. In the end, Ning was forced to split
his body into two, using two bodies to battle at the same time.
Although each body was weaker than his true body, they were still
individually superior than his opponent in strength. Ning wasn’t
exactly slow. With two bodies surrounding and attacking at the same
time, as well as the assistance of the [Novessence Thunder], Ning was
able to force his opponent into admitting defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stratum. The
eighth battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle was against
a special lifeform. Special lifeforms were different from ordinary
cultivators. Ordinary cultivators were all born from the Worldheart
of their chaosworld. Natural-born Elder Gods like Nuwa were said to
be born from the primordial chaos, but in reality it was the
chaosworld generated by the Worldheart which gave birth to them. They
were born with mastery over one of the Heavenly Daos of their
chaosworld, but they still emerged from the mysterious, marvelous
powers of their Worldheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods, Empyrean
Gods, mortals… all of them were produced from the Worldheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Special lifeforms,
however, were truly born within unique situations within the endless
primordial chaos. There was a qualitative difference between them and
cultivators, and although some of them were weak, others of them were
inconceivably strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This opponent fighting
Ning was an ape-like creature. Just prior to the battle, the creature
was crunching his way through a tasty meal of strange, metallic
objects. It had a body as tough as a Dao weapon and incredible
strength, but it was also extremely intelligent. It had even deeper
insights into the Dao than Ning did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the end it
still lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Ning
was just as strong as it was, but was also much faster! Most
importantly of all, Ning was wielding six Eternal weapons while the
ape had to rely on its two arms… but to actually kill the ape would
be incredibly difficult, because Ning was unable to damage its body.
Binding it would also be quite difficult. The only thing Ning could
do was force it to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stratum. The
ninth battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an simple,
direct battle. Ning easily gained victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already won
nine battles in a row. One more battle. Just one more win and I’ll
have made it into the fifth stratum. Things will be much simpler
then.” Ning was feeling rather confident. Thus far, he hadn’t
encountered any foes that required him to use his Elementum
Waterflame Gourd. That was his final trump card which he would only
use when absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next challenge.”
Ning sent out yet another challenge to a cultivator on the fourth
stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s won a total
of nine victories in a row now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the twelve
astral islands within the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A skinny,
swarthy-skinned child with three eyes dressed with strange silver
cape was staring intently at the golden book in his hands. “I hear
that the almighty Hegemon personally selected this latest crop of
newcomers. It really does seem as though some of them possess
tremendous potential. This fellow who won nine battles in a row might
not necessarily be powerful, but he definitely has been the fastest
mover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden book only
included some basic information regarding the World-level cultivator
on each astral island. It didn’t include information such as
win-loss totals. Still, it wasn’t too hard to divine such
information.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, for example.
Ever since he had reached the fourth stratum, he had won every battle
he was in. He had gained a number of legacy treasures, while the ones
he had defeated had been completely drained of their own legacy
treasures! Just by watching the movements of the various legacy
treasures, one would easily be able to divine who had won which
battles. It was obvious that Ning’s total legacy treasures had
increased nine separate times after arriving on the fourth stratum,
while there were nine fourth-stratum cultivators who had lost those
exact same treasures. Clearly, he had won nine battles in a row.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty-one of the
newcomers have fought their way into the fourth stratum, but eight
ended up being pushed back into the third stratum. Some of them
managed to fight their way back into the fourth stratum once more.
Only five have won every battle they were in. The fastest has won
nine battles, while the second fastest has won six.” The skinny,
swarthy-skinned child read on. Speed didn’t count for much; the
slower ones might just be a bit more cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is rare for me to
meet a worthy opponent. Mmm… once he wins his tenth battle and
makes it into the fifth stratum, I’ll send him a challenge.” A
strange smile flashed past the child’s face. “I’ll teach him a
thing or two and let him know that there is a heaven beyond the
heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? He’s won nine
battles?” A black-robed expert on the fourth stratum was flipping
through the golden book as well. Although he was on the fourth
stratum, it had been a long, long time since anyone had challenged
him. This was because he had once made it to the fifth stratum and
thus received the protection of the Astral Islands! Making it to the
fifth stratum was a testament to his power. Most of his former
opponents now knew how strong he was and wouldn’t challenge him
without a good reason. As for the newcomers including Ning, few of
them would be so rash as to challenge someone under protection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eheh, he’s about
to make it to the fifth stratum and receive protection? It won’t be
that easy. Not just everyone is worthy of being protected. You might
be just one step away… but I will ruin your hopes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are just one
step away, but I’ll let you die in the grips of despair. Just
thinking about it excites me. Seeing a genius perish in despair is
such a lovely sight.” The black-robed expert let out a chilling
laugh as he issued Ning a challenge.

Chapter 34 - The Black-Robed Expert
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gentle wind was
blowing through the Astral Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was in an
excellent mood today. He was flipping through his golden book when
his face suddenly changed. “A challenge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had risen
to the fourth stratum, this was the first time someone else on the
same stratum had sent him a challenge! The fourth stratum was just a
single step away from the fifth stratum, causing everyone to be quite
cautious and unwilling to casually start a duel against an unknown
cultivator on the same level. They would first gather as much
intelligence as possible before deciding whether or not to challenge
the newcomer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is actually one
of the protected cultivators?” Ning frowned. “There are only
around twenty protected cultivators in all the Astral Islands! All of
them are unfathomably strong. For him to challenge me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait. I’ll wait
for a short while.” Ning shut his eyes and began to wait calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each day, a person
could only issue a single challenge. Earlier this day, he had already
issued a challenge to another member of the fourth stratum, a
cultivator who was not under protection. However, that person
wouldn’t necessarily accept his challenge. The higher the stratum,
the more cautious cultivators were about dueling people on that
stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was especially
true for fourth stratum cultivators who hadn’t received protection!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer they were to
the fifth stratum and receiving protection, the more cautious they
would become. They would generally first defeat some cultivators on
the second or third strata, but they wouldn’t kill them. Instead,
the fourth stratum cultivator would force these weaker cultivators to
swear lifeblood oaths that they would accept any challenges from him,
with him swearing that he would not take their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That way, once the
fourth stratum cultivator received a challenge from someone on his
level that he didn’t wish to fight, he could immediately issue a
challenge to those cultivators on the second and third strata,
allowing him to avoid the challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was possible to
avoid battles in this way, but unexpected things would sometimes
happen as time went on. For example, those second and third strata
cultivators might already be engaged in a duel, preventing them from
accepting the challenge from the fourth stratum cultivator. This
wouldn’t be considered a violation of the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, during the past
two weeks, Ning had only been able to successfully challenge someone
a single time. All his other challenges had been declined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope this one will
go through. Unless absolutely necessary, I’d rather not duel a
protected cultivator until I myself receive protection as well,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wasn’t
protected while his opponent was, their mental approach to any duel
would be completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time ticked on minute
by minute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden book now
displayed some new information. The cultivator which Ning challenged
had just entered into a battle against a different individual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another one avoiding
battle.” Honestly, Ning had expected this outcome. He had only
succeeded once in the past half month, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No choice but to
accept the challenge. Time for me to see just how strong these
protected individuals are.” Through the golden book, Ning was made
aware that this individual was a special lifeform, was under
protection, and had quite a few legacy treasures. Other than that,
Ning knew nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out
through the golden book and shattered the writ of challenge,
accepting the challenge. He then immediately walked towards a room
filled with many divine runes. Ning stood there in the center of the
room, allowing the formation to be activated and teleport him away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was another
oceanic island, filled with beauty and grace. Ning appeared atop a
small mountain within the island, and he immediately saw the distant,
azure-blue waters of the sea as well as the dazzling sands of the
beach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… another
figure suddenly appeared on that same mountain, just a few hundred
meters away from Ning. This was a figure that was completely covered
in black robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed figure
looked back at Ning as well. Only a pair of crimson eyes were visible
beneath his dark robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upon arriving here
at the Astral Islands, you immediately ascended to the fourth
stratum, then won nine battles in a row.” The black-robed figure’s
voice was cold and dark, and his eyes were completely different from
the eyes of a cultivator. Those crimson eyes looked even more bizarre
and sinister than the eyes of various strange beasts and monsters
which Ning had encountered in the past. This was no cultivator. It
was a special lifeform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite impressive.
Given enough time, you would definitely be able to ascend to the
fifth stratum. Unfortunately, you won’t have that chance.” The
black-robed expert laughed, and his laughter was extremely grating
and ear-piercing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha… you are
just one step away, but you are going to die here. Do you not feel
despair? Ahaha…” The black-robed expert laughed wildly, a chaotic
aura of fire beginning to emerge from his body. This aura alone was
probably capable of driving some weaker cultivators to the brink of
insanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simply frowned. No
enmity existed between the two of them, and yet this man wished to
destroy Ning’s future prospects?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You talk a big
game,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A large black
sword suddenly appeared in the black-robed expert’s right hand.
Although it could be described as a sword, it didn’t have any edges
to it at all. The aura emanating from this greatsword gave Ning an
impression of incredible weight and density.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, I dare make
these claims because I have the power to take your life. You simply
haven’t been here in the Astral Islands long enough, and you
haven’t undergone sufficient tempering. There is no place in the
outside world which is quite like the Astral Islands, with its many
elites and geniuses for you to test yourself against. I think you
won’t be able to take so much as my very first sword-blow.” The
black-robed expert let out a bizarre laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
gaze turned sharp, and a crimson-gold lightning seal suddenly
appeared on his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was beginning to
get rather irritated by this black-robed expert’s words. Screw the
talking; he was going to give this person a taste of his [Novessence
Thunder] first!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! A crimson-gold
streak of lightning shot out with incredible speed, giving the
black-robed expert no time to dodge at all. The lightning bolt
hammered directly against him, causing his body to tremble slightly.
However, he was still able to stand there calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What powerful
lightning. Unfortunately, I’m the wrong person for you to use it
against.” The black-robed expert completely ignored the [Novessence
Thunder], allowing it to crackle and writhe around his body. A few
flickers of lightning brushed against some of the nearby boulders,
instantly reducing them to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can die now.”
The black-robed expert struck out with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
be too brash. This person knew that he had won nine battles in a row
on the fourth stratum, but still dared to make the claim that his
very first sword-blow would be too much for Ning to handle. Without a
doubt, this strike would be an extraordinary one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Once this strike
was unleashed, the skies above the oceanic island began to dim.
Countless flaming clouds began to gather in the air above them , and
the sword crushed down upon Ning as though it was bringing the might
of Heaven and Earth down with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword came crashing
down towards Ning with a feeling of absolute, immeasurable
ponderance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Allgod stance!” A
cold, fierce light flashed through Ning’s eyes as well as he
unleashed the most dominating, explosive sword stance he possessed.
As Ning’s insights into the sword had risen, his Allgod stance had
become increasingly extraordinary as well. It was now able to unleash
a truly significant amount of the might of Violetjewel’s
quintessence core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
manifested [Three Heads, Six Arms]. His six swords transformed into
six blood-colored wyrms that howled towards the massive world-sword
that was crashing down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!! When the first
blood-colored wyrm slammed into the greatsword, the blood-colored
wyrm was brought to a halt but the greatsword was knocked flying
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
black-robed expert let out a startled shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He does have a bit
of power. No wonder he bragged so much.” Ning was secretly
startled. Thanks to the azureflower mist energy, Ning was as strong
as a Daolord of the First Step and far above the vast majority of
World-level cultivators. He was also using an Eternal weapon and had
unleashed his most powerful sword-stance, a strike which was so
powerful that very few were capable of withstanding it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet… that
black-robed expert’s greatsword had managed to halt his strike in
its tracks! But of course, it had only been able to block Ning’s
first strike. Ning had six Eternal weapons he was using!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although one of the
blood-colored wyrms had been destroyed, the other five continued to
surge forward towards the black-robed expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can…” The
black-robed expert was absolutely stunned. A blazing crimson warblade
appeared in his other hand, a saber that gave off a similar aura of
incredible ponderance. He joined his saber and his sword in front of
him, using them to block Ning’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five blood wyrms
came crashing down with enough power to shake the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire mountain
they were on actually collapsed, and the island itself split apart as
the ground below the strike was completely caved in. As for the
black-robed expert, Ning had already smashed him down into the very
bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Moments later,
the black-robed expert came charging out of the waters of the sea. He
hovered there in midair, staring at the distant Ji Ning who was
standing atop a gray boulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You talked a big
game, but you don’t have much to back it up.” Ning let out a
chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” The
black-robed expert was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a reason for
his earlier braggadocio. He was an extremely powerful special
lifeform, and despite being at the World level he was completely
capable of unleashing a level of power comparable to that of a
Daolord of the First Step. Given that his two Eternal weapons were
also quite suited to him and to unleashing the type of power he
specialized in, most fourth stratum foes would never dare to take his
blows head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was why he had
felt so confident in his abilities! What he didn’t realize was that
for many years now, the way Ning had fought was by directly crushing
his foes with overwhelming power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your swords are
quite powerful, and you are just as strong as I am.” The
black-robed expert’s voice began to transform, turning low and
gravelly. As for his crimson eyes, they began to be filled with an
even more insane look than before. “You are now qualified to see my
true form.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around the
black-robed expert suddenly became filled with endless tendrils of
dark-red flames. He was like the god of this world of flames, and his
black robes suddenly vanished, revealing the form underneath…

Chapter 35 - A Miserable Victory
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a humanoid
creature whose skin was completely pitch-black. His eyes were crimson
red in color, and the way in which he stared at Ji Ning made Ning
feel uncomfortable. This pitch-black humanoid’s skin suddenly began
to crack and split apart, revealing a dim crimson substance beneath
the skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pop! Every so often, a
piece of that crimson material would suddenly shoot out from beneath
his skin, moving vastly beyond the speed of light and causing
spacetime around it to twist and distort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The creature simply
stood there, allowing his ‘skin’ to crack and pop. Every so
often, more of that crimson substance would shoot out. Whenever it
touched the waters of the ocean, the water would begin to hiss and
boil away. Whenever it touched the the remnants of the island, the
island would shudder and break apart even further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve forced me
to reveal my true form, which means you have to die. You are indeed
qualified to make it to the fifth stratum, but unfortunately for you…
you ran into me.” The sable creature spoke in a hoarse voice, and a
few flecks of that crimson material flew out from his mouth with each
word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you the
ugly one,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sable creature was
both embarrassed and enraged. Cultivators were the true masters of
the Endless Territories, after all. They were simply too numerous!
Even though he was an incredibly powerful special lifeform, when he
was born from the primordial chaos he found himself to be the only
member of his race. Thus, he changed his appearance and always wore a
black robe, spending his life within the world of cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, even he
himself felt that his true appearance was rather ugly. However, only
by revealing his true form was he capable of unleashing his full
power. There was nothing else he could do. When normal cultivators
insulted him, he wouldn’t be that irritated, but the person who
just spoke was a powerful cultivator who was on his general level of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you can do is
flap your mouth. Remember this in your next life. The person who
killed you is Sabafey.” The sable creature let out a low growl as
he gripped the heavy warblade and the heavy greatsword with his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an ugly name as
well.” Ning was intentionally mocking him. He could tell that this
special lifeform had a fairly weak Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Two sonorous
streaks of saber-light and sword-light struck out, carrying an aura
of incredible majesty and power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning once
more manifested three heads and six arms, using his six Eternal
weapons fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? What’s this?”
When Ning transformed into a streak of lightning and charged forward,
he immediately sensed spacetime twisting around him. This had an
impact on even his own agility and movements. Clearly, this Sabafey
was capable of causing spacetime to twist all around him in a
domain-type maneuver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning let
out an angry snort as that streak of crimson-gold lightning once more
blasted out of his forehead. The lightning was shaped like a Flood
Dragon as it struck out, but once it moved closer to that black
humanoid, it was impacted by some of the crimson substance spurting
out of its cracked skin. The crimson-gold lightning instantly began
to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We haven’t even
clashed yet, but that crimson substance shooting out of his body and
this domain around him is already having an impact on my abilities.
So this is the power of his true form?” Ning was secretly nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of black light
suddenly shot out. This was the sable freak, Sabafey!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of lightning
shot out as well. This was the three-headed, six-armed, white-robed
Ji Ning. Crimson-gold lightning continuously shot out of Ning’s
forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly
clashed multiple times in midair, causing the air around them to
tremble, the fragments of the island beneath them to sink deeper into
the sea, and tremendous tidal waves to arise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them battled
in a wild orgy of destruction, and Ji Ning was clearly at a
disadvantage in this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was forced to
repeatedly dodge backwards, then charge forward once more. As for the
black freak Sabafey, he fought in an utterly dominating fashion.
Although he only had a single warblade and a single greatsword, his
strength and savagery was enough to allow his two weapons to
completely overwhelm Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the unique
spacetime domain surrounding this creature was enough to make him
superior to Ning in speed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So his true form
makes him this much stronger than before.” Ning could feel how
difficult this battle was becoming. The power of every single blow
from the enemy’s sword and saber was superior to Ning’s power.
Even though Ning had six weapons to his foe’s two, he was still at
a marked disadvantage in this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this special
lifeform was indeed as physically strong as a Daolord of the First
Step. He was on par with Ji Ning, and his insights into the Dao were
even more profound than Ning’s. This was the reason why the power
of his every blow exceeded Ning’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for their earlier
clash? Before revealing his true form and unleashing his full power,
he looked just like an ordinary cultivator dressed in black robes. He
had only been able to unleash roughly ten or twenty percent of his
maximum power in that state, which was why his full-strength blow was
merely on par with one of Ning’s sword-strikes. Things were
completely different now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are definitely
going to die. You are gonna die!” Sabafey’s hoarse, maddened
voice rang out. He held an advantage in both speed and power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
since arriving at the Astral Islands that Ning had been in such a
terrible situation. He was being completely dominated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was someone who
was just as fast and as strong as him, but who also had an even
higher level of insight into the Dao. Sabafey had been training here
at the Astral Islands for an extremely long period of time, and he
possessed that strange domain which was even stronger than Ning’s
[Novessence Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was being crushed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes, if
you always stay on the defensive, sooner or later you will lose. Ning
no longer dared to let things continue like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out!” Ning
was furious as well. This Sabafey really was trying to kill him and
sever his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-crimson gourd
suddenly appeared out of nowhere next to Ning. This was the Elementum
Waterflame Gourd! The gourd hovered behind Ning, then instantly spat
out two streaks of dragon-shaped lightning. One streak of lightning
was the Watersmoke Lightning, and it looked a flood of black water
descending from an enormous stormcloud. The power of this lightning
was so tremendous that it alone was superior to Ning’s [Novessence
Thunder]. As for the second streak of lightning, it looked like a
cloud of flame and was just as strong as the first streak of
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of
lightning. The first was Watersmoke Lightning, the second was
Firecloud lightning. Fire and water were incompatible by nature! They
were opposing forces! But these two streaks of Dao lightning
simultaneously coiled around each other as they thundered towards the
sable freak, Sabafey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is that?!”
The sable creature was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two streaks of Dao
lightning showed no mercy at all. They simultaneously hammered down
upon the sable creature, then began smashing into each other as well.
As the two streaks of fiery lightning and watery lightning collided,
they unleashed an utterly ruinous level of explosive power that
caused even Ning himself to be in awe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even most supreme World
Gods would be instantly slain by such an attack. As for transcendent
World Gods, they would be heavily injured at the very least. A few
consecutive blows would ensure that they would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Daolords of the
First Step would be able to endure such a blow, but even they would
be heavily restricted and bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! The two
streaks of Dao lightning furiously swirled around the sable
creature’s body, and each time they collided they released
tremendous amounts of power, causing Sabafey’s speed and strength
to both fall dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Dao
lightning!” Sabafey called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes it is.” Ning
charged forward once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if you have
Dao lightning? It can at most slow me down. It can’t kill me!”
Sabafey remained as ferocious and savage as ever. His true body was
indeed comparable to that of a Daolord of the First Step, allowing
him to endure the strikes of these two types of Dao lightning.
However, he was still hindered tremendously by them. He was now
slightly slower than Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! His
warblade and his greatsword still held roughly half of their former
level of power. He was still able to crush Ning in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, things were now
much simpler for Ning. Now that he had an advantage in speed, he was
able to advance and withdraw at his leisure. In addition, his foe’s
advantage in strength was now much smaller than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
battle ferociously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am a special
lifeform. This cultivator has to be using his divine power at an
incredible rate. He won’t be able to hang on for much longer, while
I’ll be able to keep going for quite some time.” Sabafey was
filled with confidence. He was certain he would be able to keep
fighting for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single drop of
my azureflower mist energy represents the distillation of all my
divine power, heartforce, and Immortal energy. I’m not using any
particularly powerful divine abilities for this fight. I’ll be able
to go on for ages. This special lifeform has to be using some sort of
secret art which allows him to release tremendous amounts of power,
but I’m certain he won’t be able to maintain it for too long.”
Ning was filled with confidence as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was merely using
[Three Heads, Six Arms]. This divine ability used up fairly little
divine power. Ning was mainly relying on his azureflower mist energy
in this battle, and it wasn’t being used up that quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle went on for
more than two full hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, both were
very confident. As time went on, both Sabafey and Ning grew
increasingly amazed. By now, Ning only had sixteen drops of his
azureflower mist energy left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat!”
Finally, Sabafey let out a disgruntled growl. “Given how much power
you have unleashed, you have to be using up divine power at an
incredible rate. How is it even possible for you to continue fighting
for this long? How?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was using
abilities like the [Starseizing Hand], he would indeed be using up
divine power at an astonishing rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had won. Finally, he
had won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense the
golden book in his possession begin to transform. He was now under
the protection of the Astral Islands, which acknowledged the fact
that he had just won ten battles in a row on the fourth island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over your
legacy treasures.” Ning stared at him. If it wasn’t for the fact
that this person was also under protection, Ning would’ve shown him
no mercy at all and slain him. This person wasn’t going to be able
to hold on for much longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be smug. I
was defeated by the others on the fifth stratum, after all.”
Sabafey let out a hoarse growl. “There are many on the fifth
stratum who are stronger than me. You are indeed quite strong, but
your insights into the sword are quite mediocre. Ahaha… you are
even inferior to a special lifeform like myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he waved
his hand and tossed out a large amount of legacy treasures. Upon
losing, he had to hand over everything he had unless Ning voluntarily
accepted less. He didn’t dare violate the rules of the Astral
Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EXIT!” Sabafey
raised his head and let out an angry shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Spacetime
twisted around him, causing his sable form to disappear into thin
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting the many legacy treasures. His golden book immediately
sent him an alert, informing him that he had already acquired a full
legacy and that he was permitted to leave the Astral Islands whenever
he wished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A full set?” Ning
wasn’t that surprised. He knew that Sabafey had many legacy
treasures on him, including a full legacy set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand
again, causing the Elementum Waterflame Gourd to fly towards him as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put away the
gourd. If it hadn’t been for this gourd he probably would’ve lost
this fight, even if he was able to keep himself alive. Upon losing,
he would’ve been knocked down to the third stratum once more, where
he would’ve had to slowly accumulate enough wins for another
promotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sabafalle. He was
merely an individual who wasn’t strong enough to stay in the fifth
stratum permanently. He was beaten down into the fourth stratum…
and yet, he is incredibly powerful. My sword-arts are indeed a weak
point.” Prior to this, Ning didn’t fully realize how great a
weakness this was. However, the more he battled against other
incredibly talented figures, the more he realized how lacking his
sword-arts were. In the end, he simply hadn’t spent enough time as
a World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many of the
cultivators on the fifth stratum are more powerful than him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flicker of
battle-lust appeared in Ning’s eyes. “Good. The stronger they
are, the better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head
and called out, “Exit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime twisted
around Ning, causing him to be teleported away and back to his own
astral island.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six strata of
astral islands continuously circled around each other in a very
orderly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very top
stratum, the sixth stratum, there was just a single astral island.
The fifth stratum had a total of twelve astral islands that slowly
circled each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the hundred-plus
islands belonging to the fourth stratum began to slowly fly upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone made it to
the fifth stratum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many cultivators on
the lower strata of the Astral Islands all raised their heads to
stare at the higher-level islands. Hundreds of thousands of them were
watching as this particular island ascended from the fourth stratum
to the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many cultivators felt
complicated feelings in their heart. They dreamed of being able to
make it to the fifth stratum. That way, they would similarly be able
to receive the protection of the Astral Islands! Alas, this was far,
far too difficult a task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A change in
destiny…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what countless
cultivators were murmuring silently to themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was quite fast.
He was brought here alongside the rest of us in this batch, but he
actually made it to the fifth stratum before I did.” A jade-haired
woman dressed in silvery, semi-translucent gauze was murmuring to
herself softly from within her island on the fourth stratum. “And a
cultivator at that. I’ve never ever met any World-level cultivators
who are a match for me, but almost as soon as I arrived in the
Brightshore Kingdom I encountered one. How intriguing. What’s more,
the Brightshore Kingdom treats cultivators and special lifeforms
equally, giving no special preferences or advantages to either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I like this place.”
A smile appeared on the jade-haired woman’s face as natural mist
began to swirl around her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that those puny cultivators would give rise to someone who
might be a match for me. He actually made it to the fifth stratum
before I did.” A devilishly handsome silver-haired youth was
murmuring softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a member of the
Aeonians who had long ago found the path he needed to take to become
a Samsara Daolord. However, he wanted to become more powerful before
doing so. That way, he would benefit even further from his Awakening
of his Aeonian bloodlines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, he had to admit
that the Brightshore Kingdom truly had gathered many freakishly
talented figures. The fourth stratum alone was filled with many
figures who had been quite difficult for him to overcome. This made
him quite cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone capable of
surging into the fifth stratum so quickly was definitely a powerful
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although cultivators
are individually weak, there’s simply too many of them. There are
far more of them around than we Aeonians. In the end, the law of
large numbers means they will give birth to many freakishly strong
figures.” The silver-haired youth mused to himself, “Once I enter
the fifth stratum, I’ll definitely have to test him out myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ascension to
the fifth stratum did indeed arouse the interest of quite a few of
the other freakishly talented World-level cultivators. The ability to
make it into the fifth stratum was a testament to his strength!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another person has
joined us in the fifth stratum?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. A few
days from now, I’ll have to give him a challenge and see how he
does.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wager that
Kilostar will be the first challenger yet again. Ahh, forget it. Just
let it be him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stratum and
the fifth stratum were completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators on the
fourth stratum weren’t under any protection. As a result, they
would rarely accept or issue challenges. They were all quite
cautious. However, these twelve peerless geniuses on the fifth
stratum were all incredibly strong and talented figures. This was why
they were able to keep their positions within the fifth stratum
stable. Even if they occasionally fell down to the next level, they
would quickly rise up once more. All of them delighted in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the entire
reason why they were still here was because they wanted to keep
fighting!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the legacies?
There was no point in being greedy. They merely needed to local the
ones they actually needed. The best part of being here was the
ability to battle against all these World-level cultivators. The
experience they gained through combat was quite useful to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An astral island within
the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A skinny, swarthy child
dressed in a silver cape was flipping through his golden book,
roaring with laughter. “Ahahah! He didn’t disappoint me. He
actually beat that special lifeform named Sabafalle. Although
Sabafalle is a bit of an idiot, beating him is no easy task.
Interesting, interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, simply
defeating Sabafalle doesn’t mean much. Sabafalle is completely
incapable of standing stably amongst the ranks of the other fifth
stratum individuals. Kid, I’m going to teach you the true meaning
of the phrase, ‘there is always someone stronger than the strong’.”
The skinny, swarthy child laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenge issued!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He issued a direct
challenge to Ning through the golden book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh… the
other eleven fellows on the fifth stratum will all give me some face.
Same as always! I’ll be the first to challenge the newcomer.” A
look of excitement was in the swarthy-skinned child’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had lived
together for quite some time. They had formed certain habits long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time a newcomer
made it to the fifth stratum for the first time, it would be Kilostar
who would challenge that person first. Kilostar wasn’t necessarily
the most powerful of the twelve, but he had the fewest weaknesses. He
was capable of dealing with any foes that appeared. Even if he had to
fight against that terrifying fellow from the sixth stratum, he’d
still be able to at least keep himself safe! In other words… he was
capable of dealing with any World-level cultivator, no matter how
freakishly talented that person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark abyss directly
below the hundreds of thousands of astral islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very bottom of
the abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss. Crackle. Nine
strange flames were flickering here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the flames was a
horizontally placed longspear that was over a thousand meters long.
An enormous haunch of meat that was at least three hundred meters
long was currently spitted on the spear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beast’s flesh was
being slowly roasted by the nine flames, and its surface was just
slowly turning red. To fully cook it would probably take quite some
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Delicious.
Absolutely delicious.” A burly, nearly-naked man with tousled black
hair was seated, dressed in simple battle garbs. In front of him was
a large basin that was over thirty meters long, filled with roasted
meat. He was chomping through the meat with relish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sitting opposite of him
was a muscular golden-haired man dressed in golden armor. This man
also had an enormous basin front of him, also filled with roasted
meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Wu, your
hunting skills really aren’t bad. This Bloodflame Dragon had to be
comparable to a Verge-level Daolord. Its flesh is simply savory.”
The golden-armored warrior was crunching his way through the meat as
he spoke. Not just anyone was powerful enough to chew through this!
“Hunting these things really isn’t easy. I think you Imperials
must have damn near wiped them out of the Endless Territories by
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We pretty much wiped
them out ages ago.” The black-haired, nearly-naked man shook his
head. “The Hegemon, that old bastard, captured more than anyone
else. He’s able to instantly teleport to any territory he pleases,
whereas I actually had to physically run across countless territories
before I was able to find a single Bloodflame Dragon. I then had to
pretend to be a cultivator, for fear that once it realized who I was
it would self-destruct rather than let me capture it. It took forever
for me to capture it! Ehehe… but now that I have one, I can slowly
savor it for an extremely long period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodflame Dragons were
incredibly, terrifyingly powerful beasts. They were unlike
cultivators or Aeonians; they neither used divine power nor had any
Immortal energy. They were actually similar to bugbeasts, but they
were far more powerful than bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was
incredibly rare for one of them to be found in the Endless
Territories. They had been driven to the point of extinction long
ago, precisely because the Brightshore Imperials’ favorite food was
Bloodflame Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Bloodflame Dragon
which had reached the Verge of the Daomerge had a body that was
comparable in size to an entire chaos star. If you ate just a
thousand meters of it with each meal, you would be able to able to
feast for an extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, ancient creatures
such as the members of the Brightshore Imperials would live for even
longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Wu.” The
golden-armored warrior glanced off into the distance towards a
strange beast that was wreathed in flames. This creature possessed
tremendous vitality and power, but it was currently suffering all
sorts of unspeakable torments. “I heard that you Imperials just
gained a new clansmen. Shouldn’t you take his training a bit more
seriously?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For me to even keep
an eye out for him is me being much more serious than usual. Yeah,
this abyss is filled with plenty of danger, but so long as I keep an
eye out I’ll be able to guarantee that he stays alive,” the
black-haired man said between mouthfuls of meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-haired man suddenly raised his head to stare upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His gaze pierced
through the darkness of the abyss as well as the protection of the
Astral Islands, allowing him to see Ji Ning. Ji Ning was currently
flipping through his golden book within his room in his astral
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
Ning suddenly found himself seized by an invisible, inexplicable
terror. It was as though some terrifying creature had just taken
notice of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems a new kid
is about to join your Twelve Palaces as well.” The black-haired man
looked towards the golden-armored warrior. “He made it to the fifth
stratum quite quickly, and he’s a cultivator just like you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not bad, I
suppose.” The golden-armored man laughed. “We cultivators are
fairly weak in general. It is quite rare for an extremely powerful
cultivator to emerge. We simply can’t compare to the members of
your race. All of you are born with utterly enormous power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that comparable?
Is that even comparable?!” The black-haired man glared at him. “How
many of you are there? How few of us are there? The Hegemon, that old
bastard… how much time does he need to spend wandering the Endless
Territories before he is able to find another member of our race? For
each new member of our race that is born, another ten Daolords emerge
amongst you cultivators. You cultivators give birth to monsters by
the bundle. Just look at the Twelve Palaces. How many Daolords do you
have? And how few members do we have in our imperial clan?”

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sometimes, I really
envy you cultivators. There is a stupid large number of you. You guys
are absolutely everywhere. Every single territory has you cultivators

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“THAT BRAT! Is he
trying to die?!” The black-haired man’s eyes suddenly bulged out.
Two streaks of golden light shot out of his eyes, passing through the
barriers of spacetime and reaching a distant figure in a distant
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Astral Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
Ning’s entire body had turned stiff. He felt as though an utterly
terrifying presence had suddenly taken notice of him. However, that
terrifying sense of danger quickly dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was that just
now?” Ning guessed that it had to have been an incredibly powerful
figure who was scrying upon him, a figure that didn’t even bother
to hide his aura. If he had, there was no way Ning would’ve been
able to sense him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sense of
danger… it was second only to the sensation I felt when I
encountered that terrifying behemoth that brought me here,” Ning
mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying behemoth
that had devoured him and brought him to this place was the most
terrifying thing Ning had ever encountered in his life. It vastly
surpassed any and all experts Ning had encountered in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was an organization that was on the same general level of power as
the entire Dao Alliance itself. The Dao Alliance was unfathomably
powerful, while the Brightshore Kingdom was very secretive and quite
powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t matter, I
guess. Either of them can crush me like a bug.” Ning couldn’t be
bothered to worry about it. The point of the almighty Hegemon
bringing them here was to raise a crop of powerful cultivators. Even
the most powerful of organizations would need constant injections of
fresh blood, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how powerful
their elite experts were, only their Eternal Emperors would live
eternally. Samsara Daolords who did not succeed in the Daomerge would
all perish eventually. Thus, they needed to ensure a constant, steady
stream of new blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was one of them, a
future expert of the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Fortunately,
Youji is still alive.” Ning flipped through the golden book again,
then let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Someone just
challenged me?” Ning frowned. One of the talented geniuses of the
fifth stratum had just issued him a challenge. It must be understood
that the twelve members of the fifth stratum had been on that stratum
for a long period of time. They were all definitely superior to
Sabafalle in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been forced to
pull out his Elementum Waterflame Gourd for the sake of defeating
Sabafalle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m currently
protected by the Astral Islands. Even if I lose, I would at most lose
some legacy treasures. However… I need to make sure this set gets
to Su Youji first. If too much time passes, something unexpected
might happen.” Ning didn’t dare to be too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
Whoosh! Three hundred and twenty legacy treasures suddenly appeared
before him. These were all fiery red leaves. The fiery leaves were
all gathered together, and Ning could immediately sense the
tremendous amount of information they contained, as well as that
blazingly powerful aura of fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a legacy
pertaining to the Dao of Fire. Sabafalle, Ning’s previous opponent,
had walked the Dao of Fire. The reason he had kept these legacy
treasures with him was so that he could be in constant contact with
the blazing will they contained. However, the treasures had now
fallen into Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he had to do was
swear a lifeblood oath and he would immediately be able to study this
legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did end up
learning it, but he simply memorized its contents. This legacy was
indeed quite profound and remarkable. Just by reviewing the entire
legacy from start to finish, Ning’s insights into the Dao of Fire
increased substantially, reaching a level of near-parity with his Dao
of Water or his Dao of Thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Possession of a
legacy really does make a big difference,” Ning mused to himself.
“Still, my Dao is the Dao of the Sword. I can’t waste my time and
energy on fire.” Ning quickly buried this legacy into another
corner of his mind. He had simply memorized it to gain a bit of
additional experience, as all Daos shared certain commonalities. This
legacy contained many abstruse mysteries that would be of some use to
Ning in his mastery of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to challenge
her.” After looking through the legacy treasure, Ning nodded
silently to himself. Su Youji was quite talented in the Dao of Fire.
If he gave this to her, it would be of tremendous benefit to her in
mastering the Dao of Fire. She would improve quite quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent Su Youji a
challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope she accepts.
She has to accept.” Ning was rather worried and nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had learned the
location of Su Youji’s astral island from Daolord Flameflow, but Su
Youji didn’t know that Ning had reached the fifth stratum. If she
suddenly saw someone from the fifth stratum challenge her, would she
accept?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she did not, then
Ning would have to accept this duel from Kilostar, his fifth stratum
challenger. If he won, that was one thing, but if he lost… his
legacy treasures would all be gone as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wouldn’t be too
hard for Ning to get another set of legacy treasures, but to get
another set that was of the Dao of Fire which Su Youji could use
would be quite difficult. In addition, if too much time passed… Su
Youji might perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bottom stratum of
the hundreds of thousands of astral islands. One of the islands was
covered with plants and flowers. This was a very beautiful island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji, dressed in
fiery red robes, was lying within the grass, staring at the skies. A
look of exhaustion was on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this keeps up, I
really won’t be able to endure for much longer. Master… I
probably won’t be able to accompany you for much longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji lay there in
the grass, utterly exhausted. She truly had almost no energy left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had given her
his bugbeasts and his set of Hellwind Golems. At first, she had
indeed been able to win quite a few battles in a row with ease. On
the first stratum, there really weren’t that many who were a match
for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But soon, trouble began
to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News that she had many
bugbeasts and a set of Hellwind Golems quickly began to spread. There
were many powerful World-level cultivators who wanted those bugbeasts
and those powerful golems!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, there
wasn’t a significant difference in power between cultivators on the
third stratum and those on the fourth stratum. If they had a set of
Hellwind Golems helping them out, a third stratum cultivator might be
able to charge into the fourth stratum and have a chance at acquiring
a full legacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Especially for those
who specialized in close combat, a set of Hellwind Golems and a host
of bugbeasts would allow them to become far stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the World-level
cultivators who had been living here at the Astral Islands for a long
time knew each other. At critical times, they would issue each other
challenges to avoid dangerous battles. Thus, in the end there were
three powerful World-level cultivators who found out about the golems
and the bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of these three came
from the third floor, with one coming from the fourth floor. All of
them furiously challenged Su Youji day in and day out. Su Youji did
her best to avoid them. When she could not, she would go fight the
ones on the third floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was able to hold
on for a few times… but how much longer will I be able to hold?”
Su Youji mumbled to herself. She had been here for more than half a
year, and the past few months had been an utter nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sudenly, an island
ascended from the fourth stratum to the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stratum?”
Su Youji’s eyes lit up. “A cultivator reached the fifth stratum?
Could it be Master?” She deeply hoped that it was Ning, but she
knew that there were many individuals of tremendous talent and skill
amongst the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope it is Master.
So long as Master can stay alive… that is enough.” Su Youji
prayed silently. She didn’t hope for Ning to rescue her. Logically
speaking, there was no way for Ning to even find out which island she
was on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as her thoughts
were racing, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A challenge?” Su
Youji could sense that yet another challenge had been sent to her
golden book. She remained quite calm, because she received challenges
every single day. Her bugbeasts and golems were simply too
irresistible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A challenge from the
fifth stratum?” Su Youji was badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her bugbeasts and
golems were indeed attractive, but it made no sense for those
protected freaks on the fifth stratum to take an interest in them.
Prior to this, the highest-level challenge had come from someone on
the fourth stratum, and that had been her only challenge from that
stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? It seems… to
be from that person who just made it to the fifth stratum?” Su
Youji quickly noticed this. Every day, she would go through the
golden book, and she recognized the twelve markers that originally
belonged to the fifth stratum islands. Given her memory as a Chaos
Immortal, she was naturally able to memorize those twelve at once.
The person who had just challenged her was not one of the twelve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person
challenged me immediately after reaching the fifth stratum? If this
person has already received protection, it makes no sense for him to
be interested in my bugbeasts and golems. Could it… truly be
Master?” Many thoughts flashed through Su Youji’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t dare to
believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She felt that it was
all wishful thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… she also had
the vague feeling that it really could be her master. Logically
speaking, there was no reason for a newly ascended fifth stratum
expert to immediately issue a challenge to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Could it be that
Master had a way to discover the astral island which I am on?” Su
Youji hesitated for a long moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw it. I’m at
the brink of collapse anyhow. Even if it really is an enemy, I’d be
satisfied with my defeat coming at the hands of someone on the fifth
stratum.” Su Youji gritted her teeth, then accepted the challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She quickly entered a
room in her island covered by divine runes. As the runes lit up and
activated, spacetime began to twist around her as she was teleported
off of the astral island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was yet another
oceanic island. There was a volcano on this island that was belching
lava and flames, causing the island to be covered with a layer of
grimy soot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji appeared out
of nowhere. She immediately saw a figure off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure carrying a
sword on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Su
Youji’s body trembled slightly as she murmured these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” The figure
turned and looked at her.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 38 - Kilostar
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s eyes
instantly reddened. She was both shocked and delighted. Her heart was
filled with many complex emotions. She felt excited for Ji Ning upon
realizing that he had fought his way through so many World-level
cultivators to make it to the fifth stratum, and also celebrated for
herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The exhaustion and
pressure she felt was all wiped away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” Ning’s
form blurred as he transformed into a streak of light that flew to
her side. He looked at her carefully. “What’s wrong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. I’m just
so happy.” Su Youji finally smiled, and her smile was absolutely
incandescent. She now looked like her old self again. “If you came
just a bit later, Master, you probably wouldn’t be able to find
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning was shocked. “You are on the first stratum. Those bugbeasts
and golems should’ve been enough to let you hang on for quite some
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against the first
stratum cultivators, I would’ve been, yes. But third stratum and
fourth stratum cultivators often send me challenges.” Su Youji said
helplessly, “I can’t even avoid them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third and fourth
stratum? There are so many cultivators on the first stratum. Why
would they single you… shit!” Ning turned pale. He realized what
had happened. He had given her those bugbeasts and golems with the
best of intentions, but the road to hell is paved with good
intentions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here at the Astral
Islands, whenever someone was discovered to be in possession of good
treasures that person would often find himself targeted. What, then,
of such a powerful set of golems and bugbeasts? Although it was hard
for most of the cultivators here to send each other messages, there
were indeed a few alliances and partnership. It made sense that word
would eventually spread to the third and fourth strata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I screwed up.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t your
fault, Master. Even I didn’t realize what was going to happen. Only
later on did I understand how badly they wanted my golems and
bugbeasts,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must have been
exhausted.” Ning could imagine how life had been for her recently.
Those third and fourth strata cultivators had assuredly done
everything they could to try and force Su Youji to fight them.
Although she had struggled and fought back, how long would she be
able to do so? As more time passed, most likely there would be even
more powerful cultivators who would take interest in her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.”
Ning suddenly spoke out in a high voice, his words echoing within the
air above the volcanic island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat in my
duel against you.” Ning laughed. “This set of legacy treasures is
for you. Don’t you need any other treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji suddenly
realized what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up. This set
of legacy treasures is useless to me, and I’ve already received the
protection of the Astral Islands.” Ning laughed as he waved his
hand, causing the three hundred and twenty leaves filled with the Dao
of Fire to float over towards Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji immediately
waved her hand to accept this legacy. She had won this battle. If she
wanted to do so, she could demand that Ning hand over all of his
legacy treasures. But of course, since she was going to leave the
Astral Islands there was absolutely no point to acquiring more of
these legacy treasures. You had to acquire a full set in order to
gain a legacy, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Now that
you have a full legacy, hurry up and leave the Astral Islands,”
Ning instructed. “This place is far too dangerous for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For someone like Su
Youji, this was indeed an incredibly dangerous place. Without the
bugbeasts, she was at high risk of death. With the bugbeasts and
golems, she became the target of even more powerful cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
felt many complex emotions in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also. Once you leave
the Astral Islands, do your best to enter the Twelve Palaces,” Ning
said. “At present, you most likely aren’t strong enough to
attract their interest. However, now that you have this legacy,
you’ll be able to grow much more powerful. Focus on your
cultivation, and if the opportunity arises you should do your best to
enter the palaces. In the future, I will join the Twelve Palaces as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve Palaces?”
Su Youji was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most powerful
organization in the Brightshore Kingdom. At the very apex of the
Brightshore Kingdom stands its Twelve Palaces and its imperial clan.”
Ning gave her a simple explanation. “You only acquired a full
legacy thanks to my assistance, and so the Twelve Palaces won’t
grant you automatic entry. You’ll need to train hard and undergo
many trials before being permitted to enter the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji knew her own limits. To even escape this place alive was a
stroke of tremendous luck. She didn’t daydream about being granted
automatic entry into the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my talisman.
Keep it with you at all times, and I’ll be able to sense your
location. After I leave the Astral Islands, I’ll go find you.” As
Ning spoke, he handed out a jade talisman to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji accepted the
jade talisman. It was slick and cold in her hands. She nodded slowly.
“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Be careful
once you enter the rest of the Brightshore Kingdom,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. After
what happened here, I’m going to be even more careful in the
future. Besides… even if the outside world is a dangerous place, it
can’t possibly be as dangerous as these astral islands.” Su Youji
chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two, master and
retainer, didn’t have too long to chat. In the end, they had to
part once more as they were each teleported to their own astral
islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji first
memorized the entire legacy, then chose to depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That bitch actually
acquired a full legacy and left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That freak who made
it to the fifth stratum lost to her on purpose? No wonder she had
such valuable bugbeasts and golems. It must’ve been that freak who
gave it to her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think that
freak who made it to the fifth stratum will take revenge on us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in trouble
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators who had
been eyeing Su Youji and repeatedly challenging her for her treasures
all began to grow restless and uneasy. However, neither Ning nor Su
Youji were interested in revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Su Youji had
been driven to the brink of despair, she didn’t feel any hatred for
them. She knew that they were also struggling to survive. When they
encountered anything that could help them or increase their chances
of acquiring a full set of legacy treasures, it was only natural for
them to do anything they could to win it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Su youji saw it, she
had already escaped from this sea of bitterness, whereas all of her
tormentors were still struggling. In all the hundreds of thousands of
astral islands, only those twenty or so figures who had received the
protection of the Astral Islands would be truly at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He made it up,
then fell down again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually lost
that set of legacy treasures to a first stratum cultivator?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the cultivators
kept a tight watch on their golden books, and they noticed whenever
any changes appeared. They were able to almost instantly scan through
the information pertaining to all of the islands, and they quickly
realized that one particular island now contained a legacy treasure
pertaining to the Dao of Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone on the fifth
stratum had lost to someone on the first stratum? And that person
just so happened to now have a legacy of the Dao of Fire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lost on purpose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, why don’t I
have friends like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s astral island
sank from the fifth stratum to the fourth stratum once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar, the
cultivator on the fifth stratum, was a bit irritated by this. He had
sent Ji Ning a challenge, but in the end Ji Ning had actually chosen
to battle Su Youji instead. “He actually avoided my challenge and
delivered his legacy treasure to a cultivator on the first stratum?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I’ll keep
challenging him. Let’s see if he has the balls to accept. If he
does, I’ll hold him in some respect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day, Kilostar
once more sent Ning a challenge. This time, Ning didn’t decline.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now under the
protection of the Astral Islands, after all. He was brimming with
confidence and the desire to do battle. He wanted to see just how
powerful the freaks of the fifth stratum were. Kilostar was also a
cultivator, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were both
teleported to a black oceanic island. They stared at each other from
afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar had the
appearance of a skinny, swarthy-skinned child. His silver cape
fluttered in the breeze, and as soon as the battle began Kilostar
transformed into a thousand clones. This sight instantly caused
Ning’s face to tighten. “That’s the [Thousand Bodies Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just so. This is the
[Thousand Bodies Sutra].” Kilostar’s thousand clones were capable
of joining together into a strange formation akin to a Thousand Elder
Gods Formation. Ning was completely surrounded by Kilostar’s
clones, and an almighty domain-type effect began to apply to the
area, filling it with Kilostar’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning fought
back with all his power, going so far as to use his Elementum
Waterflame Gourd, he wasn’t able to do anything to this formation
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the thousand
Kilostars, they continuously assaulted Ning. Ning’s two mighty
streaks of Dao lightning blasted out with wild abandon, slowing down
and restricting the actions of the many Kilostars, and Ning struck
out with maximum power each time. Although Kilostar was absolutely
dominating Ning in this battle, Ning’s six Eternal weapons gave him
an utterly airtight defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-arts
aren’t that powerful, but your defenses really are tight.”
Kilostar then merged with the rest of his clones into one body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With his clones merged
together, he now had a body comparable to that of a Daolord of the
First Step. He was now able to use divine abilities as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s
azureflower mist energy enhanced his body, there was no way for him
to use that mist energy to cast divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar wielded a
single scimitar in one hand, and his saber-arts were ephemeral and
unpredictable. He was incredibly strong and incredibly fast, a far
more frightening foe than Sabafalle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords were
trembling with each collision, but fortunately he was able to use his
six swords to defend in succession. He was being completely dominated
in this fight, but every so often Ning would intentionally allow one
of Kilostar’s blows to land upon him, resulting in the power of his
aquaflect armor playing quite a few nasty tricks on his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have an utter
ocean of divine power thanks to the [Thousand Bodies Sutra], but how
is it that YOU are able to keep fighting for so long?” After
fighting for an extended period of time, Kilostar was completely
stunned. “Screw this, I’m done! This is just an utter waste of my
divine power. My name is Kilostar. What is your name? You are indeed
strong enough to reside amongst us within the fifth stratum. If
nothing else, you can use your divine power to keep fighting until
you exhaust and defeat some of the others on our stratum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name as
Darknorth.” Ning smiled as well. On this day, he became friends
with Kilostar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, in the end Ning
acknowledged defeat in this battle. Thus, he once more fell, this
time from the fourth stratum to the third stratum.

Chapter 39 - Life in the Astral Islands
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A year later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were now fifteen
astral islands within the fifth stratum, all slowly circling each
other. Ji Ning sat within one of the astral islands, seated atop a
wooden seat and slowly sipping a cup of wine as he read through the
golden book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the other astral
islands in the fifth stratum suddenly began to drop down towards the
fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a mess.” Ning
couldn’t help but sigh softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. During the past
year since he had been the first in his group of cultivators to make
it to the fifth stratum, others such as Gorho, the Empress, and the
Waterstrider had all made it to the fifth stratum as well. This made
the fifth stratum much more lively than it had been in the past.
Previously, all twelve of the cultivators on the fifth stratum knew
each other quite well, resulting in very few challenges amongst them.
Most of them would engage in training, only choosing to issue
challenges once they felt as though they had made some new
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the sudden addition
of so many new geniuses had caused a huge disturbance. The twelve
original denizens of the fifth stratum were all intrigued and
excited, beginning to issue challenges to the newcomers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One battle after
another had begun to play out. With each battle, a fifth stratum
expert would lose and fall down to the fourth stratum. However, that
person would quickly be able to ascend to the fifth stratum once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fall down, rise up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fall down, rise up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every few days, an
astral island would fall down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stratum
always had at least nine astral islands within it. At most, it had a
total of sixteen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to all
these other freaks and geniuses, I really am just an ordinary
figure.” Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling many
times against the others, Ning realized that the vast majority of the
people within the fifth stratum were special lifeforms! Only a small
number of them were cultivators! Everyone had his or her own
specialty, and only Kilostar could be said to have almost no
weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar had a total of
a thousand clones!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw combat
power, most likely only Ji Ning was a match for him. Once he used his
thousand bodies to form that great formation, there was no one
capable of injuring him at all. In terms of raw power, once his
thousand bodies merged into one… he truly stood at the very top.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Kilostar
had never fallen from his position within the fifth stratum! As for
the newcomer named Waterwalker, he was a special lifeform that
similarly did not fall from the fifth stratum after reaching it. Ning
had battled against him before as well. Waterwalker had a look of
innocence in his eyes, almost as though he was a newborn child. He
just stood there and allowed Ning to attack him as he pleased.
Waterwalker himself simply transformed into an enormous globe of
water, and none of Ning’s attacks could harm him whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This virtually
invincible defensive technique, all by itself, was enough to let
Waterwalker find stable footing here on the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kilostar relies on
his thousand clones and that formation, making it impossible for
anyone to harm him. As for Waterwalker, he can transform into an
enormous water drop that is equally impervious to harm. Still…
Waterwalker seems to be a completely guileless man. I wonder if he
really is that innocent or if it is all a façade.” Ning was
puzzled by this as well. Although they had only met a single time,
the man had given Ning a good impression. The problem was that his
innocence seemed excessive to the point of artifice. Before the duel
between the two of them had started, he had repeatedly asked Ning all
sorts of random questions. It was as though he was curious about
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their ‘fight’
simply consisted of Ning attacking him and him not fighting back at
all. No matter how hard Ning hit him, it was useless… and as Ning
hit him, he actually continued to engage Ning in energetic
conversation, continuing to ask Ning all sorts of random questions.
In the end, Ning had to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My body isn’t any
whit weaker than the bodies of those special lifeforms. My only
weakness lies in my sword-arts. If only I had mastered the sixth
stance of the [Nameless] sword-art! If I could do that, I would be
able to easily deal with any of these other freaks on the fifth
stratum.” Ning pondered on this matter. If he could master the
sixth stance, his sword-arts would become comparable to Kilostar’s
saber-arts. This was the same level which Arroyo’s saber-arts had
been on, and also the same level which the trials of the three
Mirrorsnow Paintings were on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art represented a specific level of attainment. At
this level, a master-class World God could use a mere Dao weapon to
unleash the power of a supreme World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With this sword-art and
the Elementum Waterflame Gourd… Ning would be able to fight
Kilostar to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two more months went
by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally managed to
acquire a full sword-art legacy, but it was the legacy ranked
seventy-third. Ning had been planning to wait a few days then gift
this legacy to World God Pillsaint, who he was quite fond of, but he
didn’t expect that during this period of time he was once more
accosted by Waterwalker. Ning was unable to do any damage to him
whatsoever, and the man absolutely refused to admit defeat, instead
continuing to engage Ning in conversation. In the end, it was Ning
who once more was formed to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterwalker had a bad
habit. After he won a challenge, he would insist on taking away all
of his opponent’s legacy treasures. As he put it, “I really like
these legacies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing Ning
could do…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could only sigh
quietly to himself. World God Pillsaint, you’ve been here for quite
some time already. Just wait patiently for a bit longer. When I find
the chance, I’ll give you another set of legacy treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five more months passed
before Ning was able to acquire another set of sword-arts legacy
treasures. This set was the one ranked number nineteen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a vast place
with a towering mountain at the center of it. At the tallest peak on
this mountain there was a white-robed youth who was seated in the
lotus position, staring at the wide world beyond the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
mastered this stance, the ‘Silent World’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this vantage point
at the top of the mountain, his gaze was able to see to the very
edges of this estate-world. Ning felt as though this entire world was
under his control. In addition, he had benefited from his acquisition
of those two mighty sword-arts legacies. As a result, Ning finally
mastered the fifth stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the ‘Silent
World’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve only mastered
five stances. That is nothing.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endless
Territories, this was already an incredible achievement. World God
Northrest himself had merely reached this level of sword-arts.
However, Ning was now comparing himself to the terrifyingly talented
geniuses which the Hegemon of the Brightshore Kingdom had selected
from throughout the many territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To reach the sixth
stance is no easy feat. Even after gaining those two legacies…
it’ll take me tens of thousands of years at the very least, or
perhaps as much as a few hundred thousand years.” Ning shook his
head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo had made his
breakthrough during the battle atop the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance would
allow Ning to just barely fulfill the criteria necessary for
overcoming Eternal Emperor Mirrorsnow’s trials. To reach this level
truly would be very difficult. Ning was living in the Astral Islands,
had a large group of fellow geniuses to test himself against, and two
mighty sword-arts legacies. This was why he might be able to succeed
in ‘just’ a few hundred thousand years at most. This seemed like
a long period of time, but Ning had the temporal acceleration
treasure known as the Luminous Room. A thousand years in the real
world might be enough to allow him to master this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for these two
sword-arts legacies?” Ning waved his hand, causing a thick tome to
appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This tome was six
hundred pages long. Each of its pages was a legacy treasure. Ning had
to acquire all six hundred pages before being able to merge them all
into this book and acquiring the sword-arts legacy within it. This
was the legacy that was ranked nineteenth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped the book
open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single page had a
single character on it that was filled with the aura of the Dao of
the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had memorized this
legacy long ago. As for the six hundred characters, they represented
six hundred different types of sword-intents that allowed Ning to get
a better understanding of this sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Shipstream truly loved calligraphy. I love calligraphy as well.
That’s something we have in common.” After acquiring this legacy,
Ning had also gained some information regarding Daolord Shipstream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shipstream was
an ancient power who had reached the Verge of the Daomerge. In the
end, he had failed his Daomerge. He had perished and his Dao
dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He liked to wander
about and disliked combat. He titled himself Shipstream because he
liked to voyage through the Endless Territories. Due to his
personality, his sword-arts didn’t focus on offense; instead, they
were incredibly defensive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had left behind an
extremely detailed and complete legacy, as well as those six hundred
characters. Each legacy represented a specific sword-intent. Ning
himself was fond of using calligraphy to symbolize his sword-intent,
and so he was easily able to understand the information and insights
which Daolord Shipstream had sought to transmit through these
characters. Given that Ning’s sword-arts were quite defensively
oriented to begin with, he was indeed able to quickly understand the
true essence of the sword-arts of Daolord Shipstream. A short month
after gaining this legacy, Ning had mastered the fifth stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two sword-arts
legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was ranked
seventy-three. It seemed dazzling but it actually had clear
weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was ranked
nineteen. It had been created by Daolord Shipstream. It seemed
ordinary and unremarkable, but it was actually filled with boundless
wisdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Afterwards, Ning
continued to focus on analyzing his sword-arts. Even though Kilostar
once more issued Ning a challenge, Ning made his position quite
clear. “I can admit defeat, but I absolutely cannot give you this
sword-art legacy. If you don’t accept my terms, then I won’t
admit defeat and we can just keep up this battle of attrition. In all
honesty, most likely the only person capable of defeating Ning in a
battle of attrition was Kilostar. But of course, that was if Ning
didn’t use any of his chaos jewels. When Ning had left the Badlands
Territory, he had converted quite a bit of his chaos nectar into
chaos jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the other
cultivators could possibly beat Ning in a battle of attrition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar walked the
path of the Dao of the Saber. He really didn’t care about
sword-arts at all and so he didn’t mind Ning’s terms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterwalker… Ning
wasn’t able to do anything to him, but he wasn’t able to do
anything to Ning either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the book which
had been personally authored by Daolord Shipstream remained by Ning’s
side. Each day, Ning would spend much of his time silently meditating
on this book, and his sword-arts continued to rise in profundity,
especially in defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was so absorbed in
his sword-arts that he very nearly forgot all about World God
Pillsaint. As far as Ning was considered, if he could help out he
would, but that was a favor and not an obligation. World God
Pillsaint had been here for countless years anyhow. To be here for
another ten thousand years or hundred thousand years wouldn’t be
that big a deal to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed out. In the
blink of an eye, more than five hundred years had gone by in
meditation and battle.

Chapter 40 - [Nameless] Sword-Art, Stance Six - Unicorn’s Heart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the estate-world
of the first Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a towering
palace here that was absolutely beautiful. A figure slowly
materialized atop the royal throne at the front of the hall. It was
the golden-robed emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve come
again.” The golden-robed emperor stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded from his
position below the throne. “Be careful this time. If you are
overconfident, you might end up being defeated by me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the first
time I’ve heard you say such a thing.” The golden-robed emperor’s
eyes lit up as he produced that wide golden greatsword. He rose to
his feet and began to walk down the stairs from his throne. “Come,
come! Don’t disappoint me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning produced one of
his Frostice Swords as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
without moving. As for the golden-robed emperor, he slowly walked
down the steps. Although the two had yet to engage, their auras were
beginning to surge and press against each other. Both were carefully
inspecting their foe. Although the golden-robed emperor had won every
match, he himself was aware that Ning was posing an increasingly
great threat to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s off.”
The golden-robed emperor suddenly sensed something strange. Although
Ning stood a distance away from him, he gave the emperor a sensation
of unpredictable fluctuation. This was something he had never sensed
before in his previous battles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget him. I’ll
smash it all to smithereens.” The golden-robed emperor’s path was
a Dao of righteous valor and honor. He raised his golden greatsword
up high, then sent it crashing downwards towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A terrifying aura
of power blasted out as the greatsword chopped down furiously towards
Ning, seeming to carry such great power that it could hack any foe to
death. This terrifying aura alone was enough to freeze the hearts of
many World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sniiiiick. Ning’s
frozen sword flashed out like a streak of azure mist as it scraped
upwards towards the golden greatsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was just
using the flat of his blade to push at and scrape at the sword, this
actually made things harder for the golden-robed emperor than a
frontal clash would have! The strange power held within Ning’s
sword caused the emperor’s golden greatsword to change directions,
causing it to completely miss Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you couldn’t hit
your opponent, it didn’t matter how powerful your sword-arts were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So his technique
really has changed.” The golden-robed emperor was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Nameless]
sword-art truly is marvelous.” Ning was overjoyed. Although he had
just learned this sixth stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, he hadn’t
actually employed it yet. This battle against the golden-robed
emperor was his first time actually using it in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This clash had resulted
in him easily defeating the valiant, killing blow of the emperor.
Although Ning had been able to withstand this strike in the past, it
had always been incredibly taxing for him. In fact, he would stumble
backwards after each block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, he didn’t
have to use too much strength. He was able to effortlessly use a
single strike to block this attack without even having to face it
head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” The
golden-robed emperor let out an angry roar. Suddenly, a golden streak
of crescent sword-light appeared high in the air of the palace, then
chopped down horizontally towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Once again, Ning
unleashed that seemingly casual strike in response. He sent his sword
scraping against the edge of that golden crescent. As their weapons
collided, the power of each person’s sword-arts began to clash
against each other. The golden-robed emperor’s sword-art were more
dominating whereas Ning’s sword-art was more ephemeral and
unpredictable. However, for some reason Ning was able to change the
direction of the emperor’s sword yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden greatsword
had been sweeping directly towards Ning, but as Ning sent his own
sword scraping and pushing down upon the greatsword, the sword-light
ended up slashing into the ground in front of Ning’s feet. It
completely missed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?
This is impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
emperor was angry now. He launched one attack after another, and each
sword was filled with truly valiant and dominating power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each strike of Ning’s
seemed to be very casual and relaxed, but in truth he had focused all
of his concentration into each strike. He had unleashed his
sword-arts to maximum effect, and during this battle he began to gain
a better and better understanding of the application of this sixth
stance of the [Nameless] sword-art. He began to better understand how
to actually use it in battle, and as this battle proceeded Ning began
to relax.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick! Snick! Clank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light clashed
over and over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very strange.
Generally speaking, when two experts battled their weapons would
produce sonorous explosions, as though the heavens were about to
collapse. However, whenever Ning’s sword collided with his
opponent’s sword, it merely produced a very gentle sound. It was as
though Ning was using a brush to write words on parchment. He seemed
quite relaxed and at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s fluctuating
sword-light once more scraped against the golden sword-light. This
time, it scraped straight past it and stabbed straight into the
golden-robed emperor’s throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword went straight
through the emperor’s throat. Everything went still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
emperor came to a halt, and Ning withdrew his Frostice Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve won.” The
golden-robed emperor had a strange smile on his face. “Your
sword-arts have been improving for years now. I knew that sooner or
later, you would be able to defeat me. Still, even I didn’t expect
that it would happen this quickly. Can you tell me what your
sword-art is named?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a sword-art
created by a major power. This the sixth stance, and its name is the
‘Unicorn’s Heart’,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Unicorn’s
Heart?” The golden-robed emperor nodded slowly. “Your sword truly
is ephemeral and unpredictable. It makes things quite uncomfortable
for your foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, your
sword-art is honorable, direct, and dominating. I had to fight for
very long before I was able to win through one fortunate strike,”
Ning said. In truth, when he had first started fighting he hadn’t
been very familiar with the Unicorn’s Heart. Naturally, it was very
hard for him to win. However, as he slowly began to grow increasingly
familiar with this technique, he had improved to the point of being
able to stab through the emperor’s throat with one blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nameless]
sword-art was very interesting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stance was
the Heartsword stance. It required the wielder possess absolute
control over his his sword, allowing his heart to be in control of
the sword and the world around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stance was
the Killsword stance. It was an utterly dominating and powerful
stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stance was
the Great Firmament stance. It allowed the user to create a world
unto itself. In truth, this was the upgrade version of the Heartsword
stance. It perfected the technique, giving it even more perfect
defensive powers and making its attacks even tighter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stance was
the Horizon’s Edge stance. It could be described with one word -
fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stance was
the Silent World stance. It could be described with one word -
savage! The fourth stance and fifth stance were both attacking
stances that were meant to be used against different types of foes.
Some foes could only be dispatched with speed, others required
dominating and savage sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance was
the Unicorn’s Heart stance. This represented an evolutionary
transformation of the Great Firmament stance. It was much brighter
than the Heartsword stance; the Heartsword stance only gave absolute
control over the sword, whereas the Unicorn’s Heart was able to
produce all sorts of marvelous effects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could easily block,
deflect, and redirect attacks. It could also kill foes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-art was
ephemeral, unpredictable, and incredibly abstruse. It was extremely
hard to comprehend. Fortunately, Daolord Shipstream’s legacy and
the book he had left behind were highly focused on defense. Once a
defensive technique reached the later stages, it would also gain
something akin to the flavor of the Unicorn’s Heart. After all,
truly powerful sword-arts all had things in common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, after five
hundred years Ning was able to master this sixth stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stance,
Heartsword stance. The third stance, Great Firmament stance. The
sixth stance, the Unicorn’s Heart stance. All of them are highly
defensive techniques that can also be used to slay my foes.” Ning
knew quite clearly that these three stances were fundamentally the
same. All of them focused on tightly controlled sword-arts that
sought out flaws to use for sure-fire kills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Killsword stance,
Horizon’s Edge stance, and Silent World stance were stances that
were completely focused on attacking while holding nothing back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have defeated me
and passed my trial. However, you must defeat the other three as
well,” the golden-robed emperor said. “Only then shall you gain
the legacy of the Eternal Emperor and become his personal disciple!
Emperor Mirrorsnow’s sword-arts were some of the most terrifying
sword-arts of all the Endless Territories. If you become his
disciple, your future prospects shall be limitless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning currently had a
total of three Mirrorsnow Paintings. The first held the golden-robed
emperor, the second held the assassin, and the third held the
fisherman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The assassin’s sword
was a bizarre sword that was focused on murder and death. In a world
of darkness, the assassin would suddenly appear and disappear out of
nowhere, his sword-light flashing as he stabbed at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would be forced to
stand there, Frostice Sword in hand, blocking each and every strike
from the assassin. The assassin’s sword-arts were on the exact same
level as the golden-robed emperor’r sword-arts, but they had
completely different styles. They provided different insights to
Ning, allowing Ning to gain many new insights into the Unicorn’s
Heart. At first, he still found himself unaccustomed to dealing with
the assassin’s fighting style. However, he slowly became accustomed
to it and found it increasingly easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed as
it stabbed straight through the assassin’s throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The assassin was
incredibly slender. His face was covered with scales, and his eyes
glowed with green light. This was the first time Ning had caught a
clear glimpse of the assassin’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won. Defeat the
other three and you shall receive the Eternal Emperor’s legacy.”
The assassin spoke in a hoarse voice, then disappeared once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate-world within
the third painting. This was the world of the fisherman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two clashed for
quite some time. The fisherman no longer seemed as relaxed and
carefree as he had been in previous battles. This time, he fought
with full intensity and deadly seriousness. Ning’s expressions were
similarly solemn, and the two battled for more than two hours. This
high-intensity battle gradually began to wear both of them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Ning’s battles against the other two had lasted for less than
one hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fisherman’s
sword is unpredictable and fluctuating, and he uses that fishing pole
of his to fight me. That pole is sometimes rigid but sometimes
flexible, whereas my sword is incredibly sharp and resilient… and
yet, I’m still unable to breach his defenses.” Ning was beginning
to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fisherman’s sword
was quite similar to his own Unicorn’s Heart. Both were
unpredictable, fluctuating sword-arts that sought out a chance to
deliver a single lethal strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, the
fisherman’s sword had a ‘softer’ defense, but once he reached
an opponent who was a match for him the fisherman unleashed virtually
all of the potential within his sword-arts, resulting in Ning being
completely unable to harm him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the two came
to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-art is
incredibly profound and mysterious. It truly is one of the most
profound sword-arts of all the Endless Territories. However, my own
sword-arts were passed down by the Eternal Emperor himself. If you
wish to defeat me, you’ll need to improve a little bit more.” The
fisherman calmly walked back to his pool and began to fish again.
“You can leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t
disappointed. Instead, his heart was filled with joy. This battle
with the fisherman had resulted in him improving dramatically in his
Unicorn’s Heart.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After mastering the
sixth stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, ‘Unicorn’s Heart’, Ji
Ning spent another year before he was able to develop the third
stance of his [Quintessence Sword-Intent], the ‘Astral’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackmist stance,
Allgod stance, Astral stance. These three stances were named after
three places or people that had a huge effect on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Heart
and the Astral stance were sword-arts on the same general level of
power. However, when Ning used Violetjewel to executed the Astral
stance he was able to unleash several times more power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his sword-arts
improved, Ning became capable of standing firmly within the fifth
stratum. Even Kilostar was merely on par with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when Kilostar
used his full power he was clearly on a higher level of power than
Ning. Unfortunately, Ning had the Elementum Waterflame Gourd and six
sets of Violetjewel. It was hard for the other geniuses to compete
against him in terms of wealth and treasures.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have six damn
swords, whereas I just have a pair of warblades… and you, you sly
bastard, keep on releasing lightning to attack me as well!”
Kilostar was frustrated by his battles against Ning as well. He had
to go all-out in each fight, but he was still only able to fight to a
standstill. “Screw this, I’m done! I’m not going to accept any
more challenges from you. Go ahead and admit defeat! I’d rather die
than admit defeat in this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar immediately
transformed into a thousand clones again and entered his formation.
He absolutely refused to admit defeat, and this great formation
ensured that there really was no way anyone could do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in quite a
good mood, and so he voluntarily admitted defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-two years after
learning the Unicorn’s Heart, Ning finally managed to piece
together the footwork legacy he wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally have it.”
Ning stared at the jade tome in his hands. The footwork legacy
consisted of a series of jade slips, and there were a total of eight
hundred slips. After acquiring all eight hundred, they came together
to form a jade tome that radiated several large characters: “Swear
the oath and you can view my true teachings.” There were a few
other smaller characters hovering nearby those larger characters as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reviewed the
restrictive spells pertaining to the jade tome, then immediately
swore the oath. A large amount of information then began to transmit
into Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, a series
of tightly clustered characters began to emanate out of the jade
tome, bringing with them an aura of marvelous and profundity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Footwork technique.
What does this phrase means? It simply refers to a technique meant
for movement! Unless there is a tremendous gap in power, a powerful
footwork technique is far more effective than offensive or defensive
techniques. This is true for both mortals as well as Eternal
Emperors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I am always a
step ahead of you, your sword shall never touch me. Even if I can
only dodge it by one centimeter, I’ll have rendered your sword-arts
useless against me, no matter how powerful they are.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my footwork
techniques are powerful, I’ll be able to strike my foes without him
being able to strike me. All shall be under my control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read these words,
then slowly nodded. He understood the importance of a good footwork
technique. When he was young and living in Swallow Mountain, his
mother Yuchi Snow had personally taught him his first footwork
techniques. Ning had never abandoned his progression in this area,
and had always infused his insights into the Dao into his footwork
techniques. He had even purchased a pair of Thunderlight Wings! His
footwork abilities were actually quite excellent compared to his
World-level peers. He actually wasn’t lacking in this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All good footwork
techniques share certain commonalities. They allow you to instantly
explode with speed, allowing you to dodge attacks as best you can.
Two people might have the same level of divine power and the same
insights into the Dao, but the one who has superior footwork
techniques will be able to dodge faster. A good footwork technique
can make a tremendous difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This footwork
technique of mine involves the cycling of divine power that can be
divided up into three layers of expertise. The first level is most
likely comparable to that of the footwork techniques most cultivators
use, allowing them to dodge and move at high speed. The second allows
for nearly instantaneous dodging that is at a far faster level. As
for the third level…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning read on, he
couldn’t help but laugh awkwardly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cycling of divine
power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His greatest source of
power came from his azureflower mist energy. No matter how strong his
divine power became, it couldn’t possibly compare to that mist
energy! Although this technique’s unique methods of cycling divine
power had been transmitted into Ning’s mind, it truly was of no use
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning read on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power you can
unleash from your footwork depends on two things. The first is the
way in which you cycle your divine power. The second is the skill
with which you execute the techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who have a
high level of skill are able to easily surpass those at a lower level
of skill, even if they don’t use any divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My footwork
technique has a special history to it. Long ago, when I was paying my
respects to the almighty Hegemon of the Brightshore Kingdom, I saw a
lightning dragon. This lightning dragon was actually a streak of
lightning which the almighty Hegemon had created that was capable of
gaining eternity. When I saw how this ‘Eternal Thunderdragon’
moved about, I meditated for many years before coming up with this
technique, the Thunderdragon footwork technique. It can be divided up
into five different levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first level is
the level known as ‘control’. Anyone who studies this footwork
technique of mine can master this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second level is
the level known as ‘infusion’. You shall infuse all of your
insights into the Dao into this footwork technique. If you are
skilled in the Dao of Spacetime, you should infuse those insights
into your footwork. If you are skilled in the Dao of the Saber, then
you can do the same. Only once you truly and completely merge your
deepest insights into the Dao into my Thunderdragon footwork
technique shall you have mastered my ‘infusion’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level is
the level known as ‘draconify’. When you use this footwork
technique, an illusion of a lightning dragon shall protect your body,
allowing your speed to increase dramatically. At this level, you
shall have begin to grasp the true essence of this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth level is
the level known as ‘thunderdragon’. This footwork technique can
be used to control a type of lightning which is on the same level as
other types of Dao lightning. Once you reach the fourth level, the
lightning you control can become one with your body. You shall be the
lightning and the lightning shall be you. You’ll be able to move as
fast as Dao lightning. Even I myself have only ever reached this
fourth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth level is
the level known as the ‘Eternal Thunderdragon’. After I created
this technique, the almighty Hegemon looked it over and added a few
improvements to two parts of it, then informed me that once this
technique reached the apex one would be able to manifest a streak of
Eternal lightning, then become one with it. I have spent dozens of
chaos cycles painstakingly meditating on this technique as a
Verge-level Daolord, but I’m still unable to make any improvements.
I can’t even imagine what sort of level this ‘apex’ which the
almighty Hegemon spoke of is at, but I’ve taken the liberty of
describing it as the fifth level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement as he read this. This footwork technique was
far too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rest of the jade
tome just included a few diagrams. There were a total of eighteen
images of thunder dragons. As for the detailed information regarding
the footwork technique as well as the divine power cycling method,
all of that had been directly transmitted into Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine power
cycling method is useless to me, but this footwork technique itself
is incredibly powerful once one reaches the apex of it.” Ning knew
exactly what the phrase Eternal lightning entailed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos lightning
belonged to the World level of power, which was why it could easily
breach the limits of the Heavenly Daos. Chaos lightning flew
incredibly fast, roughly ten times faster than the speed of light.
Generally speaking, even most Daolords were unable to move that fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao lightning belonged
to the Samsara level of power. Some Dao lightning was born from the
endless primordial chaos, but some had been created by Daolords! In
the Three Realms, Zhurong had created his own Zhurong Godfire while
Suiren had created his Eternal Kindlefire. Samsara Daolords were
similarly capable of creating their own incredibly powerful types of
Dao lightning. Dao lightning flew incredibly fast, far faster than
Chaos lightning. Generally speaking, they were able to move a hundred
times faster than the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Eternal
lightning… this level of lightning was something out of the
legends. Ning had never heard of any type of Eternal lightning
emerging naturally from the primordial chaos. Perhaps it existed,
perhaps it did not. Only Eternal Emperors could hope to create
Eternal lightning, and that only if they had reached incredibly
profound levels of insight into the Dao of Lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for how fast Eternal
lightning moved? Ning had no idea as he had never seen it before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When one reaches the
apex of this footwork technique, one will be able to manifest a type
of Eternal lightning, then merge with it?” Ning was speechless. How
fast would such a person become?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, even the
creator of this footwork technique was only able to reach the fourth
level. This, despite the fact that he was so talented that he was
able to develop it after merely seeing the Hegemon’s own Eternal
lightning. Most likely, the only reason why this footwork has a
so-called ‘fifth level’ is because of the two alterations which
the almighty Hegemon made to it.” Ning instantly realized that the
fifth level was most likely something illusory and untouchable, like
the reflection of the moon in the waters of a lake. If even a
Verge-level Daolord spent dozens of chaos cycles without being able
to master it, who could?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My ambitions aren’t
that high. I’ll be happy just reaching the third level.” Ning was
still feeling quite excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the third level, he
would gain the protection of an illusory thunder dragon that would
allow him to move with incredible speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life for Ning in the
Astral Islands was quite blissful. He had memorized two valuable
sword-art legacies that he could train in, which included very
detailed instructions on their use. He had also memorized an
incredibly powerful footwork technique, one that was far superior to
any other technique which Ning had ever seen. This, too, was
available for Ning to train in as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for experts on his
same general level? There were dozens of freakishly talented geniuses
for him to duel against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on, one day
after another. The battles between the fifth stratum cultivators
became rarer and rarer, as by now everyone had already fought
everyone else. Some of them had battled each person multiple times by
now. Even Kilostar and Waterwalker had dueled each other. But of
course, the end result was that Waterwalker had been defeated.
Kilostar maintained his undefeated streak within the fifth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, and in
the blink of an eye Ning had spent a thousand years here at the
Astral Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stratum still
had just a single astral island hovering within it. This was the
residence of Bertulu, and he had issued no challenges. No one was
qualified to truly challenge him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this astral
island there was a white-haired youth dressed in loose white robes
who was seated in the lotus position on the ground. Suddenly, his
eyes opened up. He had a gentle, warm gaze, but they seemed to hold
the light of countless stars within them. He murmured softly to
himself, “A thousand years have gone past. The new cultivators have
experienced a thousand years of tempering and growth. I imagine they
should have reached a bottleneck in power by now. It is time for me
to challenge them a bit. Mm… I shall start with Kilostar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, something
happened that stunned all of the cultivators of the hundreds of
thousands of astral islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar, who had never
fallen from the fifth stratum after entering it, had actually fallen
down to the fourth stratum. All of his legacy treasures had been
seized by the sixth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone knew that the
sixth stratum cultivator, Bertulu, had just struck out and defeated
Kilostar!
</P>

Chapter 42 - Predeparture Preparations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up! Bring out
all your best wine.” Kilostar and Bertulu were seated facing to
each other on an oceanic island, a stone table in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On one side was the
skinny and swarthy Kilostar, dressed in that silver cape of his. On
the other side was a white-robed, white-haired youth. The two had
completely different looks and auras as well. Kilostar’s aura was
rather valiant and explosive, whereas Bertulu’s aura was much
warmer and more radiant. He was like the warmth of the sun, bringing
comfort and friendliness to all who saw him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more like
it.” Kilostar grabbed the gourd of wine that had appeared on the
stone table, lifted it up high, then began to guzzle it all down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, alright.
There’s no need for you to be this angry, Kilostar.” Bertulu let
out a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You insidious, sly,
hypocritical wolf in cultivator’s clothing!” Kilostar glared
ferociously at Bertulu. Even his third eye within his forehead was
bulging with rage. “I have NEVER fallen down from the fifth
stratum. It was all because of you! You deceitful bastard, I lost
because of your tricks! That was bullshit! Bullshit! BULLSHIT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu chortled. “You
lost, alright? Even if I did pull a few tricks, the end result was
that you lost. In battle, the only thing that matters is the result.
The process isn’t really important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trusted you!
That’s the only reason you were able to trick me!” Kilostar was
furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this wasn’t
his first time being defeated by Bertulu. In the past, he had won ten
battles in a row and was qualified to charge Bertulu for residence
within the sixth stratum. However, Bertulu had swiftly dispatched him
and sent him right back down to the fifth stratum. Over the course of
many years, the twelve in the fifth stratum had tried numerous times
to make it into the sixth stratum, but each time they were quickly
knocked down by Bertulu once more. The only person who could stably
reside within the sixth stratum was Bertulu himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had used my
formation and focused completely on defense, there’s no way you
could’ve beaten me,” Kilostar said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was pissed off just
thinking about it. He had never been knocked out of the fifth stratum
before. He had wanted to keep his perfect record, leaving behind the
legend of Kilostar once he departed from these Astral Islands. To be
honest, Kilostar had been planning on leaving for some time now…
but who would’ve thought that his golden record would be broken
just before his departure? Now, he was back in the fourth stratum. Of
course he was irritated by this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trusted you! I
considered you my friend! But you-” Kilostar truly was quite
disgruntled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, enough
already. It was my bad, alright? But you know, everything is fair
game in a battle.” Bertulu chortled again. “Oh, right. How strong
are the newbies?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The newbies have
improved significantly. Six of them made it to the fifth stratum,”
Kilostar said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very first year
after Ning’s arrival, four members of his ‘class’ had made it
into the fifth stratum. After a thousand years, two more had joined
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As far as how strong
they are…” Kilostar paused, weighing his words. “In terms of
attack power, the Empress and Darknorth are on par with me. The
others including Gorho, Daoist Fish, Fairy Brightheart, and
Waterwalker are slightly weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Bertulu was
quite intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
defensive prowess, Waterwalker is the strongest freak of all. He
probably has some sort of special innate ability that makes him
virtually unkillable. Next would be Fairy Brightheart, with Darknorth
being third. The Empress, Gorho, and Daoist Fish are ranked below
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar continued, “As
for endurance, Darknorth is the strongest. After him is Fairy
Brightheart, Waterwalker, the Empress, then the rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar nodded. “That
would be how I would rank them. They each have their own
specialties.” Kilostar smiled. “As for the more detailed
information… go try them out yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu was intrigued.
“From what you are saying, it sounds as though this Darknorth
fellow is quite strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? He’s just as
much of a bastard as you are.” Kilostar said in a disgruntled
manner, “At first, his sword-arts were fairly weak and I was able
to crush him with just one warblade. Over the course of the past
thousand years, his footwork techniques and his sword-arts both
improved dramatically. But the disgusting thing is, he not only has
an Elementum Waterflame Gourd, he also has six damn Eternal weapons
that are absolutely identical to each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar shook his
head. “You tell me, doesn’t that just piss you off? Although I,
Kilostar, have acquired multiple Eternal weapons as well, the only
ones that suit me are those two warblades. He actually has SIX of
those Eternal swords, and they are absolutely identical!” Kilostar
said furiously, “It’s like a six on two fight! And that Elementum
Waterflame Gourd continuously releases lightning against me as well…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu was surprised.
“It sounds as though this Darknorth has quite a few treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has a ridiculous
amount of treasures! It’s damn near impossible to get six identical
Eternal weapons, and that Elementum Waterflame Gourd has to be worth
at least half a million cubes of chaos nectar as well. All combined,
that stuff has to be worth more than a million cubes!” Kilostar
grumbled unhappily, “If all he had was two swords and if he didn’t
have that lightning helping him, I’d still be able to crush him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Bertulu
nodded upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have an idea of what
you are going to do?” Kilostar looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few ideas.”
Bertulu nodded. “I wanted to first challenge all of the old timers,
then sweep through the six newbies. After that, I’ll be leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to be
leaving the Astral Islands?” Kilostar was briefly stunned, but he
then nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time. The
reason why I’ve been staying for the past few years was because I
wanted to wait for this newest batch of ‘recruits’ to have a
chance to grow up,” Bertulu explained. “The almighty Hegemon
generally only goes out to personally abduct people roughly once
every chaos cycle. I certainly can’t afford to wait that long for
the next crop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You bastard, you can
break through to become a Daolord whenever you want.” Kilostar
shook his head and sighed. “I, unfortunately, have only gained a
vague glimpse of what my path is to be. I haven’t truly understand
it yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by truly
discovering one’s own path and discovering one’s own Dao would
one be able to rely on that Dao to become a Samsara Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu had discovered
his path and his Dao long ago. He was able to become a Samsara
Daolord whenever he wished it. However, Brightshore Kingdom was a
very safe place and he was simply in no rush to make his
breakthrough. Once he made that choice, there would be no going back.
He naturally wanted to make sure everything was perfect first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You will benefit
greatly from your time in the Twelve Palaces,” Bertulu said.
“Although the Astral Islands have ninety-nine legacies, only the
top ten legacies can be considered decent. Strictly speaking, none of
these legacies can be considered ‘core’ legacies of the Twelve
Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Kilostar
understood this point as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar lost his
battle. His astral island sank from the fifth stratum to the fourth
stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, Bertulu
began an absolute ‘massacre’. He challenged one fifth stratum
expert after another, but none of the challenged experts were afraid
of him. Bertulu was a person who they normally wouldn’t have a
chance to fight. All of them were filled with a towering desire to do
battle as they went forth to face Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the end result was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single astral
island was smacked down to the fourth stratum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, the fifth
stratum had sixteen islands. It shrank down to fifteen… fourteen…
thirteen… twelve…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more islands
began to fall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another island
has fallen.” Ning stood at the edges of his own astral island,
staring off into the distance as another astral island that had been
within his stratum began to sink downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. My sword-arts
have reached a bottleneck, as have my footwork techniques. It’ll be
difficult for me to improve any further here in the Astral Islands.
Although there are many freaks here for me to fight against, it is
still time to leave soon,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was time to leave
the Astral Islands. Yes, the environment here was nice, and it was
possible that over the course of countless years sparring against
these monsters he might gain some insights that would allow him to
master the seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That would almost
assuredly be something that happened a very, very long time from now.
It had taken him nearly five hundred years to master the sixth
stance, and if you factored in the temporal acceleration it had
actually taken tens of thousands of years. As for the seventh stance,
Ning was completely mystified by it. He knew that mastering it would
be an incredibly difficult prospect, and it would most likely take
him perhaps a thousand times more time and effort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m under the
effects of a lifeblood oath to reach Vastheaven Palace within a chaos
cycle. Only then will I be able to return to the Three Realms to
bring back my parents. Although a chaos cycle is an extremely long
period of time, who knows what new variables might be introduced in
the future? I can’t waste too much time here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded to himself.
To have spent a thousand years here in the Astral Islands was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should give this
footwork legacy to World God Pillsaint.” Ning picked up his golden
book, then sent World God Pillsaint a challenge. He was going to
leave and he wouldn’t be able to take this jade tome with him. He
might as well give it to Pillsaint instead. The first person Ning had
met here in the Astral Islands had been Pillsaint, and he had quite a
good impression of the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A challenge?” The
rosy-lipped, white-teethed, chubby-faced youth, World God Pillsaint,
looked at his book. His eyes lit up. “It is Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Pillsaint were
on very good terms with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when Ning
didn’t wish to battle against a particular foe, but that person
insisted on challenging him, Ning would often send World God
Pillsaint a challenge and use that duel to avoid the first one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is Darknorth trying
to avoid another challenge?” Pillsaint was puzzled. Still, he
entered the room filled with divine runes and allowed himself to be
teleported directly to the battlegrounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an icy cold
oceanic island that was completely locked in by icebergs. A cold wind
howled through this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Pillsaint
appeared, he immediately saw the white-robed youth who was carrying
that sword on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,”
Pillsaint immediately called out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint.” Ning
looked at him. “I’m going to be leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leaving?”
Pillsaint was stunned. “So soon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s crazy fast.
We cultivators live extremely long lives. Why rush things like this?
Generally speaking, most of those other freakishly talented geniuses
will spend ten million years or a hundred million years here before
leaving,” Pillsaint said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. If he
stayed here for ten million years, he probably would indeed be able
to master the seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art. Ten million
years out of an entire chaos cycle? That really was nothing. Still,
Ning wanted to save as much time as he could, for fear of something
else from happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for me to
leave. This time, I admit defeat.” Ning spoke out in a high-pitched
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admit… defeat?”
Pillsaint was stunned. Ning had never admitted defeat in any of his
battles before. He knew that that Ning had a footwork legacy in his
hands. Was Ning planning to transfer this legacy to him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be able to
take this footwork legacy away with me. Take it.” Ning tossed the
jade tome over to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint couldn’t
control himself. He immediately extended his arms to accept the jade
tome, gripping it with his fingers. His eyes couldn’t help but turn
red. He had been trapped here in the Astral Islands for an extremely
long period of time. He desperately wanted to find a way to leave,
but acquiring a full legacy truly was not easy. Whenever he had
enough parts of a legacy, he would suffer countless challenges from
cultivators on the third and fourth strata. Each time he got close,
he would lose it all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Pillsaint’s eyes turned red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m embarrassed to
say this, but I was actually planning to give you a sword-art legacy
I acquired quite some time ago. Unfortunately, Waterwalker managed to
force it out of me.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I’m
endlessly grateful that you are willing to help me out. You’ve been
here for less than a thousand years, right? It hasn’t been a long
time at all.” Pillsaint was quite moved. With this legacy, he would
regain his freedom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Once I
leave, I’ll be joining the Palace of the Sword of the Twelve
Palaces,” Ning said. “If you wish to meet me, go to the Sword
Palace and seek me out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will.” World God
Pillsaint nodded vigorously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And now… the only
thing that remains is my battle against Bertulu.” Ning had a
distant look in his eyes. The last thing he wanted to do before
leaving this place was to have a battle against Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu, the undisputed
number one expert of the hundreds of thousands of astral islands.
Ever since he had made it to the sixth stratum, he had never fallen
down from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had battled
against all the other talented geniuses. He had never, however,
battled Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really look
forward to it.” Ning could feel his blood boiling with eagerness
just thinking about this battle.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 43 - The Hegemon
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was looking
forward to battling Bertulu. After fighting with him, he could leave
the Astral Islands with no regrets. However, he had to wait for
Bertulu to finish challenging the old timers first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of astral
islands in the fifth stratum continued to decreased. Eight. Seven.
Six. Five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only five were left!
These were the five newcomers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” The
handsome, devilish-looking silver-haired youth stared at the
white-robed, white-haired youth in the distance. Both had
extraordinary auras. The former had a more devilish aura while the
latter had an aura of warmth and calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gorho, it seems as
though you have already found your own path to becoming a Samsara
Daolord.” Bertulu smiled as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” It was very
rare for Gorho to feel admiration towards someone else. Although
Darknorth and Kilostar had defeated him, he didn’t really care too
much. This was because he could tell that Kilostar had mainly
succeeded due to having a thousand clones, while Darknorth had a body
just as tough as Kilostar’s and most likely had a similar technique
he relied on. In terms of actual insights into the Dao, neither
Darknorth nor Kilostar were up to his level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Bertulu gave
Gorho a sense of tremendous pressure! This was the first time he had
encountered someone who completely outclassed him in terms of
enlightenment and insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What path do you
plan to walk?” Bertulu asked with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I have the
chance, I will walk the path of spacetime,” Gorho said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spacetime? Isn’t
your strongest Dao the Dao of Fire?” Bertulu was puzzled. From the
battle they had just engaged in, he was able to tell that Gorho had
reached incredible heights in the Dao of Fire. In fact, he had
reached the level of being able to use it to become a Samsara Daolord
whenever he wished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I like it, I guess.”
This was Gorho’s response, but in his heart he mused to himself…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My true talent actually
lies in spacetime. My strongest Dao isn’t necessarily my best Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the most
powerful descendant of an almighty Aeonian, King Gorsch. He naturally
was extremely skilled in the Dao of Fire… but he was even more
skilled in spacetime! However, he was personally trained in the
mysteries of fire by King Gorsch, whereas he had to study the art of
spacetime by himself. This was why his Dao of Fire was slightly
superior to his Dao of Spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, by comparison
he had to put twice as much effort into his Dao of Fire, only to get
half the results. Prior to him being abducted, his father King Gorsch
had told Gorho that he was planning to help Gorho find a master who
was skilled in the Dao of Spacetime to teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But how could any
major power possibly be a match for the almighty Hegemon of the
Brightshore Kingdom?” After years of painstaking work, Gorho had
finally managed to acquire a complete spacetime legacy roughly two
years ago. “According to the notes on that legacy, if I reach a
high enough level of skill I will be able to receive personal
guidance from the Hegemon himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I become a
Daolord and Awaken my bloodline, I’ll become even more powerful. By
then, not even Bertulu would necessarily be a match for me.”
Gorho’s heart was filled with tremendous pride and self-confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to their
Awakening, Aeonians were quite similar to cultivators. After being
Awakened, however, they would explode with power and would view other
Samsara Daolords as prey for them to feed out. They truly were
terrifyingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another astral
island descended from the fifth stratum. Now, only four remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My techniques were
completely ineffective against you.” The special lifeform known as
Daoist Fish let out a sigh. His face was covered with fish scales and
his eyes gleamed with golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have too many
techniques. You need to focus a bit more.” Bertulu was gleaming
with light, as dazzling as any sun. Slowly, he began to retract his
aura of radiance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that, but…
I can’t help it. I like them all.” Daoist Fish let out a sigh.
“Ugh. I can play around with any of those individuals on the third
and fourth strata as I please, but each time I fight someone else on
the fifth level I’m beaten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Fish was one of
the last to join the fifth stratum, and he was the only one who was
in the fourth stratum at the time of this challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
This was a bald woman who was dazzlingly beautiful but who had a
demeanor as cold as ice. Right now, a look of absolute shock was on
her face. “How could you have…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Brightheart,
your defensive techniques are indeed quite formidable, and I am
filled with admiration towards you. But that heart of yours… it
really is a major weakness. Any World-level Heartforce Cultivator
would be able to easily defeat you, to say nothing of me.” Bertulu
let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Brightheart’s
face turned slightly pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within her
innermost heart there lay a nightmare that she had never been able to
forget. However, it was also thanks to this nightmare that she had
been able to persevere and reach her current heights in cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Fairy Brightheart nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four islands became
three islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fighting with you
was a wonderful experience. You forced me to go all out.” Bertulu
looked at the jade-haired woman before him. This was the Empress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empress was dressed in
semi-translucent gauze and looked quite bewitching. She let out a
soft laugh. “Bertulu, everyone knows that although you are skilled
in the Dao of Light, you are even more skilled in heartforce. Just
now, you didn’t use your heartforce at all. You were able to defeat
me merely through employing your Dao of Light.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In close combat
abilities, at least, I was forced to use my full power,” Bertulu
said. “Your are extremely talented. However, you are a bit lacking
in terms of your insights into the Dao. If you were to reach a higher
level in this regard, perhaps to Gorho’s level, then I would be
forced to use my heartforce techniques in order to defeat you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three islands
became two islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How incredibly
powerful.” Waterwalker stared at Bertulu, his eyes filled with
shock and awe. “I fell asleep before we even started our fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should’ve been
born just a short while ago, right?” Bertulu looked at Waterwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The almighty
Hegemon captured me just moments after I woke up.” Waterwalker
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your innate
abilities are amongst the most supreme abilities any race of special
lifeforms possess. Most likely, even the Empress is a bit inferior to
you in this regard. Your innate abilities are so strong that I
imagine you are close to being on par with even the legendary Ancient
cultivators or the Brightshore Imperials.” Bertulu continued, “By
relying on your innate abilities, you can ensure that the other
geniuses here are completely unable to injure you. That alone ensures
that you can defeat cultivators on the fourth and fifth strata.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… the
problem with you is that you simply haven’t been alive for long
enough. Spend some extra time here in the Astral Islands. I recommend
you spend a chaos cycle here, then spend another chaos cycle
wandering the Brightshore Kingdom,” Bertulu said. “Only then
should you join the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I don’t
really understand why I have to stay here that long, I can sense that
you have nothing but the best of intentions in mind for me.”
Waterwalker looked at Bertulu. “From this day forth, you are one of
my friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, good!”
Bertulu nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he looked at
Waterwalker, he felt as though he was looking at himself all those
years ago. The only difference was that Waterwalker had been abducted
shortly after being born, whereas Bertulu himself had wandered the
primordial chaos for countless years and had experienced many, many
things. He had experienced both grief and joy, gatherings and
partings. All of these things had come together to allow him to walk
the path of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two islands became
one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a single astral
island was now left within the fifth stratum. Ji Ning’s astral
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I the last one?”
The white-robed Ning was seated in the lotus position atop a grassy
area within his astral island, Violetjewel resting across his knees.
He had been waiting here for quite some time now, but Bertulu had
unexpectedly chosen to save him for last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here it comes.”
Ning’s gaze turned towards the golden book next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A challenge had finally
appeared within his golden book, a challenge that came from the sixth
stratum. This was a challenge Ning had never received before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve spent a
thousand years in the Astral Islands waiting for this battle.” Ning
sent out a strand of his will, shattering the message of challenge.
Challenge accepted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That guy in the
sixth stratum is truly invincible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s way too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the islands of the
Astral Islands had been in a state of breathless excitement for the
past fifteen days. They had watched as one island after another
descended from the fifth stratum. Every single person within the
fifth stratum was a freak of a genius, no matter what path they
walked or what Dao they were skilled yet. And yet, Bertulu had
crushed and defeated all of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a single island
remained within the fifth stratum. Once this island was also
defeated, there would be no islands in the fifth stratum at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment in time,
all of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators present here were
completely focused on what was going to happen. They were awaiting
the final resolution to this momentous event.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very bottom of
the dark abyss below the Astral Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment there
were more than ten figures gathered here, including that of the
muscular man with tousled black hair who was dressed in simple combat
garbs. Their auras were as profound as that of the endless sea of
stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bertulu truly is
formidable in heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This should be his
final battle in the Astral Islands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After he finishes
sweeping through all his opponents, he will probably leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He still has yet to
tell us if he will be joining the Palace of Radiance or the Palace of
Heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These ancient powers
were all chatting amongst themselves. All of them had been keeping an
eye on Bertulu for quite some time now. In fact, even the almighty
Hegemon had been paying attention to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of cultivation
had three main branches; Fiendgod Body Refining, Ki Refining, and
Heartforce Cultivating. Ji Ning was a dual refiner who trained both
as a Fiendgod and as a Ki Refiner! However, it was actually possible
to be a triple refiner who trained in heartforce as well! Bertulu was
one such cultivator, and people like him were the most terrifying
opponents one could face. If Bertulu could use his heartforce to even
slightly affect his opponent, he would then be able to easily
dominate that person through his terrifying close combat skills. In
fact, there were many who Bertulu could defeat without even having to
lift a finger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, just one battle
is left?” A voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-bearded elder
dressed in snowy robes who had six curved horns on his head suddenly
appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten-plus ancient
powers gathered here were all shocked. They hastily bowed with
respect. “Hegemon!”

Chapter 44 - Ji Ning Battles Bertulu
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon,
the most exalted figure in all the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of him, the
Brightshore Kingdom sprang into existence. Because of him, there
existed the Brightshore Imperials and the Twelve Palaces of
Brightshore. Because of him, the kingdom was qualified to stand
alongside the Dao Alliance and the Aeonian Kingdom as one of the most
supreme powers of the Endless Territories. In front of him, even the
most unruly of ancient powers would have to bow their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is the latest
batch of newcomer kids doing?” The six-horned, white-bearded old
man slowly saunted towards them. Spacetime began to congeal and
condense in the area around him. Although he wasn’t intentionally
flaring his aura, the tiny bit of it that was naturally leaking out
of him was more than enough to make all the members of the imperial
clan or the Twelve Palace to feel as though they could barely
breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The newbies? That
kid named Waterwalker has superb innate gifts. The others are a bit
lacking by comparison.” An incredibly muscular golden-armored man
spoke out. This man was a bit excessively muscular. Even though he
had already shrank down from his true size, his arms were still
thicker than his head. There was clearly a bit of a mismatch in
proportions. “Bertulu himself said that Waterwalker’s innate
gifts are comparable to the gifts of us Imperials or those Ancient
cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His innate gifts are
indeed quite good. Unfortunately, he doesn’t really understand
anything.” The white-bearded elder nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for those
geniuses which Bertulu just battled against, he was able to defeat
them all with ease. None of them can even compare to him.” The
muscular golden-armored man laughed. “Hegemon, Bertulu truly is
quite talented in the Dao of Light. Let him enter our Palace of
Radiance! I can promise that I’ll take him on as my personal
disciple and provide him personal guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This muscular man was
an incredibly famous figure in the Endless Territories known as
Daolord Thousand Waves. He was one of the two Palace Lords of the
Radiant Palace, a figure who was capable of causing tremendous waves
within the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are so few
Heartforce Cultivators. Thousand Waves, why must you fight with me
over one?” A figured covered in black robes spoke out in an ancient
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Palace of
Heartforce barely has any Daolords in it.” Daolord Thousandwaves
spoke in an utterly indomitable fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we are few
in number, each of us has the power of ten or a hundred men,” the
illusory, formless figure underneath the black robes said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? The power of
ten? Then why don’t you have someone in your Heartforce Palace come
spar with me a bit?” Light began to gather within the eyes of
Daolord Thousand Waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed figure
was instantly rendered speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Thousand Waves
was one of the top ten experts of all the Twelve Palaces. If the
Palace Lord of the Heartforce Palace was around, he might give
Thousand Waves a run for his money, but he was out wandering the
endless primordial chaos and hadn’t returned in more than ten chaos
cycles. At present, there really was no one in the Heartforce Palace
who was a match for Daolord Thousand Waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes
for Bertulu to make his choice, the two of you can do your best to
recruit him.” The white-bearded elder smiled. “I won’t get
involved. Enough. These two kids are about to start their duel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of moving
images appeared in the air next to them. This was what was occurring
within the dueling island. Ji Ning and Bertulu had just met each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth isn’t
bad either. Unfortunately, his opponent is Bertulu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how long he
will be able to hold on for?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That entirely
depends on how long Bertulu wishes to play around for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what all the
major powers were saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They truly had very
high opinions of Bertulu. It must be understood that the Astral
Islands had helped train many groups of geniuses over the course of
countless years, but it had been an extremely long period of time
since someone had excited them as much as Bertulu. This was because
Bertulu simply had an incredible level of insight into the Dao. It
could be said that as soon as he broke through to become a Daolord of
the First Step, he would instantly become capable of matching
Daolords of the Third Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he spent a little
bit of time training and became a Daolord of the Second Step, he
would be capable of battling Verge-level Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although others such as
Gorho were also capable of becoming Daolords whenever they wished, no
one in the Twelve Palaces really cared about him, even though they
knew that he was an Aeonian! So what if he was an Aeonian? Even
Eternal Emperor Melobo of the Aeonians had been severely beaten and
chased around by Daolord Allgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gorho’s level of
enlightenment was far inferior to Bertulu’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bertulu really is at
the point where he should be breaking through to the Daolord level
soon.” A look of anticipation was in the white-bearded elder’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major powers
were staring at the midair images, watching as the battle was about
to begin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The oceanic island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth who
carried a sword on his back was staring off into the distance. He saw
a white-robed, white-haired youth off in the distance, a youth whose
eyes seemed to contain the all the stars of the cosmos. When Ning saw
those eyes, he couldn’t help but be affected by their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.” Ning
was secretly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my name
is Bertulu.” The white-haired youth spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bertulu. I’ve
heard of you, and I’ve been waiting for this battle for quite some
time,” Ning said. For some reason, although they had yet to fight
Ning already felt a sense of tremendous pressure. “The stronger he
is, the better. I want to see how powerful a World-level cultivator
can become.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should be the
strongest individual in the group of newcomers.” Bertulu smiled. “I
hope you won’t disappoint me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then take out your
weapon,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take out my weapon?”
Bertulu smiled. “Let’s see if you are strong enough first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was
Ning’s first time meeting Bertulu, he had heard long ago that
Bertulu generally used his bare palms when fighting in close combat.
The only time he had ever used his weapons was in his battles against
Kilostar! This was Kilostar’s evaluation: “Only once you fight
him yourself will you truly understand how powerful he is. He is
powerful enough to drive a man into despair. Only by using my
thousand bodies formation am I able to make it so that he can do
nothing to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop a
mountain boulder. His body momentarily blurred as he manifested three
heads and six arms, a sword in each of his six hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Bertulu
laughed, then began to stride through the air towards Ning. As he did
so, he delivered a punch from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His punch seemed
to strike out with the power of a meteor as its power crushed through
Heaven and Earth, slamming down towards Ning from the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face tightened
slightly, the desire to do battle growing even stronger in his heart.
His opponent was fighting empty-handed, while he himself was using
six Eternal swords. He had a huge advantage in this fight. “I have
to force him to take out his weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning’s sword
moved, transforming into a streak of absolutely dominating
blood-colored light as it struck out against that fist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it seemed to
merely graze Bertulu’s fist, it instantly was able to have an
impact on his fist technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Interesting.”
Bertulu laughed as he continued to stride forwards. He manifested six
arms as well, then began to rain down blows with his fists like
countless meteors shooting through the skies. His palms were like
massive screens that blotted out the skies, and his fingers seemed to
tear through everything in the world. Even though he still merely
used his bare hands, his six hands were still strong enough to put
pressure upon Ning with each strike. As for Ning, his pride prevented
him from using his Elementum Waterflame Gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Bertulu was
strong, he was fighting empty-handed. Ning was already using six
Eternal weapons against Bertulu’s bare hands; how could Ning
possibly take out the gourd as well? If he lost in a situation like
this, he would be thoroughly convinced of the latter’s superiority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu circled around
Ning at high speeds as he attacked, his aura flaring out and filling
the heavens with each strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time I watch
Bertulu fight, I enjoy myself immensely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I truly would
never have imagined that a World-level cultivator could reach such a
high level of insight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers in
the dark abyss all sighed as they watched this battle go on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded elder
nodded slowly. “When Dawnstar was at the World level, his
saber-arts were comparable to Bertulu’s fist techniques. However,
Dawnstar was merely a dual refiner who did not train in heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dawnstar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord
Dawnstar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was this powerful
as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Palace
Lord Dawnstar is so powerful now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the ancient powers
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without question, the
most powerful Daolord of the Twelve Palaces was Palace Lord Dawnstar.
He was the Palace Lord of the Palace of the Saber. Although he was
‘merely’ a Verge-level Daolord, on one occasion when he was
enraged he had slain an ancient Eternal Emperor with just three
strokes of his saber. His reputation was instantly spread throughout
the Endless Territories! He was so dominatingly powerful that he was
even stronger than Daolord Allgod had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the Hegemon to
compare Bertulu to Palace Lord Dawnstar was a sign of how great his
expectations were for Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Bertulu
repeatedly circled around Ning and furiously assaulted him, he was
unable to injure Ning in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s all you
have, you won’t even be able to scratch me,” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are indeed
worthy of making me use a weapon.” A sword suddenly appeared in
each of Bertulu’s hands, and each sword was an Eternal weapon. The
area around him became filled with endless flickers of light, and
Bertulu himself was like the divine lord of the lights as he once
more charged at Ning with those six swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His swords struck out
in a fierce, dominating fashion. Ning was forced to defend with all
his might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What powerful
sword-arts! Still, the stronger he is the better.” Ning only grew
even more excited. The Thunderlight Wings suddenly appeared on his
back, bolstering his footwork techniques. Each flutter of the wings
and each step Ning took was like a stance from a sword-art. His
movements and his attacks had all joined together into a perfect
whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out with
his six Violetjewels simultaneously, transforming them into six
streaks of bloody light that slashed out through the skies. Each
time, he was able to defend against Bertulu’s swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually able
to defend against me?” Bertulu was rather startled. He called out,
“What is your sword-art named?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During my thousand
years here at the Astral Islands, I merged the Unicorn’s Heart
stance with my Astral stance and created a defensive technique,”
Ning replied. “I named it the Unicorn’s Domain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unicorn’s Domain?”
Bertulu was slightly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Domain
represented Ning’s most profound insights into the Dao of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Heart
represented a certain level of insight into the sword that was
focused on defense. Much like how the Heartsword stance represented
the heart having full control of the sword and the world around it,
or the Great Firmanent stance represented the power of an entire
world, this stance represented a type of domain that was even more
profound than the Unicorn’s Heart. Ning had used the essence of the
Unicorn’s Heart and fused it with the even more powerful Astral
stance to create this domain, his Unicorn’s Domain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was able to defend
against any attacks that entered this domain. Each time, his defenses
were able to deflect and then counterattack the enemy. The Astral
stance was merely a ‘tool’ in that using it with Violetjewel
resulted in tremendous gains in power. For him to incorporate it into
his Unicorn’s Domain and use it to defend or deflect just made the
power of the domain even greater and more effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on this
technique, Ning had been able to finally defeat the fisherman in the
third Mirrorsnow Painting. However, Ning’s sword-arts had since
reached a true bottleneck, which was why he had decided to leave the
Astral islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the most
powerful sword-art I have at present,” Ning said. “Bertulu, I’ve
already activated my Unicorn’s Domain. If you can defeat this
domain of mine, I will admit defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, good. Aside
from Kilostar, you are the only person in all the Astral Islands
capable of forcing me to use my true weapons.” Suddenly, the six
swords vanished from Bertulu’s hands. Moments later, two heavy
warhammers appeared. One warhammer was black while the other was
white, and both were Eternal weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
fist techniques you used earlier, I actually guessed that you
specialize in something aside from sword-arts. It seems as though my
guess was correct. You actually specialize in hammer-arts, using your
hands as your hammers, right? Come. Let us see if you can break my
Unicorn’s Domain.” Ning had absolute confidence in his Unicorn’s
Domain. This was a technique which was perfect for a weaker
cultivator to defend against a stronger foe with. It was a defensive
sword-art that avoiding facing a stronger foe’s attacks head-on.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers
watched the images of the battle from their position in the dark
abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s infused an
attacking sword-art into a defensive domain, but managed to keep the
essence of his domain intact.” A partially bald man let out a
laugh. “Although Darknorth isn’t a match for Bertulu, he’s
still quite a rare talent. Once he enters our Palace of the Sword,
we’ll give him some good training. Perhaps a miracle will happen
and he will be able to be Bertulu’s equal in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has this kid even
chosen your Sword Palace yet? Even if he has, should really be so
shameless in praising him? His sword-arts aren’t bad and have
reached incredible heights in terms of defensiveness, but for him to
be Bertulu’s match in the future? Haha, how many Bertulus do you
think our Brightshore Kingdom will give rise to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Woodflower,
you are going a bit too far in your praise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, Woodflower
belongs to the Sword Palace. It isn’t surprising for him to praise
someone else who will be in his palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do have to admit
that Darknorth’s defensive abilities are quite excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers all
gave their own opinions as they watched Ning and Bertulu continue to
furiously battle against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
world itself was breaking apart. Space had been shattered and
distorted, and each of those two warhammers carried enough power to
cause this entire world to tremble. Ning had to use three or four
swords to block each attack; for him to use just a single sword was
no longer enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he is
skilled in using heavy warhammers, I imagine he only has two of these
Eternal warhammers.” Ning was able to hang on with some difficulty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, it was with
quite a bit of difficulty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu was most
skilled in hammer-arts, and he sent his attacks forward in an open,
straightforward, and awe-inspiring display of power! Ning was being
completely crushed in this fight, and he was only able to just barely
survive because his newly developed Unicorn Domain allowed him to
perfectly execute every strike and avoid facing the power of each
hammer head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His hammer-art is so
profound that I can’t even understand it. Although the golden-robed
emperor in the Mirrorsnow Painting also had an open and
straightforward fighting style, there is obviously an enormous
difference between the two of them!” Ning couldn’t help but sigh.
If the golden-robed emperor was described as a child who had just
learned to walk, then Bertulu was a valiant warrior who bounded to
and fro with the fierceness of a tiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning had
infused his Astral stance into this Unicorn’s Domain. Otherwise, if
he was merely relying on the Unicorn’s Heart stance, he would have
been completely unable to withstand this assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
still able to hold on?” Bertulu was slightly startled as well. He
then called out, “Watch out, Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world around him
suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he had been
on an oceanic island that was surrounded by an endless sea. Although
the island had begun to crumble from the effects of their fight, the
endless waters of the sea hadn’t changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning now
realized to his astonishment that the world around him had completely
changed. It had become a world of rolling plains and towering
mountains, and at the very peak of one mountain there was a sacred
shrine that glowed with breathtaking light, allowing the great plains
to bask in its radiance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and
Bertulu, they were battling within the plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow and Ji
Yichuan both appeared. They were staring at Ning, eyes filled with
joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei appeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of invisible
power had been applied to Ning’s truesoul, pulling his deepest
desires and most sacred memories out from the bottom of his heart.
Ning’s heart was forever occupied with his longing for his father,
his mother, and for Yu Wei. They had been the most important people
in his life, and he deeply desired to one day rescue Yu Wei and allow
their family of three to reunite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
continued to battle furiously against Bertulu, not allowing any of
this to affect him in the slightest. He let out a furious roar,
causing Yuchi Snow, Ji Yichuan, and Yu Wei to all vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually wasn’t
affected by it.” Bertulu was a bit surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
heartforce illusion. Eh?” Ning’s face turned slightly pale as he
realized that he was still surrounded by rolling plains and towering
mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the Endwar
of the Three Realms, Ning’s Dao-heart had continuously risen and
grown more powerful. As he mastered the Heartsword stance, his own
heartforce had reached the threshold of the fifth stage of
heartforce. The problem was that he was still just a hair away from
making that breakthrough. Although his heartforce was quite strong,
it was nothing compared to Bertulu’s heartforce illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s
strongest aspect was his truesoul! His truesoul was bathed in the
power of the azureflower mist energy, causing it to be comparable to
that of a Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who wished to
successfully bewilder Ning would have to overwhelm his truesoul with
a heartforce technique or some other secret art. Take Eternal
Emperors for example. Eternal Emperors might go insane or berserk in
some instances, but to shake their truesouls would be almost
impossibly hard. Ning’s truesoul was incredibly powerful, and he
had decently strong heartforce as well. This was why he had been able
to withstand the illusions just now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth! As
Bertulu continued to battle against Ning, he suddenly let out a loud
shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plains around them
suddenly split apart. Many long chains began to fly out from within
the crevices and spin towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More illusions?
Break!” Ning willed his powerful truesoul and mighty will to cause
all these things to dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, illusions? You
underestimate us Heartforce Cultivators. What is illusory is real,
what is real is illusory.” Bertulu shook his head. “What you are
seeing is all real.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no time to do
anything else. Swoosh! A crimson-black gourd suddenly appeared next
to him, then released two streaks of lightning that shot out like
dragons. One streak of lightning caused dark stormclouds to gather as
it shot out, with the other causing crimson clouds of flame to appear
around it. The two swept out against the surroundings, incinerating
and shattering the chains that had sought to bind Ning. Alas, the
chains reformed after being broken apart and continued to attack Ning
in an endless stream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two streaks of Dao
lightning destroyed everything in the surrounding area, and Ning was
like the god of lightning himself. Even Bertulu, who had been
fighting Ning in close combat, was impacted by the lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omnipresence.”
Bertulu said this word calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, golden light
began to emanate from every single part of the plains. Endless
streams of golden light surrounded Ning, constricting him and slowing
him down. The two streaks of Dao lightly furiously hammered down upon
the light, but it was omnipresent and inescapable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Ning took
direct control over the two streaks of Dao lightning, sending them
sweeping out against everything around him in a net.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warhammers
continued their dance, causing the earth to shake and the mountains
to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords
continuously formed Unicorn’s Domains, allowing him to defend with
some difficulty. Thankfully, Ning had the azureflower mist energy
supporting him, giving him the strength to withstand his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s stop here.”
Bertulu suddenly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rolling plains and
towering mountains around them all vanished, as did the shrine atop
the mountain. The surrounding area returned to its normal, ‘real’
appearance. The island had long ago been completely reduced to
rubble. The two were standing in the middle of the air, surrounded by
the endless waves of the ocean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop?” Ning was
slightly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though he had
taken out his Elementum Waterflame Gourd, he still found it extremely
hard to hold on. He could sense that defeat might come at any moment,
but he had continued to do his best to delay the inevitable for as
long as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat,”
Bertulu suddenly said in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You admit what?”
Ning was stunned. His foe’s hammer-arts were incredibly, incredibly
profound. In addition, Ning could sense that Bertulu hadn’t really
been going all-out in the fight; he had simply been fighting in a
fairly casual, relaxed matter. Despite that, Ning had been able to
sense that he was going to lose soon, if for no other reason than the
fact that he was perpetually on the defense and unable to launch any
attacks of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I promised Kilostar
that I would transfer this heartforce legacy over to him.” Bertulu
suddenly produced a single white feather. “This duel was my final
duel. After this, I will be leaving the Astral Islands. Before
leaving, I wanted to hand this heartforce legacy over to you. After
you learn it, challenge Kilostar and transfer it to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he sent
the white plume flying towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Oh.” Ning
accepted the plume blankly. This white plume was the heartforce
legacy that was ranked number one amongst the ninety-nine legacies.
It had been in Bertulu’s hands all this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you obviously
were stronger than me…” Ning stared at Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for me to be so stubborn about a mere duel in the Astral Islands.”
Bertulu laughed calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… you are a
special lifeform! You haven’t even revealed your true form.” Ning
couldn’t help but argue back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had battled against
quite a few special lifeforms in recent years. He knew that these
special lifeforms had all used shapeshifting techniques to take a
humanoid form. Cultivators were generally humanoids, and they were
the most numerous living creatures in all the Endless Territories.
However, special lifeforms who were in human form were often only
able to unleash perhaps ten to twenty percent of their true power.
Once they revealed their true forms, they would become far more
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they also possessed
powerful innate abilities, they would become even more freakishly
strong once they assumed their true forms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true form?”
Bertulu laughed as he glanced at Ning. “I’ve never shown my true
form in the Astral Islands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exit,” Bertulu
called out. Instantly, spacetime twisted around him and caused him to
vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
blankly, that white plume in his hands. He had won, right? Then why
did he feel so pissed off? He hadn’t even had the chance to see
Bertulu’s true form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bottom of the dark
abyss. The ancient powers were still watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once saw Bertulu’s
true form. The first time I saw him, I misidentified him as an
Ancient cultivator.” Daolord Thousand Waves let out a loud laugh.
“This kid has never used his true body in any of his duels in the
Astral Islands. Each time, he’s only used his human form.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the level of
his insights, if he uses his true form he would probably be able to
slay Daolords of the First Step right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He should be at the
absolute maximum level of power, theoretical or otherwise, for any
World-level cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ancient cultivators as
well as the Brightshore Imperials represented the ultimate heights of
racial power. They were very rare in number, but they possessed
utterly unearthly levels of power. Waterwalker was a special lifeform
who was comparable to Ancient cultivators in power, while Bertulu
possessed similarly strong innate gifts. If he truly did reveal his
true body, he would instantly become more than ten times as powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Bertulu has
already decided to leave the Astral Islands.” The white-bearded
elder laughed merrily. “It will be up to the two of you to convince
him to join either the Palace of Radiance or the Palace of
Heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, the
white-bearded old man turned and walked away, disappearing into the
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Thousand
Waves, the Heartforce Palace really does need more Daolords! We don’t
have enough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Daolords
quickly flew out of the dark abyss and towards the astral islands in
the sky.

Chapter 46 - Heartforce Legacy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?” Kilostar stared in astonishment from within his own
astral island. The highest astral island, the island within the sixth
stratum, was actually descending?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could Bertulu
have lost?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth beat
Bertulu? Is this some kind of joke?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the other defeated
geniuses, be they cultivators, Aeonians, or special lifeforms, were
all in a state of disbelief. They all knew how powerful Bertulu was,
which was why they completely refused to believe that he could’ve
been defeated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of thousands
of cultivators watched as Bertulu’s island descended from the
exalted sixth stratum. All of them were equally stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were currently
two islands that floated within the fifth stratum. Ji Ning was seated
within his own island, and he was mumbling to himself. “He lost on
purpose? Did he think I’d be really happy once I won? I didn’t
even get to see his true form…” Ning didn’t feel any excitement
at this ‘victory’, because he knew his opponent had thrown the
fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still… I didn’t
expect to get a copy of the heartforce legacy before leaving.” Ning
waved his hand, causing that white plume to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white plume was
incredibly beautiful. This single feather was actually formed from
3600 strands of silk. Ning sent his senses into it, discovering the
legacy hiding within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I didn’t
expect to acquire it, being able to learn it is a decent stroke of
luck.” Ning immediately swore the oath required of him, allowing an
enormous flood of complicated information to flood into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had some
talent for the water, lightning, and heartforce, he hadn’t really
been planning on spending too much effort on them. There was a limit
to how much energy he had, and he had chosen to pour it all into his
Dao of the Sword. His advantage in this field was far greater than in
the other fields, and he naturally wanted to focus more on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those other
Daos, once he had some more leisure time or once he reached an
unbreachable bottleneck in the Dao of the Sword, he would slowly
spend some time getting his other Daos up to speed. Daolord Allgod
was a good example. Only after becoming a Verge-level Daolord had he
chosen to start studying the Dao of the Sword. By then, his overall
level of understanding regarding the Dao was so great that he was
able to train quite quickly in his secondary or tertiary Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Ji Ning became a
Verge-level Daolord, he would probably be able to reach the early
Daolord level in water in just one day. After that, his training
would also proceed quite quickly. It was entirely possible that he’d
be able to progress to the Verge in water as well. But of course, if
his innate affinity for a Dao was low, training in it would be
extremely slow. Daolord Allgod had spent an tremendous amount of
effort in order to upgrade his skill in the Dao of the Sword to the
early Daolord level, which was why he himself had declared that he
simply had no talent for the Dao of the Sword at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would probably
have to spend a hundred times as much effort in training in the Dao
of Water in order to make it comparable to my Dao of the Sword, and
it wouldn’t even help me that much. If I put all that work into the
sword instead, I’ll improve far more.” Ning understood this quite
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long period of time
passed. Finally, Ning finished memorizing the heartforce legacy. It
truly was the top legacy of the ninety-ninety legacies of the Astral
Islands, and it contained a correspondingly enormous amount of
information.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is what
being a true Heartforce Cultivator is all about.” Ning was
stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He finally understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce could be
divided into six stages. The first five stages were essentially the
stages which Houyi had described.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stage was the
elementary level. It was extremely hard to reach the first level; if
you couldn’t succeed in it, you would have no hope of progressing
as a Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stage,
‘iceheart’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stage,
‘ruler’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage,
‘mortal dust’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had reached the
mortal dust level long ago during the Crimsonbright Realmwar. Even
though the Endwar and its various battles had an enormous impact on
Ning, and he had reached the threshold of the fifth stage after
seeing so many of the major powers of the Three Realms die. Alas, he
still stubbornly clung on to certain things and was unable to truly
let go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stage,
‘truth’. This was a very high level of heartforce for most
cultivators. To reach this level was extremely difficult! Strength
didn’t have much to do it with it. Although many powerful
cultivators had gained their power through enormous mental tempering
and stress, resulting in them possessing powerful hearts, there were
many special lifeforms such as Waterwalker who were born with
incredible power but who had very weak hearts. Waterwalker hadn’t
even reached the elementary stage of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stage,
‘world’. This was the highest level of heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After your
heartforce reaches the stage of ‘truth’, you will be able to see
through the truth of all things. Your heartforce will transform,
allowing all your thoughts and desires to coalesce into a sea of
consciousness. You will then be able to establish your own
heartworld,” Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, he understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to reaching the
sixth stage, heartforce could only be used in fairly crude ways. In
the Endless Territories, Old Man Yuan would be considered a
Heartforce Cultivator by Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals, but
technically speaking he wasn’t a true Heartforce Cultivator. He was
just someone who understood certain heartforce secret arts, but those
arts were enough for quite a few Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
to refer to him as a Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually World-level
Heartforce Cultivators were incredibly rare. There was simply no way
for someone like Old Man Yuan to rely on heartforce to reach the
World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once your heartforce
reached the sixth stage, all of your heartforce would pool together
within that sea of consciousness. If your heartforce was strong
enough, it could affect reality itself, forming a singularity where
what was real and what was false would collide. A single grain of
sand could become an entire real world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ki Refiners
cultivate Immortal ki and the Dao-tree in their bodies will
continuously grow taller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgod Body
Refiners cultivate divine power and their divine bodies will
continuously grow stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce
Cultivators cultivate their worlds. They need to establish their
heartworlds, with their insights into the Dao perfecting those worlds
and making them more and more real.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured softly,
“Heartforce Cultivators truly are unique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were three
completely different paths of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison,
Heartforce Cultivators didn’t need to gain incredibly profound
insights into the Dao. What they needed to do was to slowly build up
their heartworlds, allowing their heartworlds to become increasingly
like real worlds. Only when their heartworlds became sufficiently
stable could they be expanded… but it was possible for heartworlds
to become greater than entire territories in size. In fact, they
could become greater than a hundred territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The larger a heartworld
was, the more powerful a Heartforce Cultivator was! This was because
all the World energy within this heartworld would be available to the
Heartforce Cultivator to command. If the heartworld was the size of a
territory, then its ‘heartworld projection’ alone would be able
to crush Verge-level Daolords to death, to say nothing of someone
like Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I fought
against Bertulu, he caused the area around us to transform into a
world of grassy plains and tall mountains. I thought that was all
just an illusion… but it was actually his heartworld projection.”
Ning finally understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The manifestation of a
heartworld projection was a symbol of all the power of an entire
world being brought to bear! Even Ning felt constricted and
restrained by its power. If it had been an ordinary master-class
World God, that person probably would’ve been crushed straight to
death! Even Ning was forced to use his Elementum Waterflame Gourd in
order to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Fiendgods and Ki
Refiners had to pursue increasingly greater heights in the Dao, but
Heartforce Cultivators focused on greater stability in their
heartworlds. Only with great stability would they be able to expand
the size of their heartworld. As a result, Daos that were excessively
oriented in a certain direction were actually unsuitable for
inclusion in a heartworld! What heartworlds truly needed were highly
stable and balanced Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To make the false
real, to make the real false. The goal of Heartforce Cultivators is
to make their heartworlds into true worlds, to make that which is
illusory into something which is real.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once they reach that
level… with but a thought, a Heartforce Cultivator can produce a
hundred Eternal weapons within his heartworld, and those Eternal
weapons will all be real. He will be able to pull them out and use
them in battle. With but a thought, he would be able to produce
powerful pills, golems…” Ning was frightened just thinking about
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, according to the
heartforce legacy this only happened at the absolute apex of power.
In addition, it didn’t contain any instructions on how to actually
reach this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t even
reached the fifth stage of heartforce yet.” Ning shook his head,
putting away the white plume. He had to reach the sixth stage of
heartforce before he would even have his own heartworld. Only then
would he be able to use the guidance of this legacy, which would
teach him how to quickly and stably expand his own heartworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder there are
so few Heartforce Cultivators. To reach the sixth stage of heartforce
is impossibly difficult.” Ning shook his head. Even Houyi himself
had most likely failed to reach the sixth stage of heartforce. The
only person Ning knew of who had reached the sixth stage of
heartforce was Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day later, Ning
challenged Kilostar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.” Ning
handed the white plume to Kilostar. “Bertulu asked me to transfer
this to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it. I knew he
had to have thrown the fight.” Kilostar looked at Ning. “Oh,
right. What weapons did he use?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hammers,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually forced
him to use his hammers? Oh! Did you see his true form?” Kilostar
was quite curious. Although he was on decent terms with Bertulu, he
had never been able to get Bertulu to show his true form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Ning shook
his head. “Now that I’ve given you this legacy, my business here
is done. Kilostar, if you ever want to meet me you can go to the
Palace of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are leaving? So
soon?” Kilostar was quite surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ll be
leaving soon as well. You will be in the Sword Palace while I will be
in the Saber Palace.” Kilostar nodded. “Let’s see which of us
will be the first to become a Samsara Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s see
who makes it first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning bid Kilostar
farewell, he shattered the talisman which a Daolord of the Sword
Palace had given him. The only members of the Twelve Palaces who had
come to visit Ning had been from the Sword Palace or the Thunder
Palace.

Chapter 47 - Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood within
his astral island by himself, staring at the emptiness around his
island. The island which had represented Bertulu had already
descended into the dark abyss, because Bertulu had already left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light
suddenly flew towards him from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately turned
to look. The person who had flown over was an azure-armored alien
Daolord. This man was fairly ugly, and his skin was a coarse,
dark-red color. Although he looked rather frightening, Ning knew that
this man, Daolord Grayvast, was actually a very good man who was easy
to get along with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.”
The azure-armored, muscular-looking Daolord Grayvast landed on the
island, then laughed. “You are planning to leave so soon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“My sword-arts have reached a bottleneck. It’ll probably be quite
some time before I can improve any further. In addition, I understand
more than half of the more powerful experts are planning to leave as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu had left,
Kilostar was leaving, and many of the old timers were leaving as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You might as well.
The Sword Palace is a much better place than this place.” Daolord
Grayvast laughed. “Even in the Endless Territories, our Palace of
the Sword is considered a holy land for those who train in the Dao of
the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
agreement. Brightshore Kingdom was an organization on the same
general level of power as the Dao Alliance and the Aeonian Kingdom.
Almost all of its elite cultivators in the Dao of the Sword were
gathered within the Palace of the Sword. One could imagine what an
accumulation of wealth, talent, and legacies it had accumulated over
the course of countless ages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Senior
Grayvast, please have a seat first.” Ning hurriedly produced some
Immortal wine, personally filling Daolord Grayvast’s cup. He asked
curiously, “Bertulu’s astral island has already sank into that
dark abyss. That means he should’ve left already. Senior, do you
know which palace he chose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t the
only one curious about this. Many of the Daolords have been paying
attention to him as well.” Daolord Grayvast sat down, then picked
up a cup of wine and gave it a sip. “In the end, he chose the
Palace of Radiance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Radiant Palace?”
Ning was startled. “He plans to walk the Dao of Light?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce Cultivators
were incredibly powerful. Daolord Featherdress, who had left behind
the heartforce legacy, was publicly acknowledged as the most powerful
Daolord in the Endless Territories during his era! After gaining this
legacy, Ning came to understand that once a heartworld reached truly
massive proportions, a simple heartworld projection would be enough
to crush an opponent to death. Even if it didn’t directly kill
one’s opponent, it could still suppress and restrict them, causing
them to be limited to a mere twenty percent of their true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And Heartforce
Cultivators had more tricks up their sleeves than just that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choosing the Dao of
Light is the most stable, appropriate path.” Daolord Grayvast let
out a sigh. “Everyone knows how powerful and inscrutable Heartforce
Cultivators are, but training in heartforce is simply too difficult.
There are incredibly few World-level Heartforce Cultivators. As for
Daolords who are Heartforce Cultivators… very few of them exist in
the Endless Territories. The Heartforce Palace is one of the Twelve
Palaces, but it has a total of less than ten Daolords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Grayvast shook
his head. “The Dao of Light is actually a fairly normal Dao in
comparison. Bertulu can focus on the Dao of Light while spending some
time in heartforce as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I think
about it…” Ning said softly, “When I fought against him, he
only used his heartworld projection to suppress me, then engaged me
in close combat. He didn’t really use a lot of heartforce
techniques. It seems as though he decided long ago that he would use
heartforce as a supporting skill. His main focus is on fighting in
close combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A very solid
choice.” Daolord Grayvast sighed. “This solid choice means that
we can already imagine how dazzlingly powerful he will be in the
future. In fact, if he successfully walks down the path he has
started on, he will become either the Palace Lord or a vice Palace
Lord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chatted and drank
with Daolord Grayvast, learning much more about the Twelve Palaces.
Soon, the wine was all finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a
teleportation array within the Astral Islands. It can send you
straight to the Sword Palace.” Daolord Grayvast rose to his feet as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head. “I have a good friend who came with me to the
Brightshore Kingdom. She is currently somewhere in the Brightshore
Kingdom. I plan to find her first, then I’ll go to the Sword
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Daolord
Grayvast frowned slightly, then solemnly handed over a medallion.
This medallion looked illusory and translucent, but one could vaguely
make out the word ‘sword’ on the medallion. Daolord Grayvast
handed the medallion over to Ning. “Technically speaking, you
should only be given this medallion after you go to the Sword Palace
and become one of our formal members. However, since you need to find
your friend first, I’ll let you bind this medallion right now. Once
you bind it, you’ll be one of our formal members.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. “You
are going to give it to me in advance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom is a dangerous place,” Daolord Grayvast explained. “If I
didn’t give it to you… you might end up dying while traveling to
the Sword Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom is an extremely large place with countless living beings
within it. The almighty Hegemon actually went out of his way to
personally create many dangers, hiding many legacies within those
dangers,” Daolord Grayvast explained. “He wishes for the
countless living beings within the Brightshore Kingdom to be filled
with energy and courage. If everything is too peaceful and everyone
lives in peace, the kingdom will produce far, far fewer major
powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
principle. A peaceful life sapped one’s willpower. Even chaosworlds
were filled with battle, to say nothing of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who becomes a
Daolord is required to join the Twelve Palaces,” Daolord Grayvast
said. “Within the Twelve Palaces, all internal strife is forbidden.
Even if you do hold a grudge against someone, we would encourage you
to do your best to resolve things peacefully through mediation. If
the mediation fails, you will still have to get advance permission
before entering into a life-and-death duel. If you dare to kill one
of your colleagues without getting that permission, you will be
devoured by your lifeblood oath and killed on the spot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many of the Daolords
will leave the Brightshore Kingdom to adventure through the outside
lands.” Daolord Grayvast laughed. “If you want to kill people, do
it outside. Don’t kill other Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you bind this
medallion, none of the Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom will dare
to lay a finger on you,” Daolord Grayvast said. “That will make
things much safer for you! To physically travel from this place to
the Sword Palace means crossing more than half of the entire
Brightshore Kingdom. There will be many Daolords on the way,
including some special lifeforms who have bad tempers or strange
dispositions. There are some who will slaughter anyone who crosses
their path…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless
upon hearing all this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So… hurry up and
bind it,” Daolord Grayvast urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sent
his senses into the medallion. This medallion did indeed hold a
lifeblood oath within it that was quite similar to the one which
Daolord Grayvast had just described. The Twelve Palaces forbade its
members from engaging in internal combat. In addition, if the
Brightshore Imperials or the Twelve Palaces fell into danger, the
members of the palaces would have to do their utmost to rescue them.
But of course, if one of the Imperials sought to kill you then you
would be permitted to fight back; there would be no need to defend
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Twelve Palaces
must protect the imperial clan?” Ning raised his head to look at
Daolord Grayvast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protecting the imperial
clan was actually part of the charter of the lifeblood oath. But of
course, in order to ensure that the experts of the Twelve Palaces
were sincere in their loyalty, the Brightshore Imperials also had to
swear oaths that they absolutely would not attack any members of the
Twelve Palaces. If they did, they would no logner be protected and
they could instead be counter-attacked and killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord
Grayvast nodded. “The Brightshore Kingdom was established by the
almighty Hegemon. He created the Brightshore Kingdom for the sake of
protecting his imperial clan. Although the Imperials are very
powerful, they are extremely few in number.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could also sense
what an extraordinary aura this medallion had. Most likely, it was
the almighty Hegemon himself who had created this medallion as well
as the lifeblood oath. But of course, the Twelve Palaces had to agree
with the wording of the oath. Only then would such a mighty
organization have staying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose I can
accept that.” Ning immediately swore the lifeblood oath. The
medallion was instantly and easily bound as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As soon as he
bound the medallion, Ning could sense ten ripples of power coming
from the Astral Islands region. These were ripples emanating from
other similar medallions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Twelve Palaces
and the Brightshore Imperials all have similar medallions. The
ripples coming from those medallions will testify to their identity,
ensuring that we won’t get into accidental fights against our
fellows without realizing it,” Daolord Grayvast said. “Now, no
Daolord will dare to act against you here in the Brightshore Kingdom.
As for World-level cultivators? I’m confident that you should be
able to easily defeat any World-level cultivators. Oh - here is a
star map of the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Grayvast handed
Ning a furled star map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it.
“Thank you, senior Grayvast. I’ll be leaving now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll see you in
the Sword Palace,” Daolord Grayvast said. “Be careful on your
journey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will.” Ning
immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Grayvast
watched as the sword-carrying white-robed youth flew away, then
turned to leave as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The astral island which
Ning had been on began to sink downwards into that dark abyss below.
As for the random legacy treasures which Ning had left behind, they
all scattered and began to fly towards the various other islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the legacy
treasures of the ninety-nine legacies would forever remain within the
Astral Islands.

Chapter 48 - Yet Another Mirrorsnow Painting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was an exceedingly large place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clouds fluttered about
in the skies as a shuttle flew at high speed through the air. Ji Ning
was seated in the lotus position aboard his ship, staring at the
beautiful world of the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the Astral
Islands were over there. As for the Sword Palace, that’s over
there. And oh, that’s where they greet newcomers? So that’s the
place I was taken to when I was first abducted.” Ning now had a
rough understanding of the geography of the Brightshore Kingdom. “I
remember when I first arrived here and more than thirty thousand
fellow World-level cultivators were led by those two silver-armored
Daolords all the way to the Astral Islands. We flew for roughly
forty-six days. On the eleventh day, I could sense the presence of
another Mirrorsnow Painting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Teleportation was
impossible within the borders of the Brightshore Kingdom. One would
have to slowly fly from destination to destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To go from the
arrival area to the Astral Islands…” Ning engaged in a bit of
calculation and was able to easily calculate the rough location of
the Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two
silver-armored Daolords had flown in a straight line, and the
painting was roughly a quarter of the distance between the arrival
area and the Astral Islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? The Mirrorsnow
Painting isn’t that far away from Youji’s position. I won’t
have to make as much of a detour as I thought.” Ning was quite
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! His flying
vessel transformed into a streak of light and sped off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had given Su Youji
a message talisman. Due to the great distance which separated them,
he was only able to get a rough sense of the direction where she was
located. He flew for three full months, and on the way he sensed the
auras of quite a few Daolords. Those Daolords could sense that Ning
belonged to the Twelve Palaces and so they naturally had no interest
in causing trouble for Ning. Still, this journey gave Ning a good
understanding of how dangerous the Brightshore Kingdom was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was ambushed
multiple times on his trip. Clearly, the Brightshore Kingdom was a
rather chaotic and brutal place. There was even more strife here than
there was in the territory controlled by the Dao Alliance.
Unfortunately for those poor bandits who attempted to waylay Ning,
they quickly discovered that they had kicked a metal plate! The
results of their attempts were foregone conclusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? A ripple!” The
flying vessel quickly began to slow down and descend from its
position within the clouds. The white-robed Ning was seated in the
lotus position, a sword across his lap. Ning opened his eyes, a look
of eagerness in his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ripple is
coming from the Mirrorsnow Painting!” Ning could sense the
resonance being generated by his own three Mirrorsnow Paintings. “I
didn’t expect that after a thousand years, that painting would
still remain in this location.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep underneath a lake
that was located a ten billion kilometers away from Ning. There was a
beautiful palace located here in the depths, filled with many maids
and guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Within a side
hall of this palace was an azure-scaled creature who was leaning
against a throne while sipping some wine. The creature’s face
suddenly tightened ,causing the maid who had been giving him a neck
massage to be badly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Mirrorsnow
Painting? Wait, three of them?” The azure-scaled creature was both
shocked and delighted… but then, his face tightened once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand years ago,
when Ning had passed by this place after being abducted, this
creature had already sensed the presence of those paintings. He was
in possession of a copy, allowing him to sense the presence of three
other copies. He had been quite delighted, but as soon as he saw
those two silver-armored Daolords who ignored him he had immediately
realized that it was most likely an abducted World-level cultivator
who was in possession of the paintings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are the same
three copies I sensed last time. Did one of those World-level
cultivators escape from the Astral Islands already?” The
azure-scaled creature narrowed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He transformed
into a streak of light, almost instantly emerging from his aquatic
palace. He soon emerged from the lake, lifting his head up out of the
water to stare upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Following the
resonance, he turned his rather dark and icy gaze to stare towards
that flying vessel that was ten billion kilometers away. He was able
to see the vessel quite clearly, as well as the white-robed youth
aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not a
Daolord. He’s just a World-level cultivator.” The azure-scaled
creature was immediately delighted. He guessed that this person had
most likely discovered him, and so he no longer hid his presence. He
immediately sent out his godsense, sweeping it out to a distance of
ten billion kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually by
himself? He’s the only one on his ship?” The azure-scaled
creature grew increasingly excited. “It makes sense. He came out of
the Astral Islands. Those people who leave the islands usually travel
by themselves; it is quite rare for them to move around in groups.
Even if he does have some subordinates in an estate-world treasure,
they probably aren’t that strong given the fact that they are
hiding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-scaled
creature let out a cold grin. “So you have three of the paintings
but you want mine as well? How greedy. This fellow seems quite
confident.” The azure-scaled creature slipped below the waves once
more, quickly returning to his underwater palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
azure-scaled creature returned to his palace, he headed straight
towards the main hall. He picked up an enormous thigh-bone and then
began to bang on a nearby drum with it. Boom! The drum emanated a
series of ripples that instantly spread throughout the entire hall.
One person after another began to emerge from locations throughout
the palace, and all of them possessed auras of tremendous power that
were at least as strong as the azure-scaled creature’s aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurekai.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurekai, why have
you suddenly summoned us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You even banged on
the royal dragon drum. What is this all about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a total of
twenty-six World-level experts appeared within the main hall. All of
them could be considered cultivators, but they were all cultivators
of various aquatic races. This was why they had placed their palace
within the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something wonderful
has happened.” The azure-skinned creature let out a loud laugh.
“Ten billion kilometers away, there is a World-level cultivator who
is flying towards us at high speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flying straight for
us? A World-level cultivator?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he suicidal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level experts
present were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-scaled
creature said hurriedly, “He’s from the Astral Islands. There’s
a bit of a grudge between the two of us.” He didn’t dare to admit
that it was due to the Mirrorsnow Paintings, because those paintings
were simply too valuable. Between the two of them, they held a total
of four Mirrorsnow Paintings… this was a fortune that would cause
even Daolords to grow desirous. If he admitted it, his ‘friends’
would probably start to bicker with him over the items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once won a
treasure off of him, but he had two sets of that treasure. These
treasures resonate with each other, which is why he has followed me
to this place,” the azure-scaled creature said. “He has an
incredibly high number of treasures. After we kill him… I don’t
want anything special, just those three paintings he holds. What do
you say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three paintings?”
The other World-level cultivators were instantly able to guess that
the three paintings were fairly valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His other treasures
won’t disappoint you either.” The azure-scaled creature frowned.
“He came from the Astral Islands, but he was merely on par with me
in strength. If the twenty-seven of us fight together, we can easily
kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he came from the
Astral Islands, he might’ve joined the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
The azure-scaled creature swept them with his gaze, then let out a
cold laugh. “I came from the Astral Islands. I know it better than
anyone else. Everyone who was directly admitted into the Twelve
Palaces was an absolute monster. Very few were allowed entrance! The
vast majority who escaped that place did so because they were lucky
enough to piece together a full legacy. That fellow is probably on
par with me at best! Even if we are unlucky enough to encounter
someone freakishly strong… no matter how much of a freak he is, he
can’t possibly fight the twenty-seven of us together. I’m telling
you, this genius had many treasures on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others instantly
grew excited and intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are the
twenty-seven Waterfiend Lords of the Royal Dragon Palace. There’s
no way we’d be afraid of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him and take
his treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-seven
Waterfiend Lords of the Royal Dragon Palace were incredibly famous in
this area. There were all members of aquatic races who had trained to
the World-level, but only those who had reached certain levels of
strength would be granted entry into this small squad. Within the
Brightshore Kingdom, the powerful sects were generally guarded by
Daolords, but most of them had rather strict rules. The Brightshore
Kingdom was filled with many dangers and many fortunes; to locate
good techniques or legacies wasn’t very hard here. Thus, many
unaffiliated World-level cultivators ended up joining into minor
groups to work together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Azurekai had
relied on his own power to escape the Astral Islands. Although he
didn’t enter the Twelve Palaces, he just missed the cutoff by a
tiny amount. He was the second most powerful individual in the
palace, which was why others came when he called.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That kid just
emerged from the Astral Islands. He has no idea about our Royal
Dragon Palace.” The azure-skinned man said hurriedly, “Everyone,
stay patient. Let’s wait here inside our palace. Our palace has
formations and restrictive spells protecting it; this will prevent
him from realizing how many of us are here. After he reaches the
outside of our palace, we’ll charge out and surround him. We won’t
even give him a chance to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are hiding in the
shadows while he is standing in the light. So what if he made it out
of the Astral Islands? We aren’t pushovers either!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A distance of ten
billion kilometers was fairly far. Ning had to fly for quite a few
hours before arriving outside the lake. Ning’s skill gave him
courage, and his godsense had revealed the Royal Dragon Palace below
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning put away
his flying vessel, then charged straight into the lake and flew
towards the palace. Soon, he reached the palace gates. He immediately
saw the guards and maids within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dared
to come to our Royal Dragon Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many paths lead
to life, but you had to choose the one that leads to death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, streaks of
light began to fly out from the Royal Dragon Palace. There were
twenty-seven streaks of light in total, and they simultaneously
released murderous auras as they joined together into a formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched
calmly. He murmured to himself, “Royal Dragon Palace, eh?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_49___The_Twenty_Seven_Wa"></A>
Chapter 49 - The Twenty-Seven Waterfiend Lords
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-seven
streaks of light came to a halt after surrounding Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at them.
The twenty-seven figures before him were all quite bizarre-looking.
These were all creatures that were born as members of aquatic races.
Although as World-level cultivators, they could now survive equally
well on dry land or in the void of space, they still had an innate
fondness for water. Ning similarly could live equally well in water
or on land, but he still preferred to dwell on land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s gaze
fell upon the azure-scaled creature’s form. He could sense that the
painting was being carried by that creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three paintings!”
The azure-scaled creature felt a surge of excitement in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone…” Ning
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, are you afraid
now? Too late!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-seven
Waterfiend Lords couldn’t be bothered to chat with Ning. They had
dominated this region for quite some time and were figures of renown.
They showed no mercy at all when attacking. They truly weren’t
worried about this World-level cultivator at all; they had never
encountered someone on their level who could withstand the
twenty-seven of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weakest of the
twenty-seven was a master-class World God, while the strongest was a
transcendent World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A black streak of
lightning thundered down towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A current of
freezing energy surged out to try and freeze Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! An enormous
web-shaped treasure swept out to capture Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss! A serpentine
rope-like treasure twirled out to bind Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-seven
cultivators instantly launched simultaneously attacks in a very
practiced manner. Generally speaking, most World-level cultivators
were only able to control two powerful treasures at the same time. A
situation like this was a testament to the old saying, strength in
numbers. A dazzling array of spells and treasures instantly swept out
towards Ning in a wave, seeking to drown him. As for the World Gods
amongst the twenty-seven, they charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rings of sword-light
began to spread outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
surrounded by rings of sword-light. Although the freezing current of
energy was able to freeze the waters of the lake as it reached out
towards Ning, it instantly shattered whenever it touched the
sword-light. As for the web treasures and the other treasures? They
were completely stopped by Ning’s sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How average.” Ning
couldn’t help but sigh to himself. When he had used his Unicorn’s
Domain had been able to withstand Bertulu, he had been under
tremendous pressure. But now that he was fighting these twenty-seven
Waterfiend Lords… he felt things were far too easy. He didn’t
even have to really focus on this fight; he instead simply activated
his domain, allowing his sword-intent to automatically defend against
the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nineteen of the
twenty-seven were World Gods. This was quite a powerful force, after
all. World God Azurekai had been able to leave the Astral Islands
without anyone helping him, and he had the power of a transcendent
World God, but he was merely the second most powerful figure in their
group. Only sufficiently powerful individuals would be admitted into
their ranks, and these nineteen World Gods were filled with
tremendous power, especially after being reinforced by their
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” A streak of
silver light shot out at tremendous speed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ning held a
single sword in his hands. He glanced sideways at the attack, then
executed a simple sword-stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword was even
faster and his attack was even more profound!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Unicorn’s Domain was based off the perfect fusion of the
‘Astral’ stance and the sixth stance of the [Nameless] sword-art,
the Unicorn’s Heart. The [Nameless] sword-art was a sword-art that
had been left behind by an Eternal Emperor, while the Astral stance
had been developed based on Violetjewel’s quintessence. Both were
incredibly high-level sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
silver-streak of light was shocked after this clash. Ning’s
sword-light had actually brushed him across the chest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver streak of
light retreated at tremendous speeds. The power of Ning’s strike
was simply too enormous, and he was simply too strong. With a boom,
the streak of light slammed into the distant walls of the Royal
Dragon Palace, causing the entire palace to tremble. The other
twenty-six Waterfiend Lords were all horrified, to say nothing of the
palace attendants and maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person Ning had
just sent flying was the leader of the group… World God Dragonking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonking
was a transcendent World God who was supported by a formation with
multiple other World Gods! How could he have been beaten in just a
single clash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This opponent is too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Waterfiend
Lords all felt their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t fight him
solo. Let’s all fight together.” Although World God Azurekai was
rather shocked at how terrifyingly strong this opponent was, the
allure of those three paintings was simply too great. He immediately
roared mentally, “Big brother Dragonking, let’s join forces!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright!” World
God Dragonking had a decent protective divine ability. Although he
had been knocked flying, he hadn’t suffered any significant
injuries. “His sword-arts are quite profound. None of us are a
match for him in solo combat. All of us need to fight together.
There’s no way he can take us all on at once. Find a chance to tie
him up and bind him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s all
join together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonking
quickly flew back to rejoin them. They were all much more somber now.
They either attacked with magic treasures from afar or cautiously
advanced en masse towards Ning. By now, even the most arrogant member
of their group, World God Dragonking, no longer dared to act brashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom’s territory really is rather lawless. Is this what the
almighty Hegemon desires?” Ning shook his head. He had been waylaid
and accosted multiple times on his trip to this place from the Astral
Islands. This time, these twenty-seven had attacked him without even
bothering to talk to him. From this, one could see how unruly this
kingdom was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison…
although there was also danger and combat within the territory of the
Dao Alliance, it was a far more peaceful place! The Dao Alliance
followed the principles of governance through inaction, but there was
a reason for it. Ninety-nine percent of the territory of the Endless
Territories was under the control of the Dao Alliance, and virtually
all cultivators were a member of the alliance. There were simply too
many cultivators! Even though they governed through inaction, they
were still able to produce a few Daolords within each territory. How
vast and powerful was the entire Dao Alliance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main weakness of
the Dao Alliance was that its cultivators were too scattered out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s power was much more concentrated, even though it held
much less territory. The almighty Hegemon was a Brightshore Imperial,
which meant he really didn’t feel much pity or sympathy for ‘alien’
forms of life. He would use whatever means were effective in rearing
a crop of powerful experts! The fatality rate in the Astral Islands
was a testament to how cold and ruthless the almighty Hegemon could
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the Twelve
Palaces, the reason they existed and the reason the Hegemon had
created the Brightshore Kingdom was so that Imperials would be
protected. Because the Twelve Palaces had become extremely powerful,
the almighty Hegemon respected them and placed them on an equal
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Crack! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many weapons and spells
flew towards Ning in a steady stream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments ago, Ning had
been able to rely on his supreme sword-arts to easily defeat his
opponent. However, simply relying on sword-arts was no longer enough.
He would now have to actually fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nineteen World Gods
were all sent flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
flashed as the tip of Ning’s sword pierced into the body of World
God Dragonking, the fastest of the twenty-seven. This time, Ning
infused his strike with the power of his azureflower mist energy.
Although the strike had to first pass through a layer of armor, and
although World God Dragonking’s body was comparable to a Chaos
treasure… his body began to tremble, then crack apart as blood
began to flow from every single part of his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning showed
no mercy at all as he delivered three consecutive furious strikes
upon the body of World God Dragonking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” World God
Dragonking was utterly horrified. “How can he be this strong? He’s
clearly just at the World level. How can he be this much stronger
than me?!” The three consecutive blows smashed World God
Dragonking’s body into dust, causing even his truesoul to
dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can a
World-level cultivator be this strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too strong!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterfiend Lords
began to flee in utter terror. Even when they joined forces, they
were still defeated in the very first clash? But of course, if they
knew that Kilostar’s thousand clones weren’t able to do anything
against Ji Ning, they would no longer be surprised by their defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a freak! He’s
one of those horrifyingly, freakishly talented geniuses that were in
the higher strata of the Astral Islands. He must’ve been admitted
into the Twelve Palaces already!” The fleeing World God Azurekai
was more frightened than anyone else. “And he must’ve been one of
the top freaks!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of those ‘freaks’
were strong because of special treasures or secret arts, while others
held enormous advantages in terms of speed and strength. Those
freakishly strong cultivators who were as strong and fast as Daolords
of the First Step were the most terrifying ones of all. Kilostar and
Ning both belonged to this category. Even when Ning’s sword-arts
had been weak, his powerful divine body had allowed him to stably
reside within the fifth stratum. Once his sword-arts improved, he
became strong enough that even Bertulu would have to reveal his true
form in order to be certain of victory over Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” After
slaying World God Dragonking, Ning’s body flickered as he began to
chase after World God Azurekai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Azurekai and
World God Dragonking were both transcendent World Gods and the
strongest members of the twenty-seven. As for the others? Ning really
didn’t care about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Sword-light
descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” World God
Azurekai struggled to defend, utterly terrified. But after a few
strokes of sword-light, he was finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
acquired something like the [Golden Idol] out of pure luck. In
contrast, World God Azurekai had only been able to train his body to
make it comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure. He
hadn’t even reached the Chaos treasure level. Protective divine
abilities were very rare, after all, and they were extremely hard to
train in. Elite protective divine abilities were even more rare!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, World God
Azurekai disappeared into a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
treasures he had left behind, then waved his hand and collected it
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
Waterfiend Lords, they had all fled long ago. They didn’t even want
their palace any longer. As for the attendants and maids inside the
palace, they had hidden themselves in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
soared into the skies, shooting out of the lake and into his flying
vessel as he departed. Once he entered his vessel, Ning began to bind
the treasures which World God Azurekai had left behind. Soon, he
located the Mirrorsnow Painting he was looking for.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying shuttle flew
through the clouds with Ji Ning seated on the deck, going through the
treasures he had just acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is actually…”
Ning stared at the Mirrorsnow Painting in his hands. This painting
was a painting of a beautiful palace. This palace was slightly
different from the painting of a palace which Ning had already
acquired, but Ning immediately recognized it as being painted by
Emperor Mirrorsnow… partially because of how ugly it was, but also
because no one could imitate his distinct sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A painting of a
palace? Is this another copy of the first painting?” Ning nodded
slowly. “It makes sense. I would have to have stupid good luck in
order to find the fourth painting right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t too
surprised by the fact that this painting wasn’t the fourth
painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still… at least
this painting can be sold for roughly a hundred or two hundred
thousand cubes of chaos nectar. In fact, someone who desperately
needs it would probably be willing to pay even more.” Ning was in
quite a good mood. These paintings were popular, valuable items.
Generally speaking, those who acquired the paintings wouldn’t
divulge it to others! Given that there were only forty of them in all
the Endless Territories, and given that some might have multiple
copies of each…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It certainly wasn’t
going to be easy for him to just randomly encounter the exact piece
he needed. For him to even find a copy of the first one here in the
Brightshore Kingdom was already a stroke of great luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I go to the
Palace of the Sword, I’ll ask the Twelve Palaces to help me locate
the fourth painting,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces of
the Brightshore Kingdom were on the same general level of power as
the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, Ning had
asked Daolord Badlands to help him buy Mirrorsnow Paintings, and
Daolord Badlands had sought out the Dao Alliance to carry out this
task. Because they were on a tight time schedule, the Dao Alliance
didn’t really carry a large-scale search. The Twelve Palaces,
however, was itself an incredibly powerful organization that held
cultivators, Aeonians, and other special lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, Ji Ning
would be one of their links to the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, Gorho
would be one of their links to the Aeonians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, the Twelve
Palaces of Brightshore were on very good terms with many of the
organizations of the Endless Territories. It might be hard for the
Twelve Palaces to immediately procure a copy of the fourth Mirrorsnow
Painting, but if they were given enough time they stood an extremely
good chance of succeeding. But of course… that was only if you were
willing to pay the price!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent out a strand
of his divine power into his new copy of the first painting, creating
a divine clone within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace
inside the painting. A golden-robed emperor manifested atop the royal
throne within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed upon seeing
this. “Although there are slight differences, I can sense that he
is similar to the golden-robed emperor within my original first
painting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. A while ago, it
was World God Azurekai who met with me. Did you kill Azurekai?” The
golden-robed emperor looked downwards at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I already acquired other Mirrorsnow Paintings in the past. Do all
ten copies of the first Mirrorsnow Painting created by Emperor
Mirrorsnow hold the exact same ‘type’ of person?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They do.” The
golden-robed emperor smiled and nodded. He didn’t really care about
Azurekai’s death. He existed for the sake of completing the Eternal
Emperor’s mission, and for someone to be able to kill Azurekai
meant that this person should be even stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s have a
little competition,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurekai was never
able to defeat me.” The golden-robed emperor produced a golden
greatsword in his hands as he walked down the stairs towards Ning.
“You said you already have other Mirrorsnow Paintings. You should
know the rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know them.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a brief battle,
Ning defeated the golden-robed emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the flying
vessel, the true Ning revealed a look of resignation. “Although
there are slight differences in the sword-arts they use, the two
golden-robed emperors really do belong to the exact same ‘school’.
This is of no use to my sword-arts whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What else is there?”
Ning began to go through the rest of his spoils of war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Azurekai
didn’t have any particularly good treasures aside from the
painting. He did have an azure sword which was an Eternal weapon, but
Ning was quickly able to judge that it was merely a low-grade Eternal
weapon that was actually weaker than his Violetjewels! And there was
only one Eternal weapon. As for the other treasures, they were
negligible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He did have two
decent techniques.” Ning glanced through them. “Useless to me,
but I can transmit them to the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what World
God Dragonking had?” Ning scanned through these treasures as well.
World God Dragonking was a spear-wielder, but his spear was also
merely a low-grade Eternal treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was a place filled with many dangers but also many treasures and
legacies. So long as you were willing to brave the dangers, you would
have a good chance of acquiring powerful treasures and legacies. Some
of the more powerful World-level cultivators were thus able to
acquire Eternal weapons, but most of those weapons were merely
low-grade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The almighty
Hegemony is such a cheapskate. I bet most of the Eternal weapons he
scattered throughout the Brightshore Kingdom are just low-grade,”
Ning muttered to himself. “The Dao Alliance is better. In the rest
of the Endless Territories, Eternal weapons are quite rare and hard
to obtain, but the ones that you do find are usually pretty good. In
fact, some ruins might even hold top-grade Eternal weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ruins and relic
sites of the Endless Territories were generally left behind by
Daolords. It was only natural that they would hold excellent
treasures. The equivalent places in the Brightshore Kingdom, however,
were intentionally created by the almighty Hegemon! As a result,
almost all of the treasures were ‘mere’ low-grade Eternal weapons
at best.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” A jade bottle
suddenly appeared in Ning’s hands, causing him to reveal a look of
surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pureloop jade
bottle? And it holds a Bloodfire Cloudfruit inside?” Ning willed
the stopper of the bottle to pop out, allowing a fruit to emerge from
within the bottle. This was a fruit that was completely crimson in
color, and mist could be seen swirling in the air around it. Ning had
noticed this bottle earlier in his estate-world when he had quickly
scanned through World God Dragonking’s treasures, but only now did
he realize what a treasure it was and what it held inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pureloop jade
bottles can contain vast worlds within them. The vast world inside
this one can form a mighty Pureloop Jade Formation that will draw
upon all the chaos energy of that entire vast world, distilling it
into chaos nectar.” Ning sighed in amazement. This pureloop jade
bottle was far better at distilling chaos nectar than the
prisonworlds created by World God Pangaea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pureloop jade
bottle was able to distill a full cube of chaos nectar every chaos
cycle. Still… even Daolords had finite lifespans. With each step
they took, they walked the boundaries between life and death. Some
would perish after living for a mere thousand chaos cycles. Thus,
these bottles generally weren’t sold for too high a price. Most
were collected by sects and would be sold for roughly ten thousand
cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from being used
to distill chaos nectar, the bottle could also be used to hold some
of the marvelous items that were birthed from the primordial chaos.
There were certain treasures such as fruits or spirit-leaves that
would quickly lose their efficacy if not stored in a proper manner.
If you placed them within the heart of a Pureloop Jade Formation, the
formation would be able to prevent any leakage at all. This formation
was able to hold any type of energy, making it quite suitable for
storing treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually held a
Bloodfire Cloudfruit within it.” Ning mumbled to himself, “Did
this guy even know how valuable this thing is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had gained much
information from Daolord Solesky, which was why he knew about more
than 90% of the known treasures which existed in the Endless
Territories. World God Dragonking hadn’t been given a similar
legacy, and it really was possible that he didn’t know what a
Bloodfire Cloudfruit was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfire Cloudfruit
is incredibly valuable. These fruits are naturally born from the
primordial chaos and are extremely few in number. A single cloudfruit
can completely transform the divine body of a cultivator, converting
it into a divine body that is completely formed from the element of
fire. With this new body, the cultivator will find that training in
the Dao of Fire will be much easier than it was before. He will also
be able to merge and release Bloodfire, then use it to fly.” Ning
was truly quite amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, for example, was
able to control his [Novessence Thunder] and even had possession of
Dao lightning, but there was no way for him to fully merge into those
types of lightning. This was because there was simply no way for his
body to connect with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crows were
able to ride Golden Solarfire because their divine bodies were able
to perfectly join together with that fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod was unable to fly using Ninehorn Lightning Serpents
because his divine body was unable to perfectly join together with
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had lost quite a
few clones in order to transform his divine body, making it
thunder-aligned and capable of using the lightning serpents to fly.
However, Ninehorn Lightning Serpents were ranked as a type of Elder
lightning. They weren’t even at the Chaos level! There was
naturally no way for Ning’s body to take control over Chaos
lightning and use it to fly. If there was, Ning would be moving at a
truly astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Bloodfire
Cloudfruits were suitable for controlling Bloodfire, a type of Chaos
fire. If you used it to flee, the vast majority of Daolords would be
unable to catch up to you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This single fruit was
worthy roughly a million cubes of chaos nectar… and it generally
could not be found in the open market. These types of treasures that
were born from the primordial chaos were incredibly rare, unlike
Eternal weapons which could be forged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps this
World God Dragonking did know, but was afraid to reveal it?” Ning
mused. “Did he know? Or didn’t he? Still, it doesn’t matter.
This fruit is useless to me. If I encounter any treasures that I
need, I can sell it off or trade it.” Ning was in no rush to sell
it. This was a fine treasure for a Daolord who walked the Dao of
Fire. If he waited for an opportune time, he would be able to sell it
for a very high price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really didn’t
expect to be waylaid so many times after leaving the Astral Islands.
I killed quite a few of those bandits, but unexpected my most
valuable loot was this Bloodfire Cloudfruit rather than the
Mirrorsnow Painting.” Ning hurriedly stored the fruit back into the
pureloop jade bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
had quite a few valuable treasures on him already, and so he was
quickly able to return to his usual calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving the Royal
Dragon Palace, Ning flew for more than two more months before finally
reaching the place where Su Youji had secreted herself.

Chapter 51 - Bluegrace Sect
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bluegrace Sect was
one of the many sects within the enormous territory ruled over by the
Brightshore Kingdom. It had been established by Daolord Bluegrace and
was an ancient organization with deep roots.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke branch of
the Bluegrace Sect. The residential area for high-level sect members.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an estate
located at the peak of one of these mountains, and outside this
estate sat eighteen World-level cultivators in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A
white-robed woman at the entrance to the estate glanced at those
eighteen, then let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Qingfan, you should urge the Flamefairy Su Youji to
stop resisting.” A black-robed elder, one of the eighteen seated
World-level cultivators, spoke out. “Have her obediently hand over
her golems, her bugbeast, and that statue of Feixian the Exalted. If
she does that, we naturally won’t cause any further trouble for
her. Otherwise… once the order comes from the headquarters, she
shall perish and her Dao shall vanish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister Youji
rescued some of our fellow disciples. Not only have you shown no
gratitude, you’ve plotted against her and tried to take her
treasures away from her. Little sister Youji risked her life in order
to acquire that statue of Feixian the Exalted.” The white-robed
woman said angrily, “An order from the headquarters? You might be
able to cause trouble here in this local branch, but the main base
isn’t a place where you fools can do as you please!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
World-level cultivators no longer spoke. They just continued their
silent vigil.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
white-robed woman angrily returned to the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was seated in
the lotus position within one of the rooms in the estate, engaging in
silent meditation. Dressed in fiery robes, Su Youji emanated an aura
of incredible allure and magnetism . It was as though she was the
most beautiful, most seductive woman who had ever been born, so
beautiful that even World-level cultivators would be affected by her
presence. Suddenly, she opened her eyes. When she did so, she
withdrew her aura of magnetism. She glanced outside, then smiled.
“Elder sister Qingfan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Youji.” The white-robed woman walked into the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry to have
caused you trouble, elder sister Qingfan,” Su Youji said. “I put
you in a precarious situation here in your sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. This
is my estate. World-level cultivators are barred from barging into
the residences of their fellow disciples. They’ll only be able to
enter if they receive a command from the sectlord to do so,” the
white-robed woman said. “So long as you are in my estate, they will
be completely unable to get their hands on you. As for the sectlord,
he’s a figure of incredible power. If they think they can convince
him to issue an order… hmph. Hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji couldn’t
help but sigh silently to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire affair…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After she left the
Astral Islands, she had quickly realized how chaotic and unruly the
Brightshore Kingdom was. She had acted with great caution, first
purchasing a star map and getting an understanding of the Brightshore
Kingdom’s rough geography. Her goal was to go to the Palace of Fire
and test her luck, but midway on her journey she accidentally entered
a strange, dangerous location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many such
locations within the Brightshore Kingdom. Some had been personally
crafted by the almighty Hegemon, but some were left behind by
deceased Daolords. There were many dangerous locations which were
undiscovered and unknown to most cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji ended up
entering a dangerous region which had been set up by Feixian the
Exalted. She encountered many dangers in that place, and eventually
she found herself in a dangerous situation but was rescued by Fairy
Qingfan’s group. To be specific, it was Fairy Qingfan herself who
had rescued her. Su Youji felt very grateful towards her, and so she
had joined Fairy Qingfan’s group of three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had braved the
dangers of that place together, and Su Youji had put her golems and
bugbeasts into full effect. In the end… she actually passed the
trial which Feixian the Exalted had laid down, becoming her personal
disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feixian the Exalted had
left behind many treasures, all of which now belonged to Su Youji.
The rest of his treasures had been located within an estate-world
which Su Youji had easily taken away without notice, but his statue
had been located at the very highest position within the palace. Su
Youji had to personally climb up to grab it, and this was witnessed
by Fairy Qingfan and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan’s group
had experienced many life-and-death battles alongside Su Youji. They
all trusted each other very much, and Fairy Qingfan had even saved Su
Youji’s life. Thus, Su Youji didn’t harbor any suspicions
regarding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, Fairy
Qingfan had said to her, “Little sister Youji, you are heading to
the Twelve Palaces? That’s in the same direction as we are headed.
We are going back to our Eastsmoke branch. Let’s travel together!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and Fairy
Qingfan had quickly become fast friends and had grown close to each
other, and so they continued to travel together after exiting the
trials.. Fairy Qingfan had grown up here in the Brightshore Kingdom
and so was quite familiar with the local region. They arrived at the
Eastsmoke branch without any trouble… but right after they had sat
down and drank two cups of wine within Fairy Qingfan’s residence,
these World-level cultivators had immediately shown up and surrounded
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As it turned out, one
of the other companions on their journey, World God Whiteswan, had
reported on the outcome of their adventures to the branch leader of
the Eastsmoke branch. The Eastsmoke branch leader was merely a
World-level cultivator, and he grew greedy for Su Youji’s bugbeasts
and golems. Since Su Youji wasn’t a member of this sect, he
immediately issued an order to kill her and take her treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
little sister. He’s just a branch leader. As far as status goes, he
isn’t significantly superior to me. He just has a few connections
in the main base, which was why he was given the position of branch
leader. Without the sectlord’s orders, there’s not a damn thing
he can do. You can stay here for as long as you wish, little sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel had
just appeared in the clouds high above the Bluegrace Sect. A
white-robed youth was seated in the lotus position on the decks of
the vessel, a sword across his lap. The youth glanced downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My message-talisman
is directly below. Based on the star map which Daolord Grayvast gave
me, this place should be one of the nine branches of the Bluegrace
Sect.” Ning was rather puzzled. “Why did Youji come to the
Bluegrace Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bluegrace Sect had
been established by Daolord Bluegrace. The entire sect had a total of
four Daolords! Daolord Bluegrace was an extremely powerful figure,
but the other three Daolords were a bit weaker; they were merely
black-armored Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords of the
Twelve Palaces were divided up into several different levels of
power. There were black-armored, azure-armored, silver-armored, and
gold-armored Daolords. The black-armored Daolords were the lowest
level Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No ripples?” Ning
stared downwards at the Eastsmoke branch. “There are no Daolords
protecting this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense. There
were only four Daolords, while the Bluegrace Sect had a total of nine
branches. According to what Ning’s star map claimed, the four
Daolords usually resided in the main base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji is in the
Eastsmoke branch…” Although Ning was puzzled, he still put away
his flying vessel then began to fly downwards in person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite impressive.”
Ning stared downwards at the Eastsmoke branch. The Eastsmoke branch
covered an extremely vast territory of over ten million kilometers.
“According to this star map, this branch holds a total of more than
three hundred World-level cultivators. The Brightshore Kingdom really
is quite unlike the Dao Alliance. The sects of the Dao Alliance are
all extremely cautious when they recruit new World-level cultivators,
keeping their numbers low. Here, it seems their motto is ‘the more
the merrier’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance
governed through inaction. The Badlands Court was a good example.
Daolord Badlands was the leader of the Court and the entire
territory, but he only had roughly a hundred World-level cultivators
under his command. The vast Badlands Territory had more than ten
thousand World-level cultivators, but they were all scattered across
many smaller organizations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was different. The Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom and the
organizations they established, such as the Bluegrace Sect,
centralized things far more. The main base and nine branches of the
Bluegrace Sect alone held more than five thousand World-level
cultivators! They really did believe in the concept of strength in
numbers. This was because the Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom
were all prevented from fighting amongst each other, due to all of
them being members of the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since Daolords were
unable to directly do battle, battles amongst sects in the
Brightshore Kingdom had to be carried out by World-level cultivators.
Thus, the more the merrier! The battles amongst World-level
cultivators were quite brutal and savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt, fellow Daoist!
This place is the Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace Sect.” A tall,
skinny World-level cultivator flew out and shouted at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.”
Ning smiled. “I’ve come to join the Bluegrace Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, you
wish to join our Bluegrace Sect?” The tall, skinny cultivator gave
Ning a weighing glance. World-level cultivators were generally
mid-level figures within the Brightshore Kingdom. If Ning was an
Elder God, he wouldn’t be treated in such a friendly manner. “Haha,
the doors of our Bluegrace Sect are always open and welcome. Fellow
Daoist, please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
followed the man inside, moving past the protective formations and
entering the sect itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
branches of the Bluegrace Sect. The formations protecting it had
naturally been laid down by Daolord Bluegrace himself. Although the
formations weren’t that strong when being controlled by a group of
World-level cultivators, Ning wasn’t certain that he would be able
to overcome it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please follow me,
fellow Daoist.” The tall, skinny World-level cultivator flew
alongside Ning. The branch was more than ten million kilometers in
size, quite large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
over there?” Ning pointed off into the distance, towards the
direction where he could sense Su Youji was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sect has
disciples of varying levels of strength. The stronger World-level
cultivators reside in that area.” The tall, skinny World-level
cultivator pointed while speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning now
understood. Suddenly, he stretched out his palm, making it expand in
size to become dozens of meters long. He immediately grabbed onto
that World God as easily as he would grab onto a mouse. This person
was responsible for welcoming and greeting guests, but he merely had
the power of an elite World God. In the face of Ning’s power, he
wasn’t even able to struggle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist!”
The man was utterly terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wanted your
life, I could take it in an instant. If you want to stay alive, don’t
fight me,” Ning sent mentally. Then, with a whoosh, he transferred
the man into his own estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into a
streak of light, flying towards Su Youji’s residence at high speed.

Chapter 52 - A New Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning flew through
the air towards the region where he sensed Su Youji was residing. She
was within an estate at the very peak of a mountain, and there were
eighteen f igures seated in the lotus position in front of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are eighteen
World-level cultivators keeping watch over this estate?” Ning
muttered softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivator Ning had
captured stared at the white-robed Ning in terror. “Senior, please
spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Smart kid. Answer
all of my questions accurately. There exists no grudge between the
two of us. Unless absolutely necessary, I won’t kill you,” Ning
said calmly. He had created this clone using half of his divine
power, and his clone would be easily capable of slaying this
cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
tall, skinny World-level cultivator nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke. He
had been captured so quickly that he didn’t even have a chance to
fight back. He knew exactly how great the disparity between their
power levels was. In fact, he even suspected that this white-robed
youth might actually be a Daolord in disguise. Now that he was
trapped in this estate-world, how could he dare to be disobedient?
Wisdom lay in knowing when to resist and when to comply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you this.”
Ning pointed at the air next to him with a finger, causing a map of
the Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace Sect to appear. This map
included the estate at the top of the mountain, as well as the
eighteen World-level cultivators seated in the lotus position before
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who resides within
this estate?” Ning pointed at the estate at the top of the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the estate
of senior apprentice-sister Qingfan,” the captured cultivator said
hurriedly. “Senior apprentice-sister Qingfan is extremely strong,
and she has the power of a supreme World God. She ranks as one of the
top ten cultivators here in the Eastsmoke branch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
pointed and asked, “Why are there eighteen World-level cultivators
in front of her estate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, are you
friends with senior apprentice-sister Qingfan?” The captured
cultivator suddenly asked in a soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Answer me.” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan is in a lot of trouble right now. That’s
why her estate is under watch.” The captured cultivator said
hurriedly, “When she was out adventuring with two other fellow
disciples, she became friends with an outsider known as the
Flamefairy. The two of them are very close to each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sharp light flickered
through Ning’s eyes. Flamefairy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that they
met each other and helped rescue each other in a dangerous ruins whch
had been left behind by Feixian the Exalted. They experienced many
dangers together, and in the end this Flamefairy acquired the statue
of Feixian the Exalted,” the captured cultivator said. “Afterwards,
the Flamefairy accompanied senior apprentice-sister Qingfan to our
Eastsmoke branch…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captured cultivator
let out an awkward laugh. “And here, a few rather embarrassing
things happened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak!” Ning
barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-es! I’ll tell
you everything!” The captured cultivator said hurriedly, “One of
the two fellow disciples who went out alongside senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan, a World God known as Whiteswan,
immediately made a report to the branch leader once he returned to
the branch. My understanding is that our branch leader was interested
in this Flamefairy’s treasures and was planning to kill her and
take them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes narrowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing and looting
is very common here, and it is said that this Flamefairy has a set of
very powerful bugbeasts and golems, as well as that statue of Feixian
the Exalted. She might have other valuable treasures as well.” The
captured cultivator let out a sigh. “But who would’ve thought
that senior apprentice-sister Qingfan would notice that something was
off? She helped the Flamefairy fight back, then actually helped the
Flamefairy hide within her own estate. Now, the Flamefairy just hides
in there and refuses to leave no matter what.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captured cultivator
explained, “Our Bluegrace Sect forbids its disciples from barging
into the personal estates of our World-level cultivators. No one
would dare to violate this rule, unless they were doing so on the
orders of the sectlord himself. This is one of our laws. Thus,
there’s nothing our branch leader can do. All he can do is have his
loyal subordinates keep a close watch as he tries to come up with
some other ideas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our branch leader
wishes to kill the Flamefairy, whereas senior apprentice-sister
Qingfan wishes to protect her. As a result, senior apprentice-sister
Qingfan’s been living a rather unpleasant life recently. I hear
that she hasn’t left her estate at all.” The man secretly glanced
at Ning’s expressions. He was guessing that there had to be some
sort of a special connection between Ning and Qingfan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me ask you
something else. What type of protective formations does the Eastsmoke
branch have?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivator
immediately and obediently revealed everything he knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to fly
towards that distant estate, his mind filled with thoughts. He had
been able to easily enter this branch, but taking Su Youji out of it
would be no easy task. This was the Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace
Sect, after all. If all the protective formations here were
activated, things would become quite problematic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning began to
descend at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The eighteen
World-level cultivators seated before the estate all raised their
heads to look at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” One
of the black-robed elders said coldly, “I don’t believe I’ve
seen you before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.
Greetings, fellow Daoists.” Ning smiled. “I just recently joined
the Bluegrace Sect, and so I haven’t met with the vast majority of
our fellow disciples yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, a new arrival?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So a new junior
apprentice-brother has joined our ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These eighteen were
merely responsible for keeping a watch over this place. Aside from
the black-robed elder who was in charge of them, these cultivators
didn’t really have a great deal of status within the Eastsmoke
branch. Thus, they were all quite courteous when they met fellow
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In most schools, people
knew each other by their unique auras. Once you met someone, you
would be able to easily recognize that person in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Schools like the Twelve
Palaces had far too many members who were scattered throughout the
Endless Territories, which was why the almighty Hegemon had
personally crafted those identity medallions. It wasn’t easy to
create these medallions, all of which resonated with each other. The
Mirrorsnow Paintings had similar resonances as well. Even though
these weren’t particularly high-quality items, the cost of creating
each medallion wasn’t exactly cheap. The forging process was quite
complicated! The Bluegrace Sect had more than five thousand
World-level cultivators. It naturally wouldn’t outfit all of its
people with such treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen didn’t
suspect a thing. This was a central region in the Eastsmoke branch,
with hundreds of World-level cultivators present and a protective
formation which had been personally established by Daolord Bluegrace
himself. The formations here were all extremely complicated and
profound. Which World-level cultivator would dare to barge into this
place? Only a suicidal one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, why have you come here?” The black-robed elder
said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To meet with senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The faces of
all eighteen tightened slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of a
relationship is between you and her?” The black-robed elder asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan was my benefactor. To her, it was nothing
more than a bit of casual guidance, but I’ve never forgotten it.
Because of her, I decided to join the Bluegrace Sect after I became a
World God, all for the sake of repaying her kindness,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed elder
frowned as he looked at Ning, then instructed coldly, “Go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years, quite
a few people had come to visit Qingfan. However, no one had been able
to rescue the Flamefairy Su Youji from this gilded cage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan!” Ning walked to the entrance of the
estate, then called out, “Senior apprentice-sister Qingfan! Senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He called out multiple
times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Ning could
make out the vague form of a white-robed woman appear off in the
distance. The woman gracefully walked out of the estate, then looked
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sent
her a mental message. “If you want to save Youji, cooperate with
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan couldn’t
help but feel startled by this. The Eastsmoke branch wasn’t a large
place, and the story of the Flamefairy had quickly been made public.
However, there were very, very few people who knew that the
Flamefairy’s name was Su Youji. In addition, this sword-bearing
white-robed youth was someone who she had never met before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Qingfan, long ago you provided me with tutelage. I
finally have broken through to the World level and have joined the
Bluegrace Sect as well.” A look of gratefulness was on Ning’s
face. “Thank you for your guidance all those years ago, senior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just gave you a
few casual pointers.” A hint of a smile was on Fairy Qingfan’s
face. “I didn’t expect that the Elder God I guided would have
become a World God by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
World-level cultivators could hear their oral conversation. But of
course, there was no way they could eavesdrop on the mental one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?”
Fairy Qingfan sent mentally. “Hmph. You wish to help out Youji?
Hmph. These fools tried to use this method to cheat me before. Don’t
even dream about getting into my estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just help me tell
Youji one thing, and she’ll know who I am,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was seated in
the lotus position within her room. Everything was perfectly still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Youji.” Divine power flowed through the area, manifesting as a
clone of Fairy Qingfan. Her true form was still conversing with Ning
at the entrance, which was why she had manifested a clone here to
speak with Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, big
sister Qingfan?” Su Youji opened her eyes and looked puzzledly at
Fairy Qingfan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan asked
her, “Someone wishes to meet with you. Any idea who this person
is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? I don’t think
I know many people at all, here at the Eastsmoke branch.” Su Youji
was confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan looked at
her. “He said… his name is Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_53___Leave_It_To_Me"></A>
Chapter 53 - Leave It To Me
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s body
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His name was Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came for me?”
Su Youji’s mind was filled with many complex thoughts and feelings.
She felt a hint of excitement, but she also felt a hint of remorse!
She knew that this place was where the Eastmoke branch was
headquartered, and that it naturally was protected by many
restrictive spells. This was an extremely tightly guarded place.
Although Ji Ning was quite formidable, fighting in an enemy’s nest
was still an extremely problematic affair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had thought that Ji
Ning would spend a million years in the Astral Islands. She had
planned in quietly training in the legacy left behind by Daolord
Feixian the Exalted, as Feixian’s skills primarily lay in the
realms of charm, illusion, and control! She was a Daolord who was so
terrifyingly powerful that she was given the title of ‘the
Exalted’. Generally speaking, Daolords who were slightly weaker
than her would instantly fall under her control after a single
glance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was an individual
who was incredibly powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was born with
tremendous affinity for skills involving charm and allure. Even when
she had no legacies to guide her, she had been able to create a
charming technique of tremendous power. This was why she had been
able to pass all of the deadly trials left behind by Feixian the
Exalted, and in the end she was found to be qualified to become
Feixian’s personal disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My original plan had
been to train here for ten thousand years and reach the third stage
of the ‘Flying Immortal’ secret-art, then take control of the
eighteen World-level cultivators outside and leave stealthily.”
Even right now, Su Youji was capable of taking control over two or
three World-level cultivators at the same time. However, this sort of
mind control spell could only be maintained for a brief period of
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had never
attempted to leave by force. This was a branch headquarters of the
Bluegrace Sect; who would dare to try to force their way in or out of
a place like this? Her goal was to take control of those eighteen,
then leave stealthily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I let him
in?” Fairy Qingfan asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Su Youji
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Fairy
Qingfan looked at Su Youji and smiled. “You look so dazed and
befuddled right now. What sort of a relationship do you have with
him, exactly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji shook her
head. “What do you mean, ‘dazed and befuddled’? I’m his
retainer. He is my master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…?” Fairy
Qingfan was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the entrance to
Fairy Qingfan’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Fairy Qingfan
were continuing to chat here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For you to join the
Bluegrace Sect shows that karmic ties continue to bind us. Enter my
estate. Stay here for a while and have a good conversation with me.
As of late, your big sister’s been bored senseless.” Fairy
Qingfan tossed Ning an intentionally playful look. Now that she knew
that Ning was Su Youji’s master, she found herself quite impressed.
This white-robed youth was definitely an figure of extraordinary
power and ability. To have such an extraordinary figure address her
as ‘big sister’ was quite diverting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave her a look,
then chuckled. “Please lead the way, senior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Fairy Qingfan
turned and walked towards her estate, with Ning following behind her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
World-level cultivators seated outside all watched as this
transpired. When the black-robed elder saw Fairy Qingfan actively
invite Ning into the estate, a rather ugly look appeared on his face.
He barked coldly, “Junior apprentice-sister Qingfan, don’t try to
seduce this new junior apprentice-brother of ours into helping you
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of your damn
business.” Fairy Qingfan didn’t even turn back to look at him.
She simply let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, remember… there are some things which
you should do and some things which you should not do.” A chill
filled the voice of the black-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Su Youji had
already emerged from her room and was staring at the pathways in
front of her, waiting eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Fairy Qingfan
emerged from around the bends, and behind her was a white-robed youth
who bore a longsword on his back. The youth looked the same as he
always had, the same as he had in her memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Su
Youji stared at him, her heart filled with many emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guilt?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gratitude?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Astral Islands,
she had battled until she was at the point of absolute despair and
exhaustion. When she saw Ji Ning appear, she had actually wept. And
now, they were meeting at the Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace Sect.
Even for someone like Ji Ning, a fight here would be quite
troublesome. And yet… he had still come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is always you
helping me out, rather than vice versa. I’m your retainer, but I’ve
never been able to do anything for you.” In this instant, Su Youji
suddenly realized that she would never be able to forget how Ji Ning
had saved her from the Astral Islands. That moment had been indelibly
imprinted into her very soul… and now, they were meeting again here
at this branch of the Bluegrace Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” Ning
walked over towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
nodded slightly. “I’ve caused trouble for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that this
branch leader of the Eastsmoke branch is mainly trying to steal your
treasures. I also heard something about a statue of Feixian the
Exalted?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji looked at Ning
with some degree of surprise. “You already know?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to glance
at the nearby Fairy Qingfan. “Fairy Qingfan, if Youji wishes to
leave, who will try to stop her?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan could
instantly sense that this white-robed youth was now speaking in a
very different way and had a very different attitude. When they had
been at the entrance to her estate, he had modestly addressed her as
‘senior apprentice-sister Qingfan’. Although he still spoke in a
very relaxed way, his words and his demeanor revealed his absolute
self-confidence and his dominating presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If little sister
Youji wishes to leave, she would first need to deal with those
eighteen World-level cultivators standing guard,” Fairy Qingfan
said. “They are keeping a tight watch, and if anything happens they
will immediately make a report to that fool of a branch leader. When
that happens, that fool will undoubtedly order many of our other
World-level cultivators to attack. In fact, he might even activate
the many formations protecting this place. Once that happens, there
really will be nowhere to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
This was what he had expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, give me
another hundred thousand years and I might be able to work something
out,” Su youji said. A hundred thousand years would actually be
millions of years if she used a temporal acceleration treasure. That
should be more than enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If too much time
passes, new variables will enter the equation,” Ning said. “Since
this man was able to become the local branch leader, he probably has
certain connections within the main base. If he wants to barge into
the estate of a fellow disciple and seize an unaffiliated World-level
cultivator, all he has to do is find a suitable excuse and he’ll
probably be able to convince Daolord Bluegrace into agreeing. You’ve
only been here a few centuries, which is why he has been able to bide
his time. If you wait too long, that will no longer be the case.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s face
turned pale. Right. Once the local branch leader received permission
from the main base, he would be able to enter this estate and seize
her. By then, she would have no recourse at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me. I’ll
bring you out of here,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji felt a warm
feeling in her heart. Although she was worried about Ning, as his
retainer she held enormous faith in him. He was indeed an absolute
freak of nature!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” The nearby Fairy Qingfan said in a rather unhappy manner,
“You must not act rashly. If you remain inside, they’ll be
limited by the rules of the sect and won’t dare to cause trouble.
But if you were to take little sister Youji out of this place…
they’ll be allowed to attack. They won’t show mercy to an
outsider who isn’t a member of our sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Qingfan, all
you need to do is stand back and watch.” Ning turned his head and
said to Su Youji, “I’ll take you into my estate-world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan said
unhappily, “Little sister Youji, this isn’t…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just waved his
hand, drawing Su Youji into his estate-treasure. He then turned and
began to walk towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-!” Fairy
Qingfan immediately hurried after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrance to the
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning emerged from the
estate and saw the eighteen World-level cultivators seated outside of
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leaving already?”
The black-robed elder stared at Ning in a very solemn manner, as did
all of the other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did Fairy Qingfan
ask you to help her out by taking the Flamefairy out with you?” The
black-robed elder’s voice turned icy cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She did not,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, the Flamefairy’s matter has grave implications
for everyone here. As a result, we can’t just let you leave like
this.” A nearby red-haired child spoke in a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you plan on
inspecting my treasures?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivators often
hide many of their secrets in their treasures. We won’t insist on
inspecting everything by force. However… you will need to swear a
lifeblood oath that you are not taking the Flamefairy out of this
place.” The black-robed elder said calmly, “If you truly are not
carrying her with you, then this oath will have no impact on you at
all. But if you are… then this lifeblood oath will immediately
rebound upon you and devour your life. You’ll die on the spot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swear the lifeblood
oath and we will let you leave.” Swish! A dark-red crystalline rod
was sent flying towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
dark-red rod, then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, he manifested
three heads and six arms. His six arms dramatically increased in
size, and his palms became so large as to block out the skies as he
struck out towards the eighteen cultivators nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan was
standing right behind him, and her eyes immediately bulged out. He
actually went straight to fighting? How could Su Youji’s master be
such a fool? He actually dared to launch an attack within the
Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace Sect?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fool.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen
World-level cultivators instantly activated their formation, allowing
Immortal energy to pool together and then flow over their bodies. The
reason there were eighteen of them here was so that they could join
forces and fight against tough foes. Even if Su Youji tried to use
her bugbeasts and golems to force her way out of the estate, they
would be able to hold on against her for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the six enormous
palms swept towards them, an enormous collision could be heard as one
of the World-level cultivators was captured as easily as one might
pick up a little chick. The man was forcibly dragged into Ning’s
estate-treasure, the entire formation having been forcibly torn
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The six
enormous palms continued to howl forth and strike out towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
powerful?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining
World-level cultivators were all stupefied. This initial clash had
just resulted in Ning capturing eleven of them, and the rest
hurriedly began to scatter and flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the enormous
power ripples caused by this clash spread out to encompass the entire
Eastsmoke branch, which was merely ten million kilometers in size.
Every single World-level cultivator here was able to easily sense
that something had happened, and many streams of godsense swept
outwards towards this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dare you! How
dare you barge into our Bluegrace Sect!” One stream of godsense
carried a voice that exploded loudly within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Ning
suddenly poured out his own godsense, sweeping it in all four
directions in an all-encompassing wave. Thanks to the nurturing
effect of his azureflower mist energy, Ning’s soul was comparable
to that of a Daolord of the First Step, as was his godsense. Other
World-level cultivators truly had far weaker godsenses by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s godsense
flooded out, it boomed as it slammed into the streams of godsense
that had flooded this area. Ning’s godsense crushed everything in
its path, smashing apart nearly three hundred different streams of
godsense and chaosense. The difference between a World-level
cultivator and a Daolord was simply too apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment, the only
stream of godsense present within the ten million kilometer region of
the Eastsmoke Sect belonged to Ji Ning. All the others had been
completely crushed and wiped out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamefairy is my
retainer. Today, I’ve come to the Eastsmoke branch of the Bluegrace
Sect to take my retainer away from this place.” Ning’s voice
boomed out, echoing in every corner of the entire Eastsmoke branch.
“I trust that most of you know about the matter of your branch
leader seeking to steal my retainer’s treasures, and you all know
in your hearts who is in the right and who is in the wrong. I am
going to take my retainer out of this place, and I’d rather not
launch a massacre… but if anyone who seeks to bar my path shall
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice blasted out
across every inch of the local branch’s territory. Every single
World-level cultivator found his godsense or chaosense completely
suppressed, and they were all completely unable to push back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan stood
there at the entrance to her home, staring in amazement as this all
happened. When she heard this earth-shattering voice boom out in her
mind, she couldn’t help but be shocked once again!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_54___Launching_A_Massacr"></A>
Chapter 54 - Launching A Massacre
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan was
completely stunned by the dominating power of Ji Ning’s godsense.
The power of one’s godsense was derived from the strength of one’s
soul. This was something that simply couldn’t be faked! All by
himself, Ji Ning had crushed the godsenses of all the other
World-level cultivators in the Eastsmoke branch. This alone was proof
that he was a person who ordinary cultivators absolutely could not
compare to! And, judging from Ning’s words… he had only revealed
a tiny fraction of his true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” Although Fairy Qingfan was so stunned that she immediately
spoke and acted in a much more humble manner, she still said to Ning
frantically, “This place is the local headquarters of our Bluegrace
Sect. It is protected by many mighty formations which Daolord
Bluegrace personally set down! No matter how strong are you, you
can’t possibly withstand our guardian formations! You are acting
far too impetuously!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave her a glance.
“Fairy Qingfan, I already told you that you only need to do is
stand back and watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll do just
that.” Fairy Qingfan gritted her teeth. “Although that idiot
branch leader is a real imbecile, he won’t show any mercy in
activating those formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I really can’t
beat him, I’ll just hide in your estate again, Fairy.” Ning
tossed a smile her way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Fairy
Qingfan stared, dazed. Good point. Ji Ning was standing right at the
entrance to her estate. He really could simply retreat into it
whenever he wished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then turned to
stare at the distant main palace of the Eastsmoke branch, his gaze
turning cold. The choice of how to proceed was up to the local branch
leader. If he was wise enough to let Ning leave, Ning wouldn’t
pursue this matter any further and simply wipe the slate clean! It
was very common for cultivators to fight each other out of greed for
each other’s treasures, after all, and Su Youji hadn’t actually
been harmed. This matter was a matter that could be easily glossed
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if he chose to
fight…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outcome would be
completely different. Ning wasn’t certain in his ability to
overcome the local formations, and so he wouldn’t show any mercy at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Eastsmoke branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is he? Where the
hell did he come from?” The Eastsmoke leader was a fairly handsome
man, but his eyes were as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea where he’s
from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how powerful
his godsense is, he’s definitely an extraordinary World-level
cultivator. In fact, he might be strong enough to enter the Twelve
Palaces or might have already done so.” There were three other
World-level cultivators in the main hall. Usually the various
World-level cultivators of the Eastsmoke branch would reside within
their own residences, and so the main palace only had three on duty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader’s
face sank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Branch leader, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we activate
the formation and let them leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other three all
looked at their branch leader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
was considering this very question as well. “It seems as though the
master of the Flamefairy is quite a powerful figure… but no matter
what, he’s just one man! So what if he really is a member of the
Twelve Palaces? In this place, I can still kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
had long ago ordered all members of the Twelve Palaces to swear
lifeblood oaths, preventing them from killing each other. However,
these oaths were not binding upon the other cultivators of the
Brightshore Kingdom! Although World-level cultivators who had been
granted entry into the Twelve Palaces were generally incredibly
powerful, over the course of countless years there had been a few
occasions in which ordinary World-level cultivators had managed to
somehow kill World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces. When this
happened, the response was simple: Too bad! It was his own damn
fault!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you were protected
from Daolords but ended up being killed by World-level cultivators,
you deserved it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His retainer had so
many treasures. He has to have even more.” The Eastsmoke leader
grew more and more greedy as he thought about this. “No matter
what, he’s just a World-level cultivator. The sectlord once said
that not even the most powerful World-level cultivator would be able
to defeat these protective formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill. Kill him!”
The Eastsmoke leader made his decision, born of personal greed as
well as confidence in the protective formation’s power. Ning’s
own display of dominance and power had also angered the Eastsmoke
leader, contributing to this decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The Eastsmoke
leader sent out a strand of his will, merging it into the protective
formation that covered the entire Eastsmoke branch. This was a
sealing formation that prevented anyone from entering or leaving the
place. This formation was perpetually active, which was why Ning had
to pretend that he was interested in joining the Bluegrace Sect and
be granted entry. If he hadn’t, there would’ve been no way for
him to force his way inside. The sealing formation would’ve stopped
him dead in his tracks, and the many other formations would’ve
begun to launch spells against him as various World-level cultivators
took control over them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not only did you
barge into the Bluegrace Sect, you act with such arrogance. It seems
as though you truly have a death wish!” The Eastsmoke leader’s
mind had become one with the formation, and his voice boomed out
through the natural energy controlled by the formation as it echoed
throughout the region. “On my orders, all disciples of the sect are
to take control over our various formations and kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Giving this order
through godsense would’ve been more subtle, but Ning’s godsense
had completely permeated this entire region, giving him no option but
to send the order through his formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take control of the
formations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the World-level
cultivators were hesitating, as they all knew that the Eastsmoke
leader was in the wrong for lusting over the treasures of this man’s
retainer! In addition, the man’s godsense was so strong that he was
clearly an unfathomably powerful figure. Some of the vacillating
cultivators began to delay on purpose, wanting to see exactly how
powerful this mysterious expert was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, some of them
did obey the orders right away. As for the ones who were extremely
good friends with the Eastsmoke leader, they all began to fly
straight towards the various formation-cores. “Once we kill him,
we’ll split some of the spoils as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dared to enter
our base. He truly doesn’t know his own limits!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as they
rendered merits in battle, there would be no way that the Eastsmoke
leader would be able to refuse giving them a portion of the spoils.
World-level fellow disciples were fairly important and respected,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
front of Fairy Qingfan’s estate. When Ning heard the Eastsmoke
leader send out a booming order to kill him, he just slowly shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think of something,
quick!” Fairy Qingfan said desperately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formations… have
to be operated by cultivators,” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out!” A
crimson-black gourd instantly appeared in the air next to Ning. This
was the Elementum Waterflame Gourd, and it immediately unleashed two
dragon-like streaks of lightning. One was the Watersmoke Lightning,
which surged out like a dark stormclouds that was filled with
crashing waves of water. The other was the Firecloud Lightning, which
spread out like an enormous billowing cloud of flames. The two
streaks of lightning wrapped around each other, then began to blast
out in every direction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Chaos lightning moved faster than almost all Daolords. As for
Dao lightning, it moved with such terrifying speed that even Daolords
would be befuddled by it, to say nothing of World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao lightning
blasted out in every direction. In the blink of an eye, every part of
the ten million kilometers of the Eastsmoke branch became filled by
the Watersmoke Lightning and the Firecloud Lightning. These two
mighty types of Dao lightning were incompatible with each other, due
to being water-aligned and fire-aligned, and each time they clashed
with each other they would explode with utterly earth-shaking force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators who had
been the first to move, hoping to help kill Ning and then get a share
of his treasures, watched in utter despair as Dao lightning blanketed
the skies above them! The Dao lightning moved with such incredible
speed that they were filled with complete hopeless. It must be
remembered that Daolord Allgod himself had used those nine secret
arts including the [Novessence Thunder] to strike down Emperor
Melobo. In terms of speed alone, Dao lightning was generally so fast
that even Eternal Emperors were unable to dodge it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The two streaks
of Dao lightning slammed downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO-!” Some of the
World-level cultivators brandished their weapons, seeking to block.
Alas, as the divine lightning swept past them they were instantly
reduced to dust, their truesouls completely annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two mighty streaks
of Dao lightning were so powerful that when they were completely
focused on a single opponent, they would be able to slay even a
supreme World God with a single blow. Even transcendent World Gods
would suffer heavy injuries, and a few repeated strikes would result
in their deaths!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since Ning had
spread out his two streaks of Dao lightning into an area attack, the
power of the attack was somewhat lessened. The elite World Gods were
instantly swept through and destroyed! The master-class World Gods
would be able to survive for two breaths before also perishing. As
for supreme World Gods, they would generally be able to survive.
However, this small Eastsmoke branch only had a total of around three
hundred World-level cultivators. It only had roughly ten or so who
had reached the supreme World God level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The cultivators
who had been the first to respond to their leader’s orders and
charge forward began to die under the horrifying power of the two
types of Dao lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had only been a
single supreme World God who had responded to the Eastsmoke leader’s
orders right away, and Ning focused an enormous amount of lightning
on him, causing him to perish after a few breaths as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had only been ten
breaths worth of time, but all of the thirty-nine cultivators who had
acknowledged their branch leader’s orders had perished! As for
those who were hesitating or who were just watching, Ning didn’t
act against them yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I was
cautious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I
hate that idiot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many hesitating
World-level cultivators in the branch all raised their heads to stare
at the boundless streaks of Dao lightning filling the skies. The
black lightning and the blazing lightning were tangled together,
constantly crackling and exploding with such power that they all felt
chilled to the core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan stared in
a similarly stupefied manner at the endless lightning crackling in
the skies. She then turned to stare at the crimson-black gourd
hanging in the air next to Ning. The gourd was still emitting more
streaks of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said. Anyone
who seeks to bar my path shall die.’ Ning’s voice boomed out with
the thunder, shaking the heavens and the earth. “If you do not get
involved, I will not harm you. I do not harm the innocent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve killed the
disciples of our sect. You must die!” The Eastsmoke leader’s
furious voice echoed in the skies as well. “The nineteen of you who
are already in position, activate the formations right away and kill
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
had been driven absolutely furious. Normally, if an enemy attacked
they would be able to rely on the protective sealing formation to
defend them as the various World-level cultivators took control of
the various attacking formations and used them to surround and
assault their foe. The more powerful formations required multiple
World-level cultivators to use, and there was obviously no point in
having all of their cultivators be permanently stationed within the
various formations. They needed to train and to go out on adventure!
They would usually train in their own residences; all they had to do
was hurry out and take part in any battles that did arise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem was that Ji
Ning was already inside the formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even so, normal enemies
would not have been able to prevent them from entering their various
formation-cores. The problem was that Ning had the Elementum
Waterflame Gourd, allowing him to wipe out all of them at one ago.
Alas, nineteen World-level cultivators were permanently stationed in
some of the formation-cores at all times, and so some of the
formations were still activatable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the nineteen of
you do not get involved, I won’t act against you.” Ning’s voice
boomed out once more. “But if you try to stop me… I guarantee
that I will kill you all, no matter how much time and effort it
takes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the nineteen
World-level cultivators within the formation-cores began to hesitate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should they get
involved in this? If they didn’t get involved, they wouldn’t be
in any danger. But if they did get involved and were unable to kill
this mysterious expert, they would be in for a world of hurt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him! Later,
I’ll give all nineteen of you an equal share of his treasures.”
The Eastsmoke leader spoke out using his Immortal energy through his
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are inside our
formation. There’s no way he can touch us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him and his
treasures will be ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we act, we have
to make sure we get rid of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the
World-level cultivators chose not to get involved and instead just
watch, but the other sixteen elected to activate their formations out
of greed. Activating all the formations would require sixty
cultivators, and they were only sixteen of them in position. Only a
small part of the power of the formations had been unleashed, but
they still felt quite confident. They trusted in the might of Daolord
Bluegrace’s formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple formations
throughout the region began to activate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
stare into the skies, his eyes as cold as death.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 55 - The Formations Activate
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
was in charge of the most important formation. This was the one
preventing Ji Ning from leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
sixteen, they were able to control roughly eight other formations.
Three of them were meant for bewildering opponents while the other
five were meant for launching attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The enormous illusion of a axe slowly began to manifest in the air,
drawing upon more and more of the power of Heaven and Earth as it
corporealized. The illusion became increasingly solid, and its aura
continued to increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of this
divine axe is so great that even a hundred World Gods would be slain
by a single chop.” Fairy Qingfan had already hidden herself inside
the estate behind Ning, and she watched all this happen with concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunder rang out,
shaking both the heavens and the earth as streaks of lightning began
to appear. These were all streaks of Chaos lightning, but they were
so numerous that they still possessed tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An axe, lightning
bolts, flames, black mist, a divine sword… all five attacking
formations had been activated. The three bewildering formations also
began to unleash their power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. How
laughable.” Ning simply stood there. His soul was so strong and his
will was so resolute that all of the bewildering illusions were
useless against him. It must be understood that not even a Heartforce
Cultivator like Bertulu had been successful in using illusions to
deceive Ning, to say nothing of these formations. These formations
were designed to be used against World-level cultivators. They were
completely useless against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
the skies and let out a furious howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two mighty streaks
of Dao lightning immediately blasted out once more, striking towards
the enormous axe, the Chaos lightning, the flames, the black mist,
and the divine sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One explosion after
another could be heard as the Dao lightning began to battle the five
offensive formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first to be
destroyed was the Chaos lightning. Next was the strange, billowing
black mist, which was wiped out by the supremely yang-attribute,
forceful, and destructive Dao lightning. As for the giant greataxe
and the divine sword, they contained so much condensed power that not
even the Dao lightning could shake them! The destruction of the Chaos
lightning and the strange black fog had used up a tremendous amount
of the Dao lightnings’ power. In the end, it was only able to
slightly weaken the blazing, Fiendgod-shaped flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The blazing
Fiendgod flew through the air, roaring furiously as flames erupted in
its wake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
enormous greataxe hanging in the air quickly descended like a scythe,
chopping down towards Ning with fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The divine
sword hanging in the air descended tip-first as it stabbed straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die. Die! DIE!”
The Eastsmoke branch leader gritted his teeth as he watched from
within the main palace. He repeated the word ‘die’ over and over
again, hoping that when the power of these three formations descended
they would utterly annihilate this white-robed brat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to do. You
HAVE to die.” The sixteen World-level cultivators controlling the
formations watched eagerly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was forbidden for
members of the Twelve Palaces to fight amongst themselves, but
ordinary World-level cultivators often dreamed of having the chance
to slay a member of the Twelve Palaces! The status difference between
the two was as great as the difference between the heavens and the
earth, after all. However, the difference in power was similarly
great, and those who were capable of completing such a momentous task
were few and far between.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They now had a chance
to accomplish such a deed… and if they won, they would gain access
to this terrifyingly powerful World God’s treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…” Fairy
Qingfan raised her head to stare at the blazing Fiendgod, the
enormous greataxe, and the divine sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what will
happen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other World-level
cultivators who were simply watching on the sidelines stared as the
three weapons descended towards that tiny white-robed figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
suddenly let out an angry snort, instantly expanding in size to
become a three-headed, six-armed Fiendgod who was more than thirty
thousand meters tall. His six enormous palms were large enough to
blot out the skies, and he swept them towards the three attacking
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill!” The
blazing Fiendgod continued to bellow furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using the same
sword-art with all six of his palms - the Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This strike focused on
using raw strength and power to overwhelm and crush foes in a head-on
clash! After his experiences in the Astral Islands, Ning’s
[Brightmoon] sword-art had become dramatically more powerful as well.
They were now comparable to the sixth stance of the [Nameless]
sword-art! Ning’s Heavenbreaker stance now had a similar aura of
overwhelming dominance as the third stance of the [Quintessence
Sword-Intent], the Astral stance, but it was even more direct and
brutish in its might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! Two of the
mighty palms slammed into blazing Fiendgod in succession. The blazing
Fiendgod bellowed furiously as it attempted to fight back… but as
the two palms simultaneously collided with it, its body began to
break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Two enormous
palms slammed direct into the chopping greataxe in a frontal
collision. The result was the the greataxe was actually shaken into
pieces, causing it to dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final two palms
smashed straight towards that descending sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
Ning had transformed into a towering Fiendgod, manifested three heads
and six arms, then used his six palms to crush all three attacks.
This sight caused all of the World-level cultivators in the Eastsmoke
branch to fall silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I
didn’t get involved!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all stared
slack-jawed, especially Fairy Qingfan. She was completely dazed!
“Youji mainly relied on her bugbeasts and golems! She herself
wasn’t that powerful. When this Ji Ning guy took out one of those
legendary Elementum Waterflame Gourds, I thought that he had to be
just like Youji, someone who relied on magic treasures. I never
imagined that he himself is even more powerful than those treasures!
H-he… he must be close to a Daolord in might!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That blazing
Fiendgod, in terms of raw strength alone, was actually comparable to
a Daolord of the First Step. Unfortunately, its insights into the Dao
were so poor that it was even weaker than ordinary World-level
cultivators in this regard.” Ning couldn’t help but shake his
head. “As for that axe and the sword, they were materialized with
many profound mysteries and were actually quite strong.
Unfortunately, all the power they contained was used up after a
single strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weakness of the
blazing Fiendgod was that it possessed a very low level of insight
into the Dao. As for the greataxe and the divine sword, they had no
staying power. They were only able to stay materialized for a brief
period of time at their maximum level of power. Ning, however, was a
cultivator and was thus able to fight at maximum power for quite some
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All things crumble
before the face of my Heavenbreaker stance,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the fifth
stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art, the Heavenbreaker stance. This
was Ning’s most physically powerful attack, an attack relying on
overwhelming might! It was far more ferocious and forceful than the
Blood Drop stance or the Shadowless stance. However, the Blood Drop
stance had better penetration while the Shadowless stance was more
unpredictable. When Ning battled against powerful cultivators, he
generally tended to use some of the other stances, but when faced
with these fairly weak formations it was actually the Heavenbreaker
stance which was the most suitable attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do?!” The Eastsmoke leader began to freak out, his
eyes turning red with panic. “The formations can’t kill him. What
should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Branch leader, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How are supposed to
beat him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other sixteen
World-level cultivators in charge of those eight formations began to
panic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader’s
eyes were now bloodshot. Through his formation, he howled furiously,
“No need to be afraid! He must have used some sort of incredibly
powerful divine ability in order to be able to unleash such
tremendous might! The more powerful a divine ability is, the more
divine power it uses up. He’s probably using up divine power a
thousand times faster than he would in a ‘normal’ battle. There’s
no way he’ll be able to sustain this, but our formations will
ensure that we can continue to launch attacks without pause.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s kill him
through attrition.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way
he’ll be able to launch too many of those attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already made
an enemy out of Ji Ning. If they were to now let him leave…
unacceptable! The only choice was to follow this path to its
conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were using
formations, and so they were able to draw upon the endless amount of
natural energy that existed in the world. The formations were also
powered by chaos jewels, ensuring that the controllers didn’t have
to use up too much of their own Immortal energy. They’d be able to
keep fighting for an extended period of time. <BR> An illusion of an
axe, an illusion of a sword, a black mist, a flaming giant, and
lightning bolts once more began to form in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced upwards at
them, then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attrition?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each attack, the
formations would have to build up power for quite some time before
striking out. Ning himself was being reinforced by his azureflower
mist energy and actually wasn’t using much of his own normal power.
In a battle like this, the rate at which he absorbed energy from the
outside world was actually faster than the rate at which he used it
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning suddenly
stepped forward, transforming into a streak of light that flew
straight into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s moving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s flying
towards the main palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many World-level
cultivators were watching this fight nervously. They didn’t dare to
take part in this battle at all, because even if all of them joined
forces they would still be butchered by this white-robed youth! The
difference between a World-level cultivator and a Daolord of the
First Step was simply enormous. Ji Ning had a much lower level of
insight compared to a Daolord of the First Step prior to the almighty
Hegemon abducting him, but he was now on equal terms with an actual
Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew forwards,
he suffered yet another waves of attacks, but he was once more able
to use his six giant palms to effortlessly crush the attackers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming for
me.” When the Eastsmoke branch leader saw the towering white-robed
youth fly towards him, an ugly look appeared on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!”
Ning let out a cold roar as his six giant palms sliced through the
air, striking simultaneously at the main palace of the Eastsmoke
branch. The Eastsmoke leader was hiding within the main palace, and
he was as small as an ant compared to the six mighty palms that were
descending.

Chapter 56 - Ji Ning’s Slaves
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around the
main palace was surrounded by rings of light. When the six colossal
heaven-covering hands came crashing down, only the outermost layer of
light was shattered, and they regenerated almost instantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha! There’s
no way you’ll be able to break through.” The Eastsmoke leader was
overjoyed upon seeing this. He stood there in the main palace, a cold
smile on his lips. “This is the main palace. This is the most
important part of the Eastsmoke branch, and it possesses the
strongest defenses. It is guarded by eight layers of defenses, and
you were only able to breach one of them. You aren’t even close!
Since you can’t kill me, you’ll be the one to die. I refuse to
believe you’ll be able to keep this divine ability of yours active
indefinitely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared down
towards him from his position in the skies. Ning nodded slowly as he
mused to himself, “The main palace lives up to its reputation. This
is the source of power for the entire restrictive formation”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand restrictive
formation protecting this place required a formation-core, and the
formation-core was under the control of the Eastsmoke branch leader
and located in the tightly guarded main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to use my full power.” A hint of a smile played at the corner of
Ning’s lips. He then reached out with one hand towards his back,
taking a firm hold over the sword which he had been carrying on his
back this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s about to draw
his sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s been carrying
that sword along this entire time. It seems that sword should be
pretty powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what will
happen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators of the Eastsmoke branch all watched intently, including
both Fairy Qingfan and the Eastsmoke leader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword left its
scabbard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that
Ning drew his sword, five other swords appeared in his other five
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six hands, six Eternal
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Astral stance!” As
soon as Ning drew his swords, his six Eternal blades began to gleam
with blinding light. They transformed into six streaks of bloody
sword-light that descended towards the main palace like a tempest of
blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One layer of light
after another was shattered. The main palace was guarded by eight
formations, and six of them were broken through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shockwaves
generated by the powerful collisions spread out in every direction,
so strong as to cause even the surrounding mountains to crumble and
topple. Countless trees were reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…” The
Eastsmoke leader was so frightened that his face turned bone-white.
He then swallowed, hard. “Thankfully, he didn’t break through. He
won’t be able to break through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this his true
power?” Fairy Qingfan, still standing at the entrance to her
estate, stared at the distant Ji Ning and the six mighty swords he
was wielding. “No wonder little sister Youji was willing to follow
and serve him. How can a World-level cultivator be this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? It actually
didn’t break?” Ning frowned, then raised his head to glance at
the restrictive formations above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning charged high into
the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew he wouldn’t
be able to hold on forever. He had to be using up an enormous amount
of divine power to unleash those attacks.” A hint of delight
appeared on the Eastsmoke leader’s face. Through the formation, he
sent a mental message to the other sixteen cultivators. “Keep using
your formations to attack him. Don’t be fooled by how powerful he
looks. Soon, he won’t be able to fight back at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s
relying on his own power whereas we are relying on our formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t be able
to overpower us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators continued to use their formations to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impudent!” Ning
frowned as he saw the greataxe, the sword, and the blazing Fiendgod
charged towards him once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three streaks of bloody
sword-light shot out into the skies, completely shattering the three
oncoming attacks. Now that Ning was using his Eternal swords, these
formations were nothing to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since I cannot break
through the main palace with a full-force strike, I should give this
grand restrictive formation a try.” Ning flew high into the air,
head raised as he stared at the barrier in front of him. Although he
knew that this barrier had to be extremely tough, he still wanted to
give it a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Six streaks
of sword-light shot out like six meteors, simultaneously raining down
together upon a thirty-meter region of the grand restrictive
formation. Although the formation covered a region of ten million
kilometers, Ning focused all of his attacks on one point. This would
make piercing through it easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the entire
grand restrictive formation trembled slightly, then dispersed the
power of Ning’s attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It didn’t break?”
Ning’s face changed slightly. “Again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the six
streaks of bloody sword-light sliced out once more as Ning furiously
attacked the grand restrictive formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Eastsmoke
branch turned silent. All the World-level cultivators watched as the
white-robed youth used his power to furiously assault the grand
restrictive formation. It would be countless years before they would
ever be able to forget this sight. A World-level cultivator was so
audacious as to challenge the full power of their barrier… and was
able to cause the entire barrier to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent ten
consecutive attacks out against the formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really can’t
break through.” Ning slowly shook his head. “It seems as though
forcing my way out of this formation is impractical.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wasn’t able to
break out of this place, his only option was to carry out his
original plan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head,
staring downwards with a cold light flashing in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning
immediately charged downwards. In just two seconds, he arrived before
a black palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Six
dazzling streaks of sword-light descended upon the the black palace.
Although the black palace was protected by three layers of barriers,
it still exploded into pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three World-level
cultivators hiding within the black palace immediately ran out,
staring at Ning in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single
formation-core was protected by barrier spells, but those barriers
couldn’t possibly compare to the barriers protecting the main
palace! Transcendent World Gods might not be able to breach them, but
Daolords of the First Step would be able to breach them through raw
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning waved
his giant hand. Whoosh! The heavens seemed to turn dark as he
captured all three of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next.” Ning began
to fly towards another formation-core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t stop
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystdragon, this is
all your fault. You ruined us, you idiot! Qingfan was absolutely
right when she said you were an imbecile and buffoon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are all doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He said earlier that
anyone who stands in his way will be killed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blew through the
various formation-cores with ease, capturing all sixteen World-level
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them are
doomed.” The Eastsmoke leader’s face was turning pale from his
position inside the main palace as he watched this happen. “I’m
the only one left. He won’t be able to enter. He can’t break the
main palace’s barrier spells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he consoled
himself by saying this, he was still filled with terror. Although the
barrier was able to trap Ning, it wasn’t able to kill. If too much
time passed, who knew what additional variables might enter the
picture?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
Eastsmoke leader waved his hand, causing a black message-talisman to
appear. He gritted his teeth, then crushed it into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother. You
have to come save me.” The Eastsmoke leader could now sense how
dangerous this foe was. At a time like this, his only option was to
ask his big brother to come protect him. His big brother had always
doted on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main headquarters
of the Bluegrace Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main headquarters
was a vast place, stretching out to cover more than a hundred million
kilometers. There were countless cultivators here, with more than
three thousand World-level cultivators and innumerable Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals. There were also four Daolords! The most powerful
was of course Daolord Bluegrace himself, and he was an extremely
famous and reputable figure within the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
soared into the skies, leaving a deep gorge that was completely
shrouded in black mist. This figure was dressed in black robes, had a
cold and grim face, and looked quite similar to World God Mystdragon,
the branch leader of the Eastsmoke branch. Only, his aura was colder
and darker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystdragon actually
shattered the message-talisman I gave him? What sort of danger has he
encountered?” Daolord Batdragon’s face was grim, but his eyes
were filled with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Him and Mystdragon were
actual brothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely rare
for a pair of fraternal brothers to be able to train together and
reach such heights in cultivation. Batdragon had long ago lost all
his other kinsmen, and his little brother was the only one left. In
truth, Mystdragon wasn’t really strong enough to qualify for his
current position, but since Daolord Batdragon gave him his full
support he was able to become a branch leader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mystdragon. His one and
only little brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go right
now.” Daolord Batdragon didn’t hesitate at all. He immediately
transformed into a streak of light as he flew out of the main
headquarters and towards the Eastsmoke branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the top of a
mountain of the Eastsmoke branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, a
group of thirty-four terrified World-level cultivators before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the thirty-four,
sixteen had been using formations to attack Ning while eighteen were
the Eastsmoke leader’s devoted followers. The eighteen were the
ones who had been keeping tabs on the Flamefairy. Ning had captured
them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighteen of you
obeyed the Eastsmoke branch leader’s orders and wished to slay my
retainer and steal her treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sixteen of you
wished to slay me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the
thirty-four with his gaze. “Quite frankly, I should kill you all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-four were
utterly terrified. When cultivators made the wrong enemy or chose the
wrong master, they would often find themselves in mortal danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I will give
you two options. The first option is death! The second option is to
immediately swear a lifeblood oath to be my slave.” Ning tossed out
an oathstone. “The oath is right here. If you are willing to swear
the oath, you’ll be able to stay alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators had ugly looks on their faces. World Gods and Chaos
Immortals had exalted statuses; how many of them would willingly
become the slave of another?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem was, if
they refused they would die! Ji Ning was simply too powerful, far
more powerful than any World God had a right to be. To submit to him…
it wasn’t completely unacceptable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This oath…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is way too
stringent…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the thirty-four of
them saw the oath, they were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they swore this
oath, they would become absolute slaves who would have to serve Ning
with utter devotion. In fact, they weren’t even permitted to lie to
him! This was one of the most stringent oaths possible. The only
thing that gave them hope was the clause that said they would regain
their freedom after a thousand chaos cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand chaos
cycles? This was an incredibly long period of time. How many
cultivators would even be able to stay alive for that long?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept them with a
glance. He had actually been planning on killing them all, but he had
reconsidered as there was always a need for servants or slaves to
take care of some minor matters that he simply didn’t have time
for. In addition, when he was out adventuring there were some
dangerous places he could use them to scout for him. If some of them
were so lucky as to stay alive for a thousand chaos cycles, for him
to release them then would be fine as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand chaos
cycles? Ning couldn’t even imagine what level of power he would
have reached by then.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One wrong step, and
it all comes to nothing.” Several World-level cultivators raised
their heads and sighed. Their truesouls immediately dissipated as
they perished on the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I chose the wrong
path. I’ll have to bear the consequences.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it, forget
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, a total of
five of them chose suicide. Ning didn’t move to stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other twenty-nine
chose to bow their heads and become Ning’s slaves. As they saw it,
this incomparably terrifying World God would most likely become a
Daolord in the future. They were willing to accept becoming the
servants and slaves of a Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, accepting these twenty-nine World-level slaves.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Mystdragon,
the branch leader of the Eastsmoke branch, continued to hide in the
main palace of the Eastsmoke branch. He watched as all of this
happened, and he felt no sympathy for them at all. Instead, he was
celebrating. “Thank goodness the barriers protecting my main palace
are much stronger. Although this white-robed kid is strong, he still
can’t do a damn thing to me. Hmph! Soon, my big brother will
arrive. By then… hpmh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Mystdragon
felt tremendous confidence in his big brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning suddenly
transformed into a streak of light, flying away from the mountain and
once more charging towards the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming back?”
The Eastsmoke leader was badly frightened. “Why is he coming back?
Does he have some even more powerful tricks up his sleeve?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader’s
heart was filled with alarm. He knew that if he didn’t have these
barriers and had to face Ning by himself, he probably wouldn’t be
able to withstand even a single blow!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bluegrace Sect’s
area of influence was quite large, as was its territory. Its nine
branches were all located in nine different corners of its territory,
and even someone like Daolord Batdragon who flew roughly twice as
fast as the speed of light would need to fly for roughly an entire
day before arriving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Mystdragon
had to hold on for at least a day. By then, his big brother the
Daolord would arrive and he would be safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed in front of
the main palace as a crimson-black gourd appeared behind him. This
was the Elementum Waterflame Gourd. The gourd immediately belched out
the Watersmoke Lightning and the Firecloud Lightning, and the two
mighty streaks of Dao lightning immediately began to hammer down upon
the barrier spells, shattering through the two outermost layers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope this breaks
it.” Ning manifested three heads and six arms, once more wielding
six Violetjewels as he began to furiously assault the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
main palace echoed with the sound of explosions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Ning now
had the Dao lightning helping him, he was still only able to breach
seven of the barriers. The eighth and final barrier remained
unbroken, and it was the strongest barrier of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t break
it.” The Eastsmoke leader laughed coldly as he saw this. “And you
can forget about escaping.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however,
continued to rain down furious blows with his Eternal weapons. As for
his Dao lightning, it was constantly replenished by the natural
energy of Heaven and Earth and thus was also able to attack unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see how long
he can keep attacking for. He has to be using up an enormous amount
of divine power, but I’m using up very little Immortal energy in
maintaining these protective barriers.” The Eastsmoke leader smiled
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours later. Ning
was still furiously attacking, not having taken any break at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
going on.” The Eastsmoke leader had an ugly look on his face. “He
has to be using an insanely powerful divine ability to launch such
powerful attacks. It has to be consuming a thousand times as much
divine power as a normal strike would. How can he keep going for so
long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the barriers themselves used up an incredible amount of energy
after having been breached and repaired so many times. Although most
of this energy came from chaos jewels and the extracted natural
energy of the world, a small part of it did have to come from the
controller of the formation. His Immortal energy was instrumental in
keeping the barriers and the formations active.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After two hours, more
than half of his Immortal energy had been used up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep
fighting then. I’ll be able to hold.” The Eastsmoke leader
gritted his teeth. “I have plenty of chaos jewels. I’ll be able
to fight for a long period of time if I use my chaos jewels to
replenish my energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the fraternal
brother of a Daolord and a branch leader. He naturally had quite a
few chaos jewels, and the main palace itself also had an emergency
cache of chaos jewels to ensure that the formations would remain
active.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning really
was using up quite a bit of energy. Although the azureflower mist
energy was being consumed fairly slowly, it was still being used up
far faster than he could replenish it. If he continued launching
maximum-power attacks like this, he would probably run dry on energy
after six hours. However… the one thing which Ning absolutely did
not lack for was treasures and chaos jewels. For the sake of being
able to end this sooner, using up a few chaos jewels was more than
worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
furious attacks. Every so often, Ning would draw some of the chaos
jewels into his Jindan chaos region and absorb the pure, distilled
chaos energy from the chaos jewels. As for the Eastsmoke leader, he
had naturally started to use chaos jewels well before Ning had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystdragon, I urge
you to just withdraw the formation and let him leave.” Fairy
Qingfan had already flown over to the main palace. In truth, she was
feeling quite stunned at the fact that Ji Ning was able to maintain
such a high intensity over such a long period of time. It must be
understood that World Gods used up divine power at an alarming rate
when they launched full-power attacks. Even if they tried to use
chaos jewels to replenish their energy, it wouldn’t be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a limit to
how fast chaos jewels could be used to replenish energy. Ning used up
energy at a very slow rate, which was why he was able to easily use
chaos jewels to keep himself topped off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For those who truly did
rely on powerful divine abilities to fight, they’d usually run out
of energy after a short battle. There was simply no way for chaos
jewels to keep up with their energy expenditures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You traitor.” The
Eastsmoke leader laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was all caused
by your attempts at robbery. If you let him go, then this matter will
be at an end,” Fairy Qingfan urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At an end? Ahaha,
he’s completely unable to breach the main palace. I’m using up
almost no Immortal energy in keeping the barrier spells active. I’ll
be able to keep going for an extremely long period of time thanks to
my chaos jewels. Soon, my big brother will arrive and he’ll be in
for a world of trouble.” How could the Eastsmoke leader be willing
to give up at a time like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So what if the
white-robed kid belonged to the Twelve Palaces? His big brother was a
member of the Twelve Palaces as well, and a retainer to Daolord
Bluegrace. The Eastsmoke leader didn’t feel any fear at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And if this kid wasn’t
a member of the Twelve Palaces, his big brother could simply kill
him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?” The
furiously attacking Ning cast him a glance. By now, Ning had a belly
full of fire. Anyone who had been forced to continuously launch
full-force attacks for so long would have a belly full of fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wouldn’t mater
even if his big brother is Daolord Bluegrace himself.” Ning was
truly furious now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mystdragon.” The
black-robed Daolord Batdragon was flying through the clouds at high
speed. His nervousness had caused a layer of bloody light to appear
within his eyes. “You have to hang on, Mystdragon. Hang on until I
arrive.” He couldn’t even imagine what sort of threat had caused
his little brother to shatter the message-talisman and beg for
rescue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He needed a full day to
fly from the main headquarters to the Eastsmoke branch. All sorts of
things could happen within a day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t care who
it is, if someone kills my little brother… I, Batdragon, swear that
I will pay any price, up to and including my very life itself, to
take revenge.” The bloody light in Daolord Batdragon’s eyes grew
even more ominous. The two of them had grown up together as children,
then had together embarked upon the path of cultivation. They had
even braved many life-and-death dangers together. The relationship
between the two simply couldn’t be describe by the word ‘deep’
alone. Mystdragon had been the most important person in his life for
countless eons. For the sake of his little brother, he truly was
prepared and willing to give up life itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on. Wait for
me.” Daolord Batdragon continued to fly forwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full day and a full
night later, Daolord Batdragon finally reached the Eastsmoke branch.
Thus far the life-tablet of his little brother, which he carried with
him at all times, was still intact. That meant that his little
brother was still alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. When Daolord
Batdragon arrived at the grand restrictive formation, he immediately
charged in while shouting loudly, “Let me in!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?” The
Eastsmoke leader was instantly overjoyed. As controller of the
formation, he was able to immediately create a small opening for the
black-robed Daolord Batdragon to enter through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere in the
branch instantly turned quite odd and eery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Fairy Qingfan,
and many other World Gods could all sense that something had just
happened to the formation. They saw that black-robed figure fly in,
and they could sense from the overwhelming aura radiating from him.
This was indeed the aura of a Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Batdragon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our branch leader’s
big brother has arrived. That invader will be in trouble now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various World-level
cultivators were all secretly chatting amongst themselves. As for
Ning, he halted his wild attacks and turned to stare at the
black-robed figuring making a beeline in his direction. This
black-robed figure had quite a cold and sinister face which was very
similar to the Eastsmoke leader’s appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” When the
black-robed Daolord Batdragon saw Ning, he could immediately sense
the ripples from a identity medallion of the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon flew
into the main palace, and the barriers surrounding the palace all
vanished. Clearly, the Eastsmoke leader held complete faith in his
big brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” When Daolord
Batdragon saw his little brother, a quck and careful scan showed that
he wasn’t injured at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, this
World-level cultivator barged into my Eastsmoke branch.” The
Eastsmoke branch leader, World God Mystdragon, pointed at Ning as he
howled furiously, “Not only did he kill a group of dozens of my
World-level cultivators, he forcibly abducted and enslaved a second
group. He wanted to kill me, big brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the resentment
he had felt was bubbling out now. With his big brother by his side,
who did he have to fear?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHAP!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon
suddenly struck out with his palm, delivering a vicious blow to the
face of the Eastsmoke leader. The Eastsmoke leader’s face
immediately twisted and distorted as he was sent flying into the
walls of the main palace. BOOM! He collided so hard that the entire
palace shook. The palace walls were now covered with blood as the
Eastsmoke leader lay on the blood-soaked ground, his body twisted
brutally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
raised his head to stare at his elder brother in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
apologized to this fellow Daoist yet!” Daolord Batdragon stared at
him as he furiously roared out these words.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_58___Resolution"></A>
Chapter 58 - Resolution
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
Eastsmoke leader had a befuddled look on his face as he stared at his
elder brother. He was to lower his head and admit that he was in the
wrong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you,
apologize to this fellow Daoist immediately!” Rage blazed in
Daolord Batdragon’s eyes. His voice was very deep, and he growled
out one word at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
felt unhappy with this. So what if this white-robed kid really was a
member of the Twelve Palaces? His big brother was a member as well.
It was forbidden for members of the Twelve Palaces to kill each
other; why should he apologize? But judging from the way in which
Daolord Batdragon had just spoken, the Eastsmoke leader could sense
that his big brother was truly upset this time. He had long ago grown
accustomed to obeying his big brother in all things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was in the wrong.”
The Eastsmoke leader bowed his head towards Ning. “Please pardon
me, fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Batdragon.”
Daolord Batdragon looked at Ning and spoke in a very courteous
manner. “I knew that this good-for-nothing little brother of mine
must have done something to offend you, fellow Daoist. I’m willing
to offer you fifty thousand cubes of chaos nectar in compensation. I
hope that you can spare my little brother, fellow Daoist.” As he
spoke, he produced a circular bracelet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This contains ten
thousand cubes of chaos nectar and two Eternal weapons. The total
value here is fifty thousand cubes. I hope you are willing to accept
this, fellow Daoist.” As Daolord Batdragon spoke, the bracelet flew
straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. An
immediate apology, followed by fifty thousand cubes of chaos nectar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that this
person was a black-armored Daolord, one who had reached that level
only thanks to a Pseudo Samsara Pill. The man wasn’t exactly
wealthy. The fifty thousand cubes probably didn’t represent all of
his wealth, but it definitely would sting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
bracelet, in no hurry to accept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This branch leader had
first tried to kill Su Youji, then tried to kill Ning himself. Even
though Ning had dominated so many World-level cultivators and nearly
breached the main palace, the man had refused to bow his head and
insisted on keeping the grand restrictive formation active,
preventing Ning from leaving in the hopes that his big brother would
arrive. By now, Ning had an extremely deep urge to kill. Was he
supposed to just write it all off due to a small token of
compensation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning wasn’t
able to do anything to the branch leader now that Daolord Batdragon
was here, Ning wasn’t willing to accept the bracelet. Accepting it
meant accepting that this matter was resolved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rage that had built
up in Ning’s breast after a full day of combat was not going to be
quenched so easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swear a lifeblood
oath right now.” After delivering the bracelet, Daolord Batdragon
turned to glare at the Eastsmoke leader. “Within a thousand years,
you must travel to Hydragon Mountain and spend a hundred chaos cycles
there as a miner. I can see that you’ve completely let being the
Eastsmoke leader go to your head. You’ve completely forgotten the
proper way to behave. Go mine and get your thoughts straight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mine for a hundred
chaos cycles?” The Eastsmoke leader was instantly furious. “Big
brother!” A look of rage and resentment was on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you hear
what I just said? Swear the lifeblood oath right away!” Daolord
Batdragon roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
was furious as well. “Big brother, why should we be afraid of this
brat? So what if he is a member of the Twelve-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHAP!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon
delivered another heavy slap. This time, the Eastsmoke leader was
injured even more heavily than last time. He was smashed into the
nearby wall by this palm, completely staining it in his blood. The
Eastbranch leader slowly slid down the wall. He stared at his big
brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon,
seeing the look on his face, instantly sent a furious mental message.
“Do you think I would ever do anything to hurt you?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke leader
slowly began to come to his senses, but he truly didn’t understand.
He sent back, “But big brother, why?! He’s just a World-level
cultivator. Giving him fifty thousand cubes of chaos nectar is
already giving him more face than he deserves. And you are going to
send me off to mine for a hundred chaos cycles? Mining in Hydragon
Mountain is an extremely arduous, boring life. Although it is fairly
safe, it will sometimes be dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Eastsmoke branch
leader, he knew a great deal about the legendary Hydragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hydragon Mountain
wasn’t located in the Brightshore Kingdom. It was one of the
dangerous zones that was located elsewhere in the Endless
Territories. However, the Brightshore Kingdom had taken complete
control over it! Combat was forbidden within Hydragon Mountain,
making it an extremely safe place, but Hydragon Mountain itself would
occasionally give birth to some dangerous things and places. Even
when that happened, the miners would still have to go mine. Thus,
there were occasionally a few casualties, albeit extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And with you here,
big brother, he’s not able to do a damn thing to me. You also
belong to the Twelve Palaces!” The Eastsmoke leader sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot.”
Daolord Batdragon explained, “Yes, both of us are members of the
Twelve Palaces, but… it isn’t the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon
looked at his little brother. “Look. I made my breakthrough because
I used a Pseudo Samsara Pill. I’m a black-armored Daolord, the
lowest-ranked type of Daolord in the Twelve Palaces.” Daolord
Batdragon began to mentally explain some of the hidden secrets
pertaining to the Twelve Palaces. “The Twelve Palaces have some
truly horrifying Daolords who are so strong that many of the other
organizations in the Endless Territories are terrified of them. Do
you think they have the same level of status as me, someone who
relied on a Pseudo Samsara Pill to become a Daolord of the First Step
and who will never make any more advancements?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he’s still not
able to do anything to you, big brother.” The Eastsmoke leader was
beginning to understand, but he remained a bit stubborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wrong.” Daolord
Batdragon sent mentally, “You don’t get it. Members of the Twelve
Palaces are forbidden from fighting amongst each other, but if an
enormous grudge somehow results from something, palace members are
generally expected to go through mediation first! If the mediation
fails, then the result will be a duel to the death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” The Eastsmoke
leader instantly grew excited. He sent mentally, “Then he should be
afraid of you, right? How could he be a match for you in a duel to
the death?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wrong again. I’m a
black-armored Daolord who only reached this level due to a Pseudo
Samsara Pill. How can I be qualified to force him into a duel to the
death?” Daolord Batdragon sent mentally, “Generally speaking, the
Palace Lords or Vice Palace Lords of the Twelve Palaces are the ones
responsible for mediation. Do you think I would dare to reject what
their ruling is? I have no future prospects and my position is low…
but this Darknorth was given direct entry to the Twelve Palaces at
the World level. His future prospects are unlimited! Once he makes
his breakthrough, he will quickly reach the power level of a Daolord
of the Second Step. In fact, he might become even stronger than
that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon shook
his head. “People like me generally end up was retainers to more
powerful Daolords. All we are… are servants.” Daolord Batdragon
sighed. “Little brother, you need to understand that in the Twelve
Palaces, people like me are looked down upon due to having used
Pseudo Samsara Pills. The only reason the other Daolords are somewhat
courteous to me is because I am Daolord Bluegrace’s retainer, and
they wish to give him face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” The
Eastsmoke leader was amazed. He knew none of this, because his big
brother rarely discussed matters pertaining to the Twelve Palaces
with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense.
People like us will never make any more breakthroughs, which is why
we chose to use Pseudo Samsara Pills. To then advance from the First
Step to the Second Step as a Daolord? Absolutely impossible.”
Daolord Batdragon sent mentally, “That’s why I wanted to try and
resolve matters between you and him. Otherwise… even though he
can’t kill you, once he becomes a Daolord he’ll have plenty of
ways to deal with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon
suddenly asked, “Oh, right. What exactly is the problem between the
two of you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be honest, it is
because he has a retainer known as the Flamefairy…” The Eastsmoke
leader didn’t dare to lie to his big brother. He honestly revealed
the entire affair to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You imbecile. He was
actually able to use his godsense to crush the godsenses of more than
three hundred World-level cultivators? Even the Twelve Palaces are
rarely able to recruit World-level cultivators of such power. How
could you possibly be so reckless as to offend a freak like him?”
Daolord Batdragon was once again enraged by what he was hearing. “But
let’s put that aside from now. He furiously attacked the formation
and was able to break through seven of the eight barriers protecting
the main palace. Given how strong he was, what you should’ve done
was just cancel the restrictive formation and let him leave! But you
insisted on forcing him to fight with you for a full day and night.
Also… did he really attack for a full day and night without
resting?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. He didn’t
rest at all.” The Eastsmoke leader was beginning to feel scared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to
attack at maximum power for that long?” Daolord Batdragon was
growing angrier and angrier. “No wonder he’s emanating such a
murderous aura! As soon as I arrived here, I could sense his desire
to kill. When I offered him that bracelet, he didn’t accept it.
Ugh! Ever since I became a Daolord and let you become the Eastsmoke
leader, you became completely full of yourself! If you continue to
act so rashly… even if you survive this time, you’ll have a very
short life ahead of you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I… what should I
do?” The Eastsmoke leader looked at his big brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My worry is that
this Darknorth is a man who holds grudges,” Daolord Batdragon
explains. “Swear a lifeblood oath right away that you’ll go to
Hydragon Mountain. Hydragon Mountain is an important place to the
Hegemon, as that’s where his mines are. No one will dare to attack
you there. A hundred chaos cycles from now, this matter will be
ancient history. If he still holds a grudge after a hundred chaos
cycles, it’ll obviously be a problem with him. I would have an
excuse to ask Daolord Bluegrace to intervene and help out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastsmoke branch
leader now completely understood. He now realized that even his big
brother was nothing more than a small pawn in the Twelve Palaces. If
this Darknorth was the vengeful type, he really would be in trouble
in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, I was in the wrong and let greed blacken my heart.” The
Eastsmoke leader looked at Ning. He bowed respectfully, then
immediately swore a solemn oath. “I swear on my very life itself
that I, Mythdragon, will go to Hydragon Mountain within a thousand
years. I will spend a hundred chaos cycles there as a miner in order
to expiate my sins towards fellow Daoist Darknorth. If I violate this
oath, let my truesoul shatter and let my Dao vanish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, he wasn’t
really worried about Daolord Batdragon as Ning himself already had
the power of a black-armored Daolord. The two were already on par
with each other, but Ning was merely at the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… Ning
understood that with Daolord Batdragon here, it would be extremely
hard for Ning to do anything to the Eastsmoke leader. For the Daolord
to offer a gift and an apology was one thing, but the branch leader
was now swearing to spend a hundred chaos cycles mining at Hydragon
Mountain? A hundred chaos cycles was an extremely long period of
time. There were many cultivators who wouldn’t even live to be that
old. Ning could sense that Daolord Batdragon truly did care about
this little brother of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let this matter
come to an end.” Ning accepted the bracelet, in effect accepting
the proposed resolution. “I won’t stay here any longer.
Farewell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately left
the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon let
out a sigh of relief as he watched Ning accept the bracelet and Ning.
Finally, this matter had been included.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the main
palace. Ning looked at Fairy Qingfan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Qingfan.”
Ning looked at her, then waved his hand and sent a message-talisman
towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan stared
blankly at the message talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This matter has been
concluded, and I trust Daolord Batdragon won’t pursue this matter
any further. Still… if you encounter any problems in the future,
you can shatter this talisman and I’ll immediately hasten to your
side,” Ning said. Fairy Qingfan truly had helped the Flamefairy out
this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Fairy
Qingfan nodded as she slipped her fingers over the talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning soared into the
skies, transforming into a streak of light as he flew off into the
distance. The grand restrictive formation had long ago been lifted,
and Ning soon disappeared into the clouds in the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Qingfan watched
as Ning left, her fingers unconsciously tightening over the talisman.
She murmured to herself, “Just now, if I told him that I wished to
become his retainer, he probably would’ve agreed, right? Perhaps my
path of cultivation and my destiny would both completely change…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of cultivation
was a path which one would have to choose for one’s self. No one
else could make these choices for you, and different choices would
result in different results.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon stood
at the entrance to the main palace, letting out a second sigh of
relief upon seeing Ji Ning disappear. He then turned to stare at his
little brother. He immediately said, “Hurry up and make your
preparations. I’m going to send you away from this place today. You
are going to Hydragon Mountain right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today?” The
Eastsmoke leader hesitated a moment, then nodded. “Alright. I’ll
go make the preparations.” As he spoke, he immediately turned and
left to gather his things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Batdragon mused
to himself, “This Darknorth fellow doesn’t look like the evil,
backstabbing type. This matter probably has truly come to an end.
Still…” Daolord Batdragon glanced in his little brother’s
direction. “It is all for the best. Hydragon Mountain will help to
temper his disposition. Still, it is true that the place can be
dangerous sometimes. Mm… I’ll go and request to become one of the
overseers. I’ll take care of him in secret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were overseers
who were charged with overseeing the mining operations in Hydragon
Mountain. This sort of boring job was almost always carried out by
black-robed Daolords. The stronger Daolords would all be out
adventuring. None of them would be willing to do this job.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I have to help
him out in secret. I can’t let him know.” Daolord Batdragon made
his decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the matter had
been resolved, Ning and Su Youji began to advance in their flying
vessel. They spent five months flying before finally reaching the
Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So beautiful.” Su
Youji stared at the surroundings from within the flying vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared off into
the distance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the edges of the
horizon, twelve enormous palaces could be seen hovering there in
midair. In their center was a dim black cavern. Those twelve palaces
were the actual Twelve Palaces. They looked quite close to each
other, but in reality the palaces were all separated by many layers
of space. They were actually many trillions of kilometers away from
each other, but the almighty Hegemon was so powerful that he was able
to make them look as though they were located right next to each
other. Together, these Twelve Palaces formed the most supremely
powerful formation the Brightshore Kingdom had to offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Eternal Emperors
would not dare to enter the Twelve Palaces without permission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the Sword
Palace.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
quickly began to move towards the direction of the Palace of the
Sword.
