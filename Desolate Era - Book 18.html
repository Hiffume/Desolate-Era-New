Chapter 1 - Evacuation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
landed onto the ground. Upon seeing him appear, the servants and
maids of Brightheart Island all called out in respectful unison,
“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you’ve
returned.” A frantic-looking, black-robed Ji Truekeep came walking
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Truekeep.”
Ning smiled. “What has you looking so worried?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I not be
worried? If it weren’t for the fact that I knew you were undergoing
your tribulation, I would’ve gone looking for you long ago. Thank
goodness…thank goodness you are back!” As Truekeep spoke, an
armored soldier began to walk towards them from not too far away.
Ning immediately recognized this man as a captain of the Imperial
Guard of the imperial capital, a Loose Immortal soldier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep immediately
said, “This general came all the way here from the imperial capital
on the Xia Emperor’s orders. He’s been waiting here for you for
two months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two months?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you didn’t come
back in three days…I would’ve gone looking for you, even thought
I know you were undergoing your tribulation,” Truekeep said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that Ning’s
Primaltwin was undergoing the Celestial Tribulation wasn’t a
secret; both the Xia Emperor and the Seamless Gate knew, and so Ning
couldn’t be bothered to hide it from anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does the Xia Emperor
need something?” Ning looked towards the Imperial Guard captain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captain said
respectfully, “Immortal Darknorth, I have come on the orders of the
Xia Emperor to deliver this to you in person.” He held up a leather
scroll, offering it to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out to
accept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be leaving
now.” The captain immediately turned to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me send you
off.” Clan leader Ji Truekeep moved to escort the captain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning opened the
leather scroll. The nearby Immortal Diancai and Yu Wei were both
puzzled; what urgent matter was this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
contents of the leather scroll, Ning’s face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, what is
it?” Immortal Diancai asked. “Of course, if it’s something that
cannot be told to others, you don’t have to tell me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no point
to keeping this a secret,” Ning said. By now, Truekeep had returned
as well. Truekeep said nervously, “All I know is that the messenger
captain said that this is critically urgent news that had to be
delivered to you, Ji Ning, before the sixth day of the eighth month.
Thankfully, you finally came back with seven days to spare.
Right…what is this about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept everyone
present with his gaze. Mu Northson, Little Qing, Autumn Leaf,
Immortal Diancai, and Yu Wei all looked back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
about to truly launch their war against the Grand Xia,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“War?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it’s finally
starting…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all felt their
hearts sink. All of them, however, had mentally prepared themselves
for this long ago. Some major worlds of the Three Realms had already
descended into war, and some of the weaker ones had already been
subjugated. But of course, things happened more slowly with the more
powerful major worlds. The Grand Xia was one example; things were
just beginning here. The Seamless Gate’s attempted conquest of it
wasn’t something that could be resolved in a day or two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By now…everyone
will have to choose a side,” Ning said. “I trust that soon, the
entire Grand Xia will be divided into two sides. One will be the Xia
Emperor’s side, which is to say Daofather Crimsonbright’s side.
The other will of course be the Seamless Gate’s side. Naturally…I
will of course stand with the Xia Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Everyone
present nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew of the
feud between Ning and the Seamless Gate. Ning was their leader; they
naturally would follow him wherever he led.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In turn, Ning was
definitely going to follow Patriarch Subhuti. Subhuti, Daoist
Threelives…both of them were on the side of the Nuwa Alliance. Be
it for personal reasons or organizational reasons, Ning was
definitely going to stand with the Nuwa Alliance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The evening of the
sixth, I am to head to the Skylight Palace of the imperial capital. I
imagine many Celestial Immortals will be present, and even True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods will appear,” Ning said. “Of the Ji
clan, I am the only person required to take part in battle; no one
else needs to participate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what of the
Black-White College?” Immortal Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine this same
information has been sent to the Black-White College already,” Ning
said. “I don’t know the details with regards to the College;
Master, if you return to the College, you should be able to find out
right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’ll go
back right away to take a look.” Immortal Diancai nodded, then
immediately flew away on a cloud, quickly disappearing into the
horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued, “On
the sixth day of the eighth month, I am to go to the Skylight Palace.
Before the sixth…the Ji clan needs to evacuate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evacuate?” Autumn
Leaf, Ji Truekeep, Uncle White, and the others were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, where are
we evacuating to?” Truekeep asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is a Pure Yang
treasure, a ‘Violetdawn Pearl’.” Ning waved his hand, and a
mottled, violet-colored pearl appeared out of nowhere. This pearl was
one of the Pure Yang treasures which Ning had acquired when he
attacked those eighteen Celestial Immortals of the Seamless Gate.
Alas, although those eighteen had a few Pure Yang treasures, none of
them had any top-grade treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Violetdawn Pearl
was used to capture and bewilder foes. It contained a minor world
within it that was comparable to the Earth of his previous life in
size. It would be very simple to have the Ji clansmen move there and
live there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Pure Yang
treasure?” Truekeep was rather stunned. To many Immortal
cultivators, Pure Yang treasures were mere myths. Only Celestial
Immortals could even use Pure Yang treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and the others,
however, were quite calm; they had far more experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While the war is
going on in the Grand Xia, I won’t be able to guarantee the safety
of Swallow Mountain. Evacuation is the only option,” Ning said.
“Uncle Truekeep, don’t worry; I will definitely protect the Ji
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ll go
give the order right now to have the clansmen make their
preparations,” Truekeep said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Three days
from now, we will begin the evacuation,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Immortal Diancai,
Yu Wei, and Celestial Immortal Unity were meeting at the Black-White
College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per the Xia
Emperor’s orders…the two Celestial Immortals of the Black-White
College, along with all of the Loose Immortals, must arrive at the
imperial palace of the Grand Xia by the evening of the sixth,”
Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Northmont clan
of Stillwater received the same order; all the Loose Immortals and
Celestial Immortals must go.” Unity sighed. “The Xia Emperor is
being fairly benevolent; he isn’t forcing us to send our Primal
Daoists or Earth Immortals into battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unity then chuckled.
“Right; the Seamless Gate has sent yet another a messenger to me.
They are inviting me to go to Whitepole City on the sixth. They said
that if I went, I would no longer be an enemy; I would be a friend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually dare
to send yet another invitation?” Immortal Diancai was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps the Seamless
Gate thinks that senior Unity might lose his mind and join them,”
Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the looks of
it, neither the Xia Emperor nor the Seamless Gate is going to hide
their conflict any longer. Both of them chose the sixth of the eighth
month…” Unity sighed. “However, one meeting is at the imperial
palace of the Grand Xia, while the other is at Whitepole City. It
seems as though Whitepole City has already joined the Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Immortal
Diancai, and the others all had solemn looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whitepole City…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a very low-key
city, an incredibly low-key city. It was incredibly rare for people
in the imperial capital of the Grand Xia to hear of any news from
Whitepole City. However, the Whitepole clan clan was one of the top
ten ancient clans of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. They were content
to just hold onto a small piece of land, and they had no interest in
going to the imperial capital to take up official positions. Instead,
they had built up their fief of Whitepole Commandery to the point
where it was almost completely invulnerable to attack. The power of
this clan was actually greater than that of the brash Youngflame
clan’s! Who would’ve thought that they would have silently,
wordlessly joined the Seamless Gate? Their city had even ended up as
the headquarters for the Seamless Gate’s conference! From this, one
could see how much the Seamless Gate trusted the Whitepole clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why the
Xia Emperor was able to force the other clans to join him was because
he had the Primordial Imperial Clan behind him; this was why he was
able to finally unify the world,” Unity said. “In truth, however,
there had been many clans that were struggling quite fiercely against
the Xiamang clan. The Whitepole clan was one of the clans that
struggled with the Xiamang clan for supremacy. However…they didn’t
have enough of a foundation, and so in the end they submitted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the many clans of
the world all joined forces, the Xiamang clan would be completely
unable to resist them,” Unity continued. “In fact…there have
been marquis-led rebellions in the past. Only after that did the Xia
Emperor set up the massive commandery cities to further solidify his
rule.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder…how many
marquises have joined the Seamless Gate?” Unity sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
amongst the various marquises.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of the
Xiamang clan and the Kindwater clan were all branches of major clans
of the Primordial Era!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitepole clan,
however, originally belonged to Celestial Immortal Whitepole, a lone
cultivator. After Pangu’s World was destroyed, Celestial Immortal
Whitepole had established his clan within the newly created world
that was later known as the Grand Xia. Afterwards, he had broken
through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal; this naturally resulted
in the Whitepole clan flourishing and becoming powerful.
Alas…Whitepole didn’t have any powerful backers, as he had
created his clan by himself, unlike the Xiamang clan or the Kindwater
clan, which had the major clans of the Primordial Era behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Whitepole has always been very low-key. After the Grand Xia was
unified, he has never acted against the Grand Xia Dynasty,” Unity
said. “In addition, I know of two others at the True Immortal or
Empyrean God level; one belongs to the Kindwater clan, the other
belongs to the Skyfarmer clan. Neither of them acted against the
Grand Xia either; clearly, they aren’t willing to make enemies out
of the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skyfarmer clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that the
Kindwater clan had an Empyrean God behind it, but this was the first
time he had heard that the Skyfarmer clan had such a power behind it
as well. Celestial Immortal Unity, who had lived through the Fiendgod
Era, truly was a man who knew many mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group, without
question, stood by the side of the Xia Emperor. However, they
couldn’t help but feel worried by how powerful the Seamless Gate’s
side was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two sides were
struggling for supremacy…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Would the Xia Emperor
suffer a disastrous defeat, or would the Seamless Gate be sent
fleeing in disgrace?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of this was unknown
for now. However, one thing was certain…this was going to be a
savage, cruel war! After all, many major worlds had already been
conquered, while many others were already burning in the fires of
war. The power of the Seamless Gate…it caused everyone in the Three
Realms to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Primaltwin was
able to easily bind the Pure Yang treasure, ‘Violetdawn Pearl’.
The evacuation of the Ji clan started. Since there weren’t many Ji
clansmen to begin with, the evacuation was fairly simple; in just the
time needed to boil a kettle of tea, the evacuation was completedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Uncle
White, Little Qing, Autumn Leaf, Mu Northson, and Ji Truekeep stood
atop the clouds, staring down at the vast world below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave
Swallow Mountain.” Truekeep let out a sigh. This was the land which
countless generations of the Ji clan had worked to till and make
prosperous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll be back,”
the black-robed Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly waved his
hand, releasing his Celestial Immortal energy. Using a worldshaping
technique, he manifested an utterly enormous palm out of natural
energy, a palm that was many hundreds of kilometers in size. The
enormous palm looked misty and blurry, as it was formed by energy and
air. Suddenly, the giant palm made a downwards grab!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Serpentwing
Lake, along with the centermost Brightheart Island, was caught up by
the giant palm. Not even a single drop of water was missed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Ning
used a technique, instantly drawing the entire Serpentwing Lake into
the Violetdawn Pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake held
extraordinary meaning for him. He didn’t want to leave Serpentwing
Lake here. If it ended up being destroyed…he would be filled with
endless regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had the energy
of a Pure Yang True Immortal, he would’ve been able to move away
the entire Swallow Mountain region of a hundred thousand kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
emerged from the Wargod Hall. He had just successfully challenged the
highest level of the Wargod Hall, the tenth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The war is about to
begin. It is time for me to find a suitable Pure Yang treasure for
myself.” Ning headed straight for the Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_2___Ten_Thousand_Immorta"></A>
Chapter 2 - Ten Thousand Immortals Converge
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the tenth
level was seemingly difficult, in truth Ji Ning had already acquired
the power to overcome it by the time he had returned from the Nihilum
Zone. However, since his Primaltwin had yet to overcome the
tribulation, he wouldn’t have been able to put the Pure Yang
treasure to any use, and so he hadn’t been in a rush to attempt it.
The treasure he had acquired last time, the ‘Sole-Ki Nine Element
Pearls’, he had traded to the Xia Emperor for many other treasures,
so as to repair the Rahu Bow and train in both the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] and the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, there was no
way Ning would trade the treasure away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war was beginning.
He needed powerful treasures for it! Although he had acquired quite a
few treasures from the Seamless Gate, especially the three top-grade
Pure Yang treasures and the Protocosmic spirit-treasure which Old Man
Yuan had given him, alas…the only treasure which was of significant
use to him was the Nineleaf Snowlotus. The others weren’t very
useful to him; in fact, they weren’t even of great use to Yu Wei.
Thus, Ning had given one of the Pure Yang treasures to Immortal
Diancai, then put the others into storage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope there are
flying swords.” As Ning stepped into the Treasure Hall, he saw the
giant yellow bear waiting for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you can now
choose one of the twenty-two Pure Yang treasures we have available.”
The giant yellow bear waved his hand, and a book instantly flew
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are only five
more choices than last time?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are Pure Yang
treasures. How many do you think we have?” The giant yellow bear
was irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, Ning had
chosen the Sole-Ki Nine Element Pearls out of eighteen available
choices, leaving behind seventeen. Now, five more choices appeared
for a total of twenty-two. In truth, however…Ning didn’t fancy
any of the previous seventeen, and so he would really be choosing
from these five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you become an
Empyrean God and become the master of the Starseizing Manor, you’ll
be able to acquire better treasures. For now…you’ll have to
continue to act in accordance with Master’s rules,” the big bear
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, then
lowered his head to flip through the books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had to…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There simply had to be
top-grade Pure Yang flying swords here! His Primaltwin’s [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation] truly needed flying swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How extraordinary.”
Ning could barely breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pure Yang treasures
which Daoist Threelives had collected truly were not treasures which
most Empyrean Gods or True Immortals could hope to touch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
preciousness…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five Pure Yang
treasures, the most precious treasure was a set known as the ‘Nine
Invisible Mother-Son Hooks’. This was a treasure set formed by nine
top-grade and eighty-one middle grade Pure Yang-level poison hooks.
They formed into nine mother-son formation sets that could lock down
space itself, preventing foes from using Greater Teleportation! In
addition, they were extremely fast and possessed astonishing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Ning needed
swords, not poison hooks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two sets of
flying swords…” Ning revealed a look of delight. Of the five
sets, two were actually sword-sets. It seemed as though the giant
yellow bear had really been very thoughtful in bringing these out for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first set of flying
swords was known as the Three Pure Ones. These were three top-grade
Pure Yang swords that were personally forged by the leader of the
Daoist Path, Daoist Three Purities. These three flying swords were
extraordinary, even amongst top-grade Pure Yang swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life on
Earth, Ning had heard of the legends of the Three Pure Ones. However,
only after he had embarked upon the path of Immortal cultivation and
had become apprenticed to Subhuti had he truly understood that
Earth’s myths regarding the Exalted Celestial of Primordial
Origins, the Exalted Celestial of the Virtuous Dao, and the Exalted
Celestial of the Luminous Treasure were all about the same person.
These three, the Three Pure Ones, were merely the three mighty
incarnations of Daoist Three Purities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the leader of the
Daoist Path, Daoist Three Purities was acknowledged without dispute
as one of the most powerful figures of the Three Realms. The only
person one might dare to proclaim as being more powerful as him would
probably be Mother Nuwa, who had left the Three Realms to enter the
endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second set of
flying swords were known as the Ananda 1 World-Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ananda was the
attendant and protector of the leader of the Buddhist Sangha.
Although he was merely an ‘attendant’, he was also someone who
was at the Buddha (Daofather) level of power. His status within the
Buddhist Sangha was extremely high, definitely high enough to rank in
the top ten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ananda World-Swords
were nine top-grade Pure Yang flying swords that had been personally
fashioned by Buddha Ananda. They were incomparably sharp, capable of
cutting through the miseries of the mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that one of these two sets would have been forged by the leader of
the Daoist Path, while the other was created by Buddha Ananda of the
Buddhist Sangha.” Ning laughed. He was a disciple of Subhuti;
although Subhuti knew both Daoist and Buddhist divine abilities and
spells, he belonged to neither camp. Both the Daoist Way and the
Buddhist Sangha belonged to Mother Nuwa’s side; they could be
considered allies and friends of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you made your
choice?” The giant yellow bear asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ananda
World-Swords, I suppose.” Ning smiled. “They are nine top-grade
Pure Yang flying swords; they can serve as a formation-base, allowing
the power of my [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] to increase
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
waved his paw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep from the thronging
mass of treasures that hovered in the air above the Treasure Hall, a
massively powerful ripple suddenly spread out. Nine flying swords
that were completely lacquered came descending downwards, appearing
in front of Ji Ning. At the same time, nine little monks that glowed
with golden light flew out from the nine swords. The little monks
were bald and all dressed yellow robes, and they looked as if they
were seven or eight years old.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All nine of these
little monks, however, possessed sharp auras that were filled with
killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are our new
master?” One of the little monks said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shall you work to
sever misery and its bringers from the world, bringing blessings to
the countless living beings of the world?” The little monk asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. “A storm
has arisen, and I shall naturally be forced to kill. I am, however,
on the same side as the one who created you, Buddha Ananda.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine little monks
immediately folded their hands together into a prayer. “Amitabha.”
2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the nine top-grade
Pure Yang swords serving as a formation-base, and the hundreds of
top-grade Immortal-ranked swords supporting them…the power of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] instantly increased to become far
more greater than that of the Nineleaf Snowlotus, which was a high
grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure. Top-grade Pure Yang treasures were
normally only comparable to middle grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures, but nine of them combined into a large formation
naturally resulted in more power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
Nineleaf Snowlotus was mainly meant for trapping and binding foes,
while Immortal swords were meant for launching attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth day of the
eighth month. Night was descending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Unity, the black-robed Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Immortal Diancai, and more
than two hundred Loose Immortals all soared into the skies in
awe-inspiring fashion, then left through teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hundred Loose
Immortals…this represented all of the Loose Immortals of Stillwater
Commandery! The various major schools and sects of Stillwater
Commandery, such as the Skysplitter Sword Sect, the Hundred Flowers
Fairyland, the Dragonhunter clan, and the Eastriver clan actually had
even more Loose Immortals than the Black-White College did…and now,
all of them were being mobilized. There was no way any of them would
dare to violate the Xia Emperor’s orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The war really is
starting. All the Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals are being
dragged into it.” Upon seeing more than two hundred Loose Immortals
gather here, Ning couldn’t help but secretly sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The air above the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One spatial ripple
after another appeared, followed by the emergence of squads of
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals. Every squad had at least a
few dozen people, while some had several thousand! If the Youngflame
clan hadn’t joined the Seamless Gate, their three commanderies
would’ve sent the thousands of Loose Immortals they possessed as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This day was simply too
stunning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless citizens of
the imperial capital raised their heads, staring at the skies. Upon
seeing a countless number of Loose Immortals pour in at a steady
rate, and even many exalted Celestial Immortals appear, everyone was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have to all be
at least Loose Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local citizens were
completely dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Immortals,
they shot out like an endless stream of meteors, shooting through the
skies towards the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of two
hundred or so from Stillwater Commandery arrived as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many.” As Ning
stared at the many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals who had
been gathered here, he couldn’t help but feel stunned as well. At
the same time, he felt a hint of dread in his heart. “So many
Immortals…even Empyrean Gods or True Immortals would be in grave
danger if they tried to fight by themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at Yu Wei. Yu Wei’s belly still wasn’t protruding yet; Ning was a
Fiendgod, after all, while Yu Wei was a Celestial Immortal. Their
child would spend a fairly long period of time gestating in her womb.
Ning mused silently to himself, “She’s pregnant; it wouldn’t be
appropriate for her to go out into battle. I need to have a chat with
the Xia Emperor about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The delegation from
Stillwater Commandery flew towards the imperial palace as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plaza below the
imperial palace. Countless figures had appeared here; it truly was a
veritable ocean of people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor had
given the order long ago that only Celestial Immortals were qualified
to go into the Skylight Palace and congregate there. The main reason
for this was that there were simply far too many Loose Immortals;
there was no way the Skylight Palace could possibly fit that many
people aside. Were all the Immortals supposed to be packed in
together shoulder-to-shoulder? Even back during the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, only a few thousand people had been permitted to
sit within the main hall of the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wait here.”
Celestial Immortal Unity gave the order, and the two hundred-plus
Loose Immortals all landed, leaving Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Immortal
Diancai, and Unity to continue flying forwards by themselves towards
the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Skylight
Palace. Many Celestial Immortals were gathered here, having rushed
here from throughout the 3600 commanderies and the four seas.
Although the Seamless Gate had worked hard to pull others into their
orbit, over the course of countless years, these Celestial Immortals
had all become tightly drawn into Daofather Crimsonbright’s
alliance. Thus, many of them had still chosen to come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many.” Ning, Yu
Wei, Immortal Diancai, and Celestial Immortal Unity all entered the
palace, and as they did they felt breathless for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There has to be at
least six…seven thousand people here!” Ning swept his gaze
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s arrival
caused quite a few Celestial Immortals to head towards them to chat
with him. Of course, they said a few things to Celestial Immortal
Unity, Yu Wei, and Immortal Diancai as well, but most of them clearly
came over to chat with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Unity had been in seclusion for far, far too long. Immortal Diancai
was the least-known of the group, with Yu Wei being slightly better
off thanks to her being Patriarch Lu’s disciple. As for Ji Ning, he
was a monstrous genius who was capable of resisting nine Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan while being merely at the Void
level. He was also the disciple of a Daofather with unfathomable
power. Naturally, the various Celestial Immortals wanted to become
better acquainted with Ning; that way, if they encountered any
problems in the future and they wanted to ask Ning to help out, Ning
would at least have met them before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Celestial
Immortals.” Yu Wei couldn’t help but feel stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, many
major clans were hiding some of their oldest experts, who lived in
seclusion. The exact number of Celestial Immortals each clan had was
always a mystery. However, the storm has now swept the Three Realms.
The Xia Emperor has personally ordered them to show up, which is
equivalent to Daofather Crimsonbright ordering to them to attend.
None of them dare to disobey; after all, Daofather Crimsonbright
knows exactly how many Celestial Immortals are under his control,”
Unity said. “Thus…now that so many of the hidden ones have
appeared, the total number is naturally quite high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time flowed on, more
and more Celestial Immortals arrived. Soon, the number reached over
nine thousand, continuing to climb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t any
Empyrean Gods or True Immortals arrived?” Immortal Diancai was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine the Xia
Emperor has invited all the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to meet
with him privately,” Celestial Immortal Unity said. “They have
higher statuses than we do, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another two hours
passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
within the Skylight Palace were all provided arranged seating by the
attendants here. They each had tables placed in front of them,
allowing the entire hall to just barely fit in all of the ten
thousand-plus Celestial Immortals who had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial Majesty
has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Celestial
Immortals turned their heads in unison to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor was walking in through a side door…and behind him, there
were five True Immortals or Empyrean Gods who had auras as powerful
as his!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor sat up
high in his throne, gazing down at his subjects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We bow in respect to
you, Imperial Majesty.” Instantly, the five True Immortals and
Empyrean Gods all bowed and called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We bow in respect to
you, Imperial Majesty.” The more than ten thousand Celestial
Immortals present all rose to their feet, bowing and calling out in
unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor sat
atop his throne, staring down at his bowing subjects while feeling
high-spirited. To have more than ten thousand Celestial Immortals
bowing towards him…this was a first for even the Xia Emperor
himself!

Chapter 3 - Xingtian, Heaven Punisher
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Grand Xia had
been unified, all of the Immortals and Gods had come to pay their
respects…but that was after countless years of wars against the
Fiendgods, resulting in catastrophic casualties. Very few Celestial
Immortals were alive after those wars. Now that the Grand Xia had
been at peace for so many eons, the total number of Celestial
Immortals within the Grand Xia had reached astonishing heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
tribulation like none we have ever faced before. I wonder…how many
of them will be alive at its conclusion?” The Xia Emperor stared
downwards, sighing privately to himself. “I’m not even sure if I
myself will survive…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise,” the Xia
Emperor said aloud. “Take your seats.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all took their seats. Immortal fruit and nectars were placed in front
of them, but none of the Immortals were in the mood for food. They
were all waiting to hear the Xia Emperor’s words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, look; it seems as though the Dongyan Forefather
is amongst those five True Immortals up there,” Yu Wei suddenly
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dongyan
Forefather?!” Ning was shocked, immediately looking over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the group of
five, there was a man dressed in plain blue robes. He looked quite
ordinary, but his aura was that of a True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dongyan Forefather
was the pillar that held up the skies for the Dongyan clan! Ninelotus
was now the current clan leader for the Dongyan clan, and during the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, Ning had personally seen the Dongyan
Forefather. However, back then he had merely been a Celestial
Immortal. Who would’ve thought that when upon his next appearance,
he was a Pure Yang True Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly thought
of what his master, Subhuti, had told him. He couldn’t help but
sigh to himself. “The world of the Grand Xia truly is a world of
crouching tigers and hidden dragons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My many fellow
Immortal…” The Xia Emperor finally spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone
looked at him. Ning no longer pondered on the Dongyan clan, also
focusing on the Xia Emperor’s words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust all of you,
fellow Immortals, know what our current situation is like.” The
black-robed Xia Emperor’s voice was very somber. The Seamless Gate
has summoned a storm that is sweeping through the entire Grand Xia.
By now, hundreds of the weaker major worlds of the Three Realms have
already been fully subjugated by them. In addition to those, more
than a thousand major worlds have been embroiled by the flames of
war…and our Grand Xia has also become embroiled into a war against
the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone felt heaviness
in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of major
worlds had already been subjugated? They hadn’t know this
previously, before the Xia Emperor announced it. It must be
understood that the Three Realms only had three thousand major worlds
to begin with; as for the trillion minor worlds, they were far, far
weaker. Any clan or school could easily take over a minor world,
which was why in the short run it didn’t really matter who the
minor worlds belonged to. The major worlds were the places where both
sides were fighting!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
indeed powerful.” The Xia Emperor nodded. “If we were weak and
divided like a pile of loose sound, we would’ve been broken apart
and defeated individually by them long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…we are
unified!” The Xia Emperor’s eyes flashed with divine light. “The
Seamless Gate’s power is unfathomable, but we have the many
Daofathers and Buddhas of the Daoist Path and Buddhist Sangha behind
us, as well as the many True Gods who were born from the primordial
chaos and many other major powers with unbelievable might. Our power
is great as well! If the Seamless Gate was capable of completely
suppressing us with force, they would’ve swept through and taken
over the Three Realms long ago. They wouldn’t have settled upon
their current plan of launching sneak attacks everywhere in such a
cautious manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why so many
Celestial Immortals had come was because they were all quite
confident in their side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their own alliance,
after all, was an incredibly powerful one as well. They were also
under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright, who was under the
command of Mother Nuwa. So many major powers…they made up a force
of utterly inconceivably terrifying might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In war, there is
triage. Some places have to be abandoned, while some places must be
protected,” the Xia Emperor said. “Our power, although great,
doesn’t allow us to protect every single world of the three
thousand major worlds. Thus, we have to abandon a few of those
places, allowing us to concentrate our strength to protect the
important worlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the Grand Xia…is
one of the places we have to protect!” The Xia Emperor’s voice
carried a terrifying, combative will within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone listening,
however, felt uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, the
Empyrean God and True Immortal rulers of the other conquered major
worlds had said the same things to their subordinates…that their
world ‘had to be protected’. Otherwise, how could they have
convinced their Celestial Immortals to fight for them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor swept
his subjects with his gaze, understanding their concerns. He
immediately said, “The karmic luck of our Grand Xia is one of the
highest of all the three thousand major worlds of the Three Realms.
In the face of a tribulation like this, the war over karmic luck is a
critically important component. Even the loss of ten of those weaker
major worlds wouldn’t compare to our Grand Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone below him
nodded. This was definitely true!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…the Grand Xia
absolutely not must be lost,” the Xia Emperor said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our side already has
eleven thousand Celestial Immortals and more than a million Loose
Immortals!” The Xia Emperor continued, “I have spoken with
multiple True Gods and Daofathers regarding how the Grand Xia shall
defend against our foes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Immortals all
felt their hearts clench. Multiple True Gods and Daofathers? They all
listened attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eleven thousand
Celestial Immortals, more than a million Loose Immortals…although
this figure was stunning, everyone had already guessed at it after
seeing the veritable sea of Loose Immortals present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have decided upon
our plan,” the Xia Emperor said. “Of the elven thousand Celestial
Immortals, two thousand will be under my direct command! The other
nine thousand will be divided up into nine major armies, each of
which will consist of a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals. Every single army will train in the ‘Heaven
Punisher Formation’. During the conference, True God Xingtian 1
personally agreed to transmit this grand formation to me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xingtian the Heaven
Punisher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone revealed a
look of shock and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Xingtian was
extremely famous in the Three Realms. He was a figure out of the
oldest legends. Long ago, during the era of Pangu’s World, Xingtian
had been merely an Empyrean God, one of the mighty generals under the
command of humanity’s Primordial Imperial Clan. Early on during the
Primordial Era, although humans were a very powerful race and the
Human Emperor was acknowledged as a true Emperor, the thousands of
other races were all quite powerful as well. The monsters, for
example, were only slightly weaker than the humans. Thus, the major
powers had all worked together to establish the Celestial Court. As
for the Celestial Emperor, his job was to assure peace between the
various parties, so as to ensure the safety and stability of the
Primordial World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, the Human
Emperor had been a truly dominating force. The Celestial Emperor, by
contrast, was merely a mediator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During that era,
Xingtian had a quarrel with the Celestial Emperor, resulting in him
launching a direct assault against the Celestial Court. Xingtian was
a general of the imperial clan who was extremely skilled in battle.
Although the Celestial Emperor had some Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals by his side, they were unable to withstand Xingtian. In the
end, the Celestial Emperor had been forced to go all-out and also
invite other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to assist him before he
had been able to suppress Xingtian. In the end, they actually managed
to chop off Xingtian’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, as a Fiendgod,
Xingtian naturally wouldn’t die after having his head severed.
However, Xingtian was an excessively proud person. Much like how
Daoist Threelives had been unwilling to regrow his severed arm,
Xingtian had been unwilling to regrow his head after it was cut off.
Instead, he transformed his nipples into eyes and his bellybutton
into his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that as a result of that wild battle, Xingtian would actually break
through from being an Empyrean God to the True God level? He had
instantly executed the Celestial Emperor. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial Imperial
Clan of humans had gained yet another True God; they were naturally
delighted by this and were completely determined to protect Xingtian.
The other major powers didn’t quibble too much; after all, Xingtian
had already become a True God, and that was that. They ended up just
choosing a new Celestial Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Xingtian, a
member of the Primordial Imperial Clan, had bestowed upon the Xia
Emperor the ‘Heaven Punisher Formation’; clearly, he was standing
alongside the Xia Emperor as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that the Xia
Emperor had the Primordial Imperial Clan behind him was yet another
reason why all of these Celestial Immortals were willing to risk
their lives for him. The Primordial Imperial Clan was simply too
strong! It had multiple major powers within its ranks, and the most
ancient members, the Human Emperors, definitely were some of the most
supreme figures of the Three Realms. The Human Emperors included many
ancient figures, such as Suiren of the Flame and Shennong the Divine
Farmer. 3 Even the leaders of the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Way
worked to befriend the human race; from this, one could tell how
powerful the Primordial Imperial Clan of humans was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven Punisher
Formation requires a commander, a thousand Celestial Immortals, and a
hundred thousand Loose Immortals working in unison,” the Xia
Emperor said. “This enormous formation has the power to link into
the energy of the natural world. The hundred thousand Loose Immortals
serve as a powerful foundation that will pull in natural energy from
an area of a million kilometers. The Celestial Immortals will guide
them to use that energy to form a Xingtian Divinity which is so
powerful that even Empyrean Gods and True Immortals will find hard to
damage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
sighed in amazement upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What an incredible
effort the Xia Emperor had made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Loose Immortals
all struck out without coordination without guidance, they would be
completely and effortlessly slaughtered. However, once a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals activated the power of the natural
world…they would be able to make a much larger difference. It
wasn’t hard for a single Loose Immortal to fully activate the
natural energy for an area of ten thousand kilometers. A hundred
thousand Loose Immortals could definitely activate all of the energy
for an area of a million kilometers. So much natural energy…how
terrifying that had to be! Not even Empyrean Gods or True Immortals
were at such a ridiculous level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, although
the Loose Immortals could activate the energy, they wouldn’t be
able to control it. Thus, a thousand Celestial Immortals were needed
to provide guidance and to mobilize that energy, serving as the
skeleton and spine…and of course, a commander was needed to serve
as the head, in charge of everything. Only then could the power of
this mighty Heaven Punisher Formation be unleashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will transmit to
all the Loose Immortals the basic fundaments of the Heaven Punisher
Formation,” the Xia Emperor said. “But of course, I’ll leave
out the most important parts of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll choose the
commanders of the nine armies from the eleven thousand of you.” The
Xia Emperor looked downwards, and instantly everyone below him began
to murmur. To command a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals…who wouldn’t be willing to accept such
an honor? All of them wanted to be commanders, not soldiers. They had
thought that the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would take up those
positions; who would’ve thought that the Xia Emperor would choose
from the Celestial Immortals?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most important
part of the Heaven Punisher Formation is the activation of natural
energy by the Loose Immortals; an Empyrean God or True God leading it
wouldn’t actually add that much power to it,” the Xia Emperor
said. “Thus, I’m choosing from the Celestial Immortals. As for
the True Gods and Empyrean Gods…at critical moments, they’ll help
you out and deal heavy blows to the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you all
half a month,” the Xia Emperor said. “During this period of time,
you are to fully learn and understand the Heaven Punisher Formation,
and you’ll have a chance to fight for the opportunity to become a
commander.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
I’ll send out a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand
Loose Immortals and give every contestant a chance to try to command
them in a formation,” the Xia Emperor said. “The nine Celestial
Immortals who control the formation with the greatest amount of skill
and allow it to unleash the most power will become the nine
commanders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing his words,
Ning and the others all felt persuaded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To let those who were
able to unleash the most power from the formation become the
commanders was quite fair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nine final
commanders shall be taught the most important aspects of the Heaven
Punisher Formation,” the Xia Emperor said. “Without those parts,
the formation can still be used, but the power will only be
comparable to some other ancient formations. With those important
parts…the power will be increased tens of times over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This formation was a
secret of the Primordial Imperial Clan; the important parts to it
naturally could not be taught to just anyone and everyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bamboo slip after
another was delivered to the tables of the Celestial Immortals. The
many Celestial Immortals all pored their coresense into the bamboo
slips, easily acquiring the Heaven Punisher Formation. But of course,
actually learning it would require some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, you will
only have half a month. When the time ends, only those who have
already fully learned the Heaven Punisher Formation will have a
chance to fight over the commander positions,” the Xia Emperor
said. “Alright, everyone…hurry up and learn the Heaven Punisher
Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million Loose
Immortals were at the plaza below the Skylight Palace, all seated in
the lotus position as they focused on learning the basics of the
Heaven Punisher Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the many
Celestial Immortals, they remained at the main hall of the Skylight
Palace. They, too, sat in the lotus position as they meditated on the
Heaven Punisher Formation. Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Celestial Immortal Unity,
Immortal Diancai…all of them quietly sat there, meditating.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 - No Seam Left Untouched
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
nine days passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more than ten
thousand Celestial Immortals remained seated in the lotus position
within the main hall of the Skylight Palace. Around each of them
hovered bloody runic seals. The same was true for Ji Ning; there were
many bloody runes swirling around him, each of which contained a
shocking battle-intent. However, it seemed as though those runes were
lacking in something. They continuously circled around Ning…and
finally, after Ning manifested yet another rune, all of the bloody
runes connected to each other, forming a complete whole as their
warlike aura skyrocketed in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
opened his eyes, looking at the hovering runes. “This Heaven
Punisher Formation is truly mysterious and profound; it actually took
me nine full days. However, it truly is a grand formation that is
perfectly suited for combination attacks; it truly lives up to its
reputation as a formation created by True God Xingtian, known as the
Primordial Wargod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xingtian was often
referred to as the Primordial Wargod. He delighted in battle. When he
made his breakthrough to become a True God, it was when his head had
been chopped off and he had transformed his nipples into eyes and his
belly button into his mouth, then continued to fight. From this, one
could tell how savage and how warlike Xingtian was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
surroundings. Immortal Diancai and Yu Wei were both meditating, but
Celestial Immortal Unity’s seat was empty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unity has already
mastered it?” Ning rose to his feet as well. The Skylight Palace
was currently quite silent; everyone was busy meditating. As for the
Xia Emperor and the other five True Immortals and Empyrean Gods, they
had left for now; the Xia Emperor and the others couldn’t just sit
there and do nothing for half a month, after all. Ning moved towards
the outside of the main palace, soon seeing the Celestial Immortals
floating on the clouds outside, chatting and laughing amongst
themselves. Ning saw a total of sixty individuals; apparently, these
were the ones who had succeeded in learning the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one had a very high
level of comprehension abilities, one would be capable of learning
the Heaven Punisher Formation. But of course, if one had a very high
level of insight into the Dao or an extremely deep level of insight
into formations, one could also learn it in an incredibly short
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth mastered it as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why we
were able to learn it so quickly was because we’ve lived for
trillions of years. Fellow Daoist Darknorth’s comprehension
abilities are truly staggering,” the other Celestial Immortals
laughed and praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled in
acknowledgmenet. These sixty Celestial Immortals were elites; in
fact, quite a few were comparable to Celestial Immortal Unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Unity
walked over as well. “I just finished learning it a short while
ago; you were just a hair slower than me. It seems you’ll be one of
my major foes when it comes to competing for the commander
positions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t praise me,
fellow Daoist Unity.” Ning shook his head. “The world of the
Grand Xia is filled with crouching tigers and hidden dragons; it
won’t be easy to rank in the top nine out of more than ten thousand
Celestial Immortals. Oh, right; there’s something I need to speak
to the Xia Emperor about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Unity nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately walked
towards a nearby attendant, asking him to carry a message for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go notify the
Xia Emperor right away. Immortal Darknorth, please wait a moment.”
The attendant immediately departed to go report to the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A side palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
seated by himself before a table that was covered with a map of the
entire Grand Xia. The Xia Emperor was staring intently at the map as
the black-robed Ning walked in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There you are.”
The Xia Emperor raised his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, Imperial Majesty.” Ning bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to stand on
such ceremony in private,” the Xia Emperor said with a laugh. “You
asked to see me in private; is there something you need?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said,
“Ji Ning has a boon to request, Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” the Xia
Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Ji Ning
knows that the Three Realms are currently in a state of chaos, and so
all Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals must take part in the
battle. However…I would like to ask you, your Imperial Majesty, to
help me and allow my Dao-companion, Yu Wei, to refrain from taking
part in battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Refrain from taking
part in battle? But…” The Xia Emperor frowned. “Why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Dao-companion is
pregnant,” Ning explained. “If she takes too heavy a blow during
a battle…she might be able to recover, as a Celestial Immortal, but
the baby in her body might…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
instantly laughed. “So the Rainbowflame Fairy is pregnant? Why
didn’t you tell me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very few people know
about it; after all, it’s just a pregnancy,” Ning said. Ning
hadn’t made a big fuss about this, primarily because he was worried
that others would take aim at Yu Wei. Thus, only the closest people
to them knew about this matter. However, after Ning’s Primaltwin’s
tribulation, his master Subhuti had told him that so long as he told
a second person about his secrets, there was a chance the Seamless
Gate would find out. Thus, Ning understood that most likely the
Seamless Gate already knew about Yu Wei’s pregnancy; this naturally
made him feel even more cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. Since
she’s pregnant, we naturally won’t ask the Rainbowflame Fairy to
take part in battle,” the Xia Emperor said. “However…after she
finishes giving birth, she still has to take part in the war. No one
can easily escape the flames of war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
someone came in from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As though sensing the
person, Ning glanced backwards. He immediately said, “Respectful
greetings to you, senior Dongyan.” The newcomer was True Immortal
Dongyan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Dongyan
laughed. “I heard, Ji Ning, that you had woken up from your
meditations, and so I wanted to chat with you. I didn’t expect you
to be here with his Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask what you
wish of me, senior?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I simply wish to ask
you to help me with something,” True Immortal Dongyan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help you?” Ning
was surprised. “Senior, you are far more powerful than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Dongyan
shook his head. “What use is that? In the face of this great storm,
even major powers might fall. I was thinking…in the event of my
death, I would like to ask you, Ji Ning, to help me out a little in
taking care of and protecting Ninelotus. You don’t have to
personally watch over her and protect her, just…help arrange for
her protection. All I ask is that she be able to stay alive and
safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Ninelotus?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had severed his
relationship with Ninelotus long ago. However…within the demonheart
world, the two of them had been together for thirty thousand years.
This had a significant impact on Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I have the power
to protect her, I naturally will. Ninelotus is my senior
apprentice-sister, after all,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I need are these
words from you, Ji Ning.” True Immortal Dongyan sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dongyan, you are far
too cautious,” the Xia Emperor said. “You became a Pure Yang True
Immortal long ago, but always misguided others about it through your
Primaltwin. Now that the storm has come and you are unable to avoid
it, you’ve already sent all of your clansmen to your master’s
place…and yet, you still want to ask Ji Ning to help out as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
surprised by these words. So the real Dongyan Forefather had become a
Pure Yang True Immortal long ago. The Celestial Immortal everyone had
met…had merely been a Primaltwin?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If one’s power is
revealed, then one will die all the quicker when the storm comes.”
True Immortal Dongyan shook his head. “Right, Xiamang. Of the
eleven thousand Celestial Immortals…I imagine some are traitors for
the Seamless Gate. If a traitor becomes one of the nine commanders…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, looking
towards the Xia Emperor as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course there are
traitors. That’s obvious…but what can you do about it?” The Xia
Emperor shook his head. “The traitors are far too hard to discern;
they can even swear oaths to the Dao of the Heavens without being
punished for breaking them. Many have made it all the way to the
sides of our Daofathers. I imagine that the traitors we’ve
uncovered only make up a small portion of all the traitors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve made it to
the sides of our Daofathers? They won’t be punished for violating
oaths to the Dao of the Heavens?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor looked
towards Ning, then nodded. “Right. You are still quite weak; your
main goal right now is to train to prepare for the Empyrean
Tribulation and become an Empyrean God. Thus, there are many things
which your master has probably not informed you about. Once you do
become an Empyrean God, you’ll know all these things. The Seamless
Gate…their abilities are beyond what you can imagine. The Seamless
Gate, the Seamless Gate…in terms of their intelligence abilities
and their infiltrating abilities…they truly do leave no seam
untouched!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shivered. Puzzled,
he asked, “But why is it that they can violate oaths to the Dao of
the Heavens? That makes no sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why doesn’t it
make sense? Daofathers have all mastered Heavenly Daos and are in
control of them; oaths to the Dao of the Heavens are useless when
made by them,” the Xia Emperor said. “Since oaths to the Dao of
the Heavens are useless when made by Daofathers…naturally, there
are others for whom they are useless as well. However, not just
anyone is capable of this…but clearly, the Seamless Gate is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are able to
know of every single Celestial Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are able to
ignore oaths to the Dao of the Heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They even number
amongst their ranks disciples of the leaders of the Daoist Path and
the Buddhist Sangha!” The Xia Emperor sighed. “The two leaders of
the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Sangha possess unfathomable
abilities; they were able to detect some flaws and identify some
traitors. However…those ones they found most likely only make up a
tiny fraction of the total number of traitors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor sighed
again. “Thus…this is a true ‘tribulation’ for the Three
Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even people like his
master, Subhuti, were behaving with the utmost caution. The Seamless
Gate…it was far too mysterious, and its abilities were far too
unfathomable. In fact, Ning had the feeling that it was as though the
Seamless Gate was in control of the laws of Heaven and Earth! They
were able to locate any Celestial Tribulation, and oaths to the Dao
of the Heavens was useless to them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will naturally be
very, very cautious in choosing the nine commanders,” the Xia
Emperor said. “No matter what, I cannot let one of those positions
enter the hands of a traitor. However…although there might be a few
traitors amongst the eleven thousand, the chances of one of them
becoming the top nine are quite low. I’ll be extremely careful in
my investigations, and if I detect anything out-of-place at all, I’ll
immediately apprehend them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the fifteen days
given to the Celestial Immortals to meditate on the Heaven Punisher
Formation came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skylight Palace.
The main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
seated high up on his throne, staring down at his subjects. Smiling,
he said, “Fellow Immortals, the fifteen days have passed. I trust
that you have all mastered at least the ‘advanced scroll’ of the
Heaven Punisher Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Celestial
Immortals present laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Punisher
Formation was divided into the ‘basic’ level, the ‘advanced’
level, and the ‘complete’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The basic level was for
Loose Immortals to learn. It was very simple, and even Loose
Immortals would only need a single day to learn it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Learning the ‘advanced’
level was a bit tougher, but for Celestial Immortals…even the
slowest of them would only need two days to master it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mastering the complete
Heaven Punisher Formation, however, was thousands of times more
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those of you who
have mastered the complete Heaven Punisher Formation, come to the
center of the palace,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One person after
another began to rise to their feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Celestial
Immortal Unity rose to their feet as well, walking to the center. An
entire group of Celestial Immortals now stood at the heart of the
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of 359.”
The Xia Emperor laughed. “If there was one more, we would have a
perfect 360 degree circle. Still…perfection is rare in this world.
My 359 fellow Immortals…I’d like to ask you to make your
preparations now. In two hours, I will have each of you attempt to
command a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose
Immortals in assuming the Heaven Punisher Formation. I’ll test the
power of the Heaven Punisher Formations you command, and the most
powerful nine will become the nine commanders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial plaza
below the palace. More than a million Loose Immortals were gathered
here; one truly could see no end to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the Loose
Immortals had all parted, allowing for an empty area with a
circumference of a thousand kilometers appear amongst them. At the
edges around this empty area, there stood more than eleven thousand
Celestial Immortals as well as the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One thousand
Celestial Immortals, a hundred thousand Loose Immortals, enter the
field!” The Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pre-selected
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals flew into the empty field in
an awe-inspiring manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Immortal
Northstar shall be the first one,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Northstar immediately said respectfully, “Yes.” He stepped into
the empty region, and as he did, a blurry aura of light instantly
covered the field, forming into an enormous grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Chaos_Goldstone"></A>
Chapter 5 - Chaos Goldstone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
million Loose Immortals watched from outside the grand sealing
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation,
this quite famous Immortal Northstar, dressed in stellar Daoist
robes, gave an order to the thousand Celestial Immortals and hundred
thousand Loose Immortals next to him: “I’ll have to trouble you
all, fellow Daoists…assemble the formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh!!! A thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose
Immortals all flew into the air in unison. When the Xia Emperor had
selected them, he had also assigned them each a location within the
grand formation. In truth, it was quite simple; each Celestial
Immortal controlled a hundred Loose Immortals, who would do whatever
the Celestial Immortal ordered. The thousand Celestial Immortals, in
turn, followed the lead of Immortal Northstar; thus, the Heaven
Punisher Formation was quite stable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals all
hovered there in midair…and then bloody runes began to emerge from
their bodies, causing a shockingly powerful warlike aura to emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blood-red aura
suddenly burst out of the grand sealing formation, but it didn’t
damage it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless lines of
bloody red light began to converge, merging together to form a
dark-red giant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…the colors
of the world seemed to change!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous whirlpool
appeared in the air above the entire imperial capital. It spread more
than a million kilometers, ravenously drawing in all of the
surrounding natural energy. In almost the blink of an eye, a
completely void of a million kilometers was created; all of the
energy in that region had been drawn into the sealing formation, into
the blurry giant’s body. Instantly, the blurry form of the giant
began to stabilize.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant was thirty
thousand meters tall, and he looked like he had an absolutely
enormous head, as well as a pair of muscular arms and powerful legs!
However…if one took a careful look, one would see that the massive
head was actually the giant’s entire upper torso! The nipples were
the eyes, while the belly button was the mouth. The entire upper body
was like a giant, savage, snarling face that had a vague resemblance
to Celestial Immortal Northstar’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is Xingtian,
the Heaven Punisher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand and one
Celestial Immortals, along with a hundred thousand Loose Immortals,
were all located within the body of this Heaven Punisher. The
enormous Heaven Punisher, formed from the energy of the surrounding
area, had an aura of such power that it surpassed the aura of most
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It looks strong, but
it’s power is rather hollow,” Celestial Immortal Unity evaluated.
“Clearly, the enormous amount of natural energy hasn’t been
applied perfectly; a bit is leaking out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to
perfectly control such an enormous amount of natural energy is too
difficult. Even the most powerful of Celestial Immortals can only do
their best.” Ning could see and sense how massive this
concentration of power was. If someone was capable of controlling all
of this power with absolute perfection…even Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals would have no choice but to flee in the face of it! Alas,
even a Pure Yang True Immortal controlling the formation wouldn’t
be able to perfectly control it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Immortal
Northstar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
located outside the formation, spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Xia
Emperor appeared out of nowhere. The white-robed Xia Emperor walked
towards the grand sealing formation, which didn’t impede him in the
slightest, allowing him to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Northstar
Heaven Punisher called out respectfully to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Punisher’s
entire body was dark-red. He was only clad in furs which covered his
waist and his groin. A blood-red aura radiated from his entire
massive body; it was the manifestation of his warlike intent, made
corporeal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First familiarize
yourself a bit first,” the white-robed Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
Northstar Heaven Punisher said respectfully. Natural energy continued
to ripple over the body of the massive Heaven Punisher, slowly
stabilizing as the Heaven Punisher’s form grew more solid. The aura
emanating from it, however, actually shrank considerably…but then,
everything came to a halt. Clearly, this Heaven Punisher was unable
to strengthen any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor nodded. “Prepare.” He waved his hand, and an enormous
pile of black rocks suddenly appeared, stacked up on each other in
neat layers like a small mountain. However, hints of golden light
could be seen from within the black rocks, causing them to have a
mysterious aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is chaos
goldstone,” the white-robed Xia Emperor said. “There are a total
of ten pieces piled up here. Use your full power to chop down upon
the stones here with your palm. The more power your Heaven Punisher
is able to split open, the more stones you will be able to split
open. The other fellow Immortals who command the Heaven Punisher
Formation will also be assigned the task of splitting these stones
open.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos goldstones?
But we haven’t been taught the critical components to the Heaven
Punisher Formation yet; will we be able to break them open?”
Celestial Immortal Unity, located outside the formation, was a bit
worried now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to say.” Ning
wasn’t certain either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He naturally knew a bit
about chaos goldstones. The Fifth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]
required many Five Elements treasures, and chaos goldstones could be
used to satisfy the ‘metal’ element requirements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods and
Daofathers harvested them from the infinite primordial chaos. They
were incredibly tough, and generally speaking only Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals were capable of damaging them. For Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, the value of chaos goldstones lay in the fact that if
one refined them, one would be able to extract chaos gold essence
from them. The stones were completely black, but their surface
glimmered with faint dots of golden light. These dots of golden light
were ‘chaos gold essence’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These ten enormous
pieces of chaos goldstone, nearly three thousand meters long…if one
refined and smelted them, the amount of chaos gold essence that would
be produced would most likely be the size of a human fingernail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos gold essence was
something which even True Gods and Daofathers would find hard to
damage. It could only be used in smelting and forging if one had very
special forging equipment and special techniques to melt them. They
were truly top-grade ingredients, generally used in the most
top-grade of Pure Yang artifacts. If one mixed in just a little chaos
gold essence into those artifacts, they would become nigh
indestructible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin,” the
white-robed Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million Immortals
outside the formation watched as the Northstar Heaven Punisher raised
his enormous palm. That massive palm was like a giant axe, the edge
becoming the axe-blade as it chopped straight downwards! Ripples in
space appeared in the area around his palm, pushing out in two
opposite directions. However, his power was clearly still being held
back; otherwise, space would’ve been torn apart long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous palm
hacked straight down against the ten massive pieces of chaos
goldstone. Instantly, the entire imperial plaza trembled. However,
since this was the most stable and secure location in the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty, it wasn’t damaged in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d he do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He broke it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He broke it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He seems to have
broken four pieces!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The million Immortals
stared, all sighing in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to shatter
four pieces of chaos goldstone, despite how tough they were…it
could be said that even without knowing the critical parts to the
formation, the Northstar Heaven Punisher was definitely at the power
level of an Empyrean God or True Immortal. Ning had to admit; this
Heaven Punisher was considerably stronger than his own true body,
which had just barely reached the minimum level of power for Empyrean
Gods or True Immortals. And this was without knowing the most
important parts to the formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four pieces
shattered, some damage to the fifth piece.” The white-robed Xia
Emperor nodded. “Alright. Next shall be fellow Immortal Alltruth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand sealing
formation was temporarily dispelled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Punisher
Formation disassembled. The hundred thousand Loose Immortals and one
thousand and one Celestial Immortals all appeared. Celestial Immortal
Northstar first bowed towards the white-robed Xia Emperor, then
walked out of the grand sealing formation. As he did, a tall, skinny,
ashen-faced elder walked into the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the 359
Celestial Immortals had a chance to test themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first testee,
Celestial Immortal Northstar, was actually quite formidable; most of
those who came after him were only able to break three pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Immortal
Unity.” The white-robed Xia Emperor glanced outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to give
it a try.” Unity gave Ning a smile, then walked towards the grand
sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched closely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unity was the 192nd
testee. The most powerful Celestial Immortal to date had, amazingly
enough, been able to shatter six pieces of chaos goldstone. She was a
female Immortal, Celestial Immortal Rainsoar of the Skyfarmer clan.
She was a tremendously famous pill-refining expert, but she wasn’t
particularly well-known for her combat abilities. And yet, till now
she was the most powerful person to be tested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how
Celestial Immortal Unity will do?” Yu Wei wondered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Unity’s
power is formidable,” Ning said. “I trust his results shall be
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Heaven Punisher once
more took form within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After familiarizing
himself with the technique, the Unity Heaven Punisher was given the
nod by the white-robed Xia Emperor. He, too, lifted up his massive
right palm, then hacked downwards towards the pile of chaos
goldstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Yet another,
now-familiar exploding sound. By now, most likely all of the dwellers
within the imperial capital of the grand Xia had gotten used to this
sort of explosion…because there had been nearly two hundred of them
by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a careful
look, only to see that only four pieces of the ten chaos goldstones
remained undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six pieces!” Ning
called out in delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly is
formidable. He’s comparable to Celestial Immortal Rainsoar.” Yu
Wei was surprised and delighted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly formidable.
Impressive!” Immortal Diancai was excited as well. There were so
many Celestial Immortals here, quite a few of whom were almost as
powerful as Pure Yang True Immortals. However, it truly was hard to
say which of them would be able to unleash the most power from the
Heaven Punisher Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The million Immortals
all sighed in praise as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation,
the white-robed Xia Emperor nodded. “Six shattered pieces, with the
seventh piece slightly damaged. You are very close to fellow Immortal
Rainsoar; you are just a tiny bit weaker. You rank second amongst the
192 fellow Immortals who have tested so far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation
dispersed, allowing Celestial Immortal Unity to fly out. A look of
delight was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To rank second amongst
192 Celestial Immortals meant that he had a very good chance of
ranking in the top nine of the 359 total Celestial Immortals. But of
course, it was also possible that he was just unlucky, and that the
later figures would all be incredibly powerful. If that was the case,
there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Celestial Immortal
after another went forward as the tests continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why isn’t it your
turn yet, junior apprentice-brother?” Yu Wei was getting a bit
impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. There will
always be some who come first and some who come later,” Ning said.
The Xia Emperor most likely had a very high opinion of Ning, which
was why he had put Ning towards the rear, as part of a grand finale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, more than three
hundred Celestial Immortals had made their tests. A total of five
Celestial Immortals had shattered six pieces of chaos goldstone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Immortal Ji
Ning, please step forward,” the white-robed Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth,
Ji Ning? Supposedly, his true body was, at the Void level, capable of
resisting nine mighty Celestial Immortals by himself. He’s the
disciple of a Daofather…and by the looks of it, his Primaltwin has
overcome the tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was actually
watching Ji Ning during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. He truly is
a monstrously talented genius. However…fellow Doaist Ji Ning has
trained for a fairly short period of time. I don’t know if he’s
capable of controlling this Heaven Punisher Formation well or not.”
The plaza was immediately filled with discussions regarding Ning;
after all, Ning was quite well known amongst the ten thousand-plus
Celestial Immortals. As they saw it, perhaps Ji Ning wasn’t
particularly strong right now, but in the future he would probably
surpass them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists,
thank you for your help,” Ning said towards the thousand Celestial
Immortals and hundred thousand Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately soared
upwards, flying into the air as a thousand Celestial Immortals
followed him, scattering all around him. As for the hundred thousand
Loose Immortals, they in turn followed their respective Celestial
Immortal leaders. An enormous number of bloody runes appeared, all of
which began to gather together and form into a blurry, dark-red
giant. The surrounding natural energy began to furiously flow towards
them. An enormous, thirty thousand meter tall Heaven Punisher quickly
took shape, one whose face was rather similar to Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This feeling…such
tremendous power…” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flood of power
flowing through him was beyond what he could truly control. All he
could do was to try and control it as best he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Immortal Ji
Ning, familiarize yourself with it first.” The white-robed Xia
Emperor smiled.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - Becoming Generals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every Loose Immortal
was very weak, but the amount of natural energy a hundred thousand
Loose Immortals could summon…finally, Ji Ning had a taste of it for
himself. Even though a thousand Celestial Immortals were guiding and
taming the energy, making it so that it wasn’t too unruly or
chaotic, Ning still could sense how tough it would be to control it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Controlling the
power of the Heaven Punisher Formation is like controlling the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation].” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Greater Thousand
Swords Formation]…the more Immortal swords one used, the more
difficult it was to control the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was especially
true now that Ning used nine top-grade Pure Yang flying swords, the
Ananda World-Swords, as the heart of his [Greater Thousand Swords
Formation]. Although his heartforce was incredibly powerful, which
was of use to him in controlling these magic treasures…Ning was
still only able to just barely activate the first level of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main reason for
this was that those nine Ananda World-Swords were simply far, far too
powerful. It must be understood that not even most Pure Yang True
Immortals would be lucky enough to acquire such a complete set of
top-grade Pure Yang swords. Thus, one could imagine how hard it was
to control them! The only reason why Ning was able to do so despite
being merely at the Celestial Immortal level was because his
heartforce had reached the third stage, ‘ruler’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning hadn’t
yet learned the way to apply heartforce to his soul, the more
powerful one’s heartforce was, the more flying swords one could
control. This was similar to an unskilled strongman wielding a sword;
the stronger he was, the heavier his sword could be. The application
of heartforce to the soul was like a matter of technique; with the
proper technique, the strongman would be able to wield even heavier
swords, while also allowing the power of his sword-arts to
explosively increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the difference
a good technique could make.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning was
completely relying on his heartforce to brute-force things for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. A flood of
energy circulated throughout the Heaven Punisher as Ning took control
over it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He slowly grew familiar
with its power and gained experience wit it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it really
wasn’t that different from controlling one of his sword-formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor put away the earlier, shattered chaos goldstones, then placed
ten more undamaged pieces on the ground. The chaos goldstones all
glimmered with golden light, filled with beauty and magnetism.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can begin.”
After watching Ning familiarize himself for a few moments, the
white-robed Xia Emperor gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth Heaven
Punisher took a single step forward, lifting up his thick, powerful
right arm. The attention of the million-plus Immortals located
outside the formation was all focused on this massive arm, many
thousands of meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous palm
hacked down like a massive greataxe, chopping downwards with
irresistible might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like Pangu
splitting open the cosmic egg of primordial chaos and establishing
the universe. Spatial ripples appeared around the palm, pushing out
in two directions like waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous, dark-red
axe-hand carried awe-inspiring might as it chopped downwards like a
hatchet towards the mountain of chaos goldstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous collision,
followed by a shockwave that blasted out in every direction. When the
shockwave struck against the grand sealing formation, a series of
booming sounds could be heard. When the million-plus Immortals
outside the formation heard those sounds, they were all tremendously
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This level of
power…it’s definitely the strongest thus far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning truly
is extraordinary. Monster. What a monster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
pieces of chaos goldstone he broke apart?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals all
sighed in amazement. In their hearts, Ji Ning truly was a peerless
monster. They had thought that he wouldn’t necessarily be that
impressive in commanding the Heaven Punisher Formation, but who
would’ve thought that he had most likely surpassed all of the
Celestial Immortals who had come before him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all took a careful
look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shockwaves
dispersed. Only now could they see…that the mountain of chaos
goldstone was an absolute mess. There were so many shattered pieces
of stone that they couldn’t even tell how many were broken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…eight
pieces?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe nine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The million-plus
Immortals tried their best to discern how many pieces there were, but
found it hard because so many shattered bits of rocks were
obstructing their view.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor waved his hand, and instantly all of the shattered bits flew
to one side, revealing a completely undamaged piece of chaos
goldstone as well as a second piece that was covered with cracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight pieces
shattered, the ninth piece nearly completely shattered.” The
white-robed Xia Emperor revealed a smile. “Fellow Immortal Ji Ning
truly is formidable; you’ve already become number one amongst the
330 Immortals who have tested thus far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, the
white-robed Xia Emperor sighed to himself. “Ji Ning truly is
incredible. For Celestial Immortals, using the Heaven Punisher
Formation to break six pieces of chaos goldstone should be their
limit. Only an inconceivable monster like Ji Ning could release such
extraordinary power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From six pieces to
eight pieces…there was ‘only’ an increase of two pieces, true,
but the power of the palm-blow was being ablated with each layer.
This meant that Ning’s Heaven Punisher’s power was two entire
levels above that of the other Heaven Punishers. This…was because
of heartforce! His powerful heartforce allowed him to control more of
the natural energy of Heaven and Earth. If he had fully mastered
heartforce and applied it to his soul, he would’ve been able to
control an even more astonishing amount of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth Heaven
Punisher completely vanished, revealing a thousand and one Celestial
Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose Immortals. Ning immediately
flew out then said with a smile, “Thank you, fellow Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” the
white-robed Xia Emperor laughed, “Unless something unexpected
happens, you’ll be one of the nine generals. But of course…if
nine of the remaining twenty-nine are more powerful than you, then
there’s nothing for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that really is
the case, it would be a blessing for our Grand Xia,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor laughed
loudly, then said, “Alright. Next is fellow Immortal Dustfloat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person who came
after Ning, Immortal Dustfloat, actually startled everyone quite
badly…because he was able to just barely succeed in smashing the
seventh piece of chaos goldstone. This caused many Immortals to feel
shocked; could it be that there really was a group of incredibly
powerful Celestial Immortals located at the end, some of whom would
surpass Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…as time
passed and the tests proceeded, they quickly saw that although the
Xia Emperor had indeed arranged for some of the particularly famous
and powerful Celestial Immortals to be placed towards the end, none
of them were more powerful than Ji Ning. In fact, none of them were
even as powerful as Celestial Immortal Dustfloat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trials for the 359
Celestial Immortals took a total of two days, ending by nightfall of
the second day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ranking was:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 - Celestial Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning <BR> 2 - Celestial Immortal Dustfloat <BR> 3 -
Celestial Immortal Loachwater <BR> 4 - Celestial Immortal Rainsoar <BR>
5 - Celestial Immortal Allbeasts <BR> 6 - Celestial Immortal Unity <BR>
7 - Celestial Immortal Rainbow <BR> 8 - Celestial Immortal Thousand
Needles <BR> 9 - Celestial Immortal Whacko
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was actually quite
strange. Ning had shattered eight plates of chaos goldstone, while
Celestial Immortal Dustfloat had shattered seven. The rest of the
nine had shattered six pieces, while the tenth had shattered five
pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These thousand
Celestial Immortals and hundred thousand Loose Immortals shall be
commanded by fellow Immortal Whacko; they shall be the ‘Whacko
Army’.” The Xia Emperor began to assign responsibilities. Upon
hearing the name, quite a few of Immortals were unable to control
their laughter; this army’s name didn’t have any hint of an
Immortal’s aura at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These next thousand
Celestial Immortals and hundred thousand Loose Immortals shall be
commanded by fellow Immortal Thousand Needles; they shall be the
Thousand Needles Army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These next thousand
Celestial Immortals and hundred thousand Loose Immortals shall be
commanded by fellow Immortal Darknorth; they shall be the Darknorth
Army. Alright; the nine armies have been set. The remaining Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals shall be under my command,” the Xia
Emperor said. “Nine generals, come with me. All other Immortals,
you can go rest with your fellows in the same army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
immediately flew away on a cloud towards the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five True Immortals
followed him, as did Ning and the rest of the nine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a graceful hall
inside the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit, all of you.”
The Xia Emperor sat down with a smile. Everyone else sat down as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five True Immortals
were naturally seated closest to the Xia Emperor. Next was Ji Ning
and the rest of the nine, who seated themselves in accordance with
their ranking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
critical parts to the Heaven Punisher Formation. Hurry up and learn
them. Meditate well.” The Xia Emperor waved his hand, and instantly
nine dark-red medallions flew towards Ning and the other eight. “True
God Xingtian personally forged these, imprinting his technique within
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These medallions were
the size of a palm. They were dark red, and covered with a
savage-looking diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine medallions
hovered in the air in front of Ning and the rest of the nine. They
naturally reached out to grab them, then filled them with their
coresense. Soon, they completely memorized all of the information
contained within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can keep the
medallions.” The Xia Emperor sighed. “All of you have fearlessly
volunteered to command my many Immortals to do battle against the
Seamless Gate…if you manage to survive, you can use the medallion
to go visit True God Xingtian, and pick a single technique of your
choice from his Dao Repository. Alternately, you can choose any Pure
Yang treasure or Protocosmic spirit-treasure from his treasury.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained quite
calm, but the other Celestial Immortals began to feel the fires of
desire blaze in their hearts. After all, none of them were a
Daofather’s disciple; there were many divine abilities and secret
arts which they did not have access to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meditate well,”
the Xia Emperor repeated, his gaze dark and gloomy. “I fear that
not too long from now, the Seamless Gate will launch the war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Whitepole Commandery was a very remote commandery. Generally
speaking, the more remote a feof was, the larger in size it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was nightfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous, towering
black citadel was hovering in the air above Whitepole City. The
levitating black citadel was a full size larger than even Whitepole
City itself. It was completely black, and around it hovered a large
number of chains. These countless chains filled the space around it,
seeming to lock the citadel here as an anchor kept a ship locked in
place in the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the black
citadel were filled with many roving black-armored soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the citadel
itself, there was a tightly-patrolled military headquarters, as well
as some towering palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The largest open area
within the black citadel was covered with a veritable sea of
Immortals, all seated in the lotus position. These were Loose
Immortals, and one could see no end to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very front of
the plaza, there were three enormous, fog-shrouded caverns that were
three hundred meters tall. The dark cavern entrances led to a
mysterious, terrifying location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s said that
those caves lead to the legendary ‘Fifth World’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch said
that the Celestial Immortals within the Fifth World are numerous
beyond measure. There’s even many True Immortals and Empyrean Gods
there. If the Fifth World released its full power, it would
effortlessly wipe out the entire Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So why don’t
they?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supposedly, the
Fifth World is battling against many major worlds right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Loose
Immortals were all secretly chatting with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the tallest
tower of the levitating black citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of Celestial
Immortals were seated in the lotus position within this palace.
Black, watery runes were emanating from their bodies as they quietly,
calmly meditated and trained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very front of
this palace sat the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate, Azurefox, as
well as the other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. There were a
total of eight of them! The Seamless Gate alone had four, whereas the
Myriad Demons Cavern and Bloodcloud Hall had thus far only produced
their respective leaders, their other experts having yet to arrive.
True Immortal Whitepole, a white-browed, icy-looking man, was also
present, along with a black-robed, black-haired, red-eyed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After many years of
subterfuge and decades of instigations…nearly three thousand
Celestial Immortals of the Grand Xia have joined us,” Gatemaster
Azurefox said with a smile. “We now have three thousand more, while
Xiamang has three thousand less; that means the balance has been
shifted by six thousand. Our Seamless Gate is also gathering in some
scattered pockets of power located throughout our other major worlds
as well. Once these three thousand Celestial Immortals have mastered
the ‘True Art of Chaoswater’, it will be time to launch the
assault. Senior apprentice-brother Whitepole, we’ll rely on your
leadership.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been waiting
countless eons for this day,” the white-browed True Immortal
Whitepole said in a cold voice.

“Everyone has tasks to accomplish. If someone makes a mistake…don’t
blame me when I report it to Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Whitepole, don’t worry; the conquest of the Grand Xia is the most

Myriad Demons Cave said. “None of us will slack off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, don’t

as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior

must conquer the Grand Xia!” Gatemaster Azurefox chimed in as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
nodded lightly. “Good. Since Master has assigned me to lead the
conquest of the Grand Xia…I truly do not wish to lose. I’m going
to win this battle, even if it costs me my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven True
Immortals/Empyrean Gods all exchanged glances, murmuring to
themselves in secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
was indeed very powerful…but he was excessively stubborn. The feud
he had with the Xia Emperor wasn’t a small one, but it wasn’t a
major one either. Generally speaking, Pure Yang True Immortals were
broad-minded and would long ago forget about such a feud. True
Immortal Whitepole, however, insisted on remembering it, and had even
bided his time for so long. As soon as the Godking had whispered to
him, he had been so narrow-minded and laser-focused on revenge that
he had immediately joined the Godking. He had trained bitterly for
countless years, and was now incredibly powerful. Although those in
the outside world didn’t know exactly how powerful he was,
Gatemaster Azurefox and the others did. In addition, this man had
fortified Whitepole City to a nigh-impregnable level, and was also
extremely skilled in biding his time; he was indeed an excellent
choice as commander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The conquest of the
Grand Xia was incredibly important, and so the Godking had assigned
this mission to True Immortal Whitepole, ordering Gatemaster
Azurefox, the Cavemaster, and the Hallmaster to act as his
assistants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A world of fiery red
flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Massive, towering
figures were striding about on the surface of this world. Some of
them were three thousand meters tall, while others were thirty
thousand meters tall! Their appearances were all varied and
different; some had eight arms, some had three heads, while some
looked like beasts. They were all filled with massive, billowing
amounts of divine power, using it to block the terrible heat of this
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life really is
wonderful these days,” a green-haired cyclopean giant said with a
sigh as he sat there on the scorching ground. Although the scorching
heat of the ground was causing his skin to crackle, he still had a
look of contentment on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor has
imprisoned us for countless years, and has been torturing us all this
time. Why has he stopped recently?” A nearby red-haired giant
asked, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
environment remained a terrible one, things were far better than they
had been in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing heat, the
lava-like ground…these were all minor matters. It must be
understood that a few decades before this, each and every one of them
regularly underwent torture that caused their bodies to break apart.
Fortunately, however, their Fiendgod bodies were able to heal from
it, but even so…it was a life worse than death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Compared to that, life
was currently quite comfortable indeed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above this
world, a massive spatial hole suddenly appeared. From within the
spatial hole emerged a muscular, black-robed human figure. It was the
Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
countless Fiendgods within this vast area all raised their heads. All
their gazes were focused upon the Xia Emperor.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the Xia
Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell have
you come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, have you
come to humiliate us some more?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless furious roars
rang out from throughout the land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor stood there in the air, staring down at the countless
Fiendgods. Long ago, during the Fiendgod Era, the humans had won a
great victory. Many ordinary cultivators believed the defeated
Fiendgods to have been slain, but in reality, only a small number of
them actually had; most had instead been imprisoned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
Youngflame clan had imprisoned some as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once properly tamed,
these Fiendgods would become loyal servants that would live for
countless years; they had unlimited lifespans! Who would be willing
to so casually kill such potentially useful servants?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others had relocated here from Pangu’s World, after all; they held
enormous advantages over these local Fiendgods. At first, they had
slowly and patiently collected and tamed the local Fiendgods, until
one day the local Fiendgods had given birth to an Empyrean God. The
humans hadn’t dared to be negligent, and so had joined forces to
completely suppress the Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few top-tier clans
had been given a few Fiendgods, but 99% of the captured Fiendgods had
all been imprisoned by the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless years of
torment had indeed caused a portion of the Fiendgods to submit; the
four Void-level Fiendgods that guarded the imperial gates for the Xia
Emperor were good examples! The unbowed Fiendgods, however, made up
the vast majority…and the Empyrean God was one of them. And so,
they had remained imprisoned here by the Xia Emperor for this entire
period of time! Logically speaking, an Empyrean God would be
considered a powerful expert of the Three Realms, and so Empyrean
Gods would generally only be imprisoned for a short period of time;
it was quite rare to see one be imprisoned for so long. Fortunately
for the Xia Emperor, his status was quite special, and the Empyrean
God in question hadn’t had any backers, which was why the Xia
Emperor had been able to keep him here for so long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“XIAMANG!!!” A
furious roar rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering,
mountain-like figure soared into the skies. The figure had long,
unbound hair and radiated an aura of infinite cold. His eyes flashed
with jade-green light, and his upper body was completely unclad; the
only thing he wore was a fur loincloth. He stood there coldly in
midair, staring angrily at the Xia Emperor. “Why have you come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One on one…not even
he was a match for the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there was a
veritable ocean of Fiendgods here, and yet…although logically
speaking, their power should’ve been able to completely swamp the
Xia Emperor, they were in a prison world that was actually a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure. As the master of this treasure, the Xia
Emperor didn’t even have to fight against them; all he had to do
was activate the might of the treasure, and all of the Fiendgods
would suffer pain that would make them wish for death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Coldsavage, have you been enjoying life lately?” The black-robed
Xia Emperor laughed calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Empyrean
God Coldsavage sneered. “These little fellows have enjoyed a few
decades of comfort, and so they are all quite delighted. However,
they’ve forgotten that we Fiendgods once flew through the vast
world above. That vast world is our true world, our true land. You
outsiders, you invaders, you took away our land, you killed our
kinsmen, and you captured us and tortured us for the sake of making
us become your servants and slaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God
Coldsavage’s voice rang out throughout this fiery world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWRAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Detestable Xia
Emperor!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, countless
Fiendgods bellowed out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
remained placid. Smiling, he shook his head: “You are wrong,
ridiculously wrong. This isn’t your land. Countless years ago, the
only thing which existed was the primordial chaos. Pangu split it
apart, establishing Heaven and Earth, resulting in the creation of
the primordial Pangu’s World. Afterwards, Mother Nuwa created a
race using Pangu as the template; that race was us, the humans. We
are the heirs to Pangu and Nuwa; naturally, we are meant to flourish!
We humans rose to prominence in the Primordial Era, then became the
true powers of Pangu’s World! Afterwards, a storm came that caused
the primordial world to shatter; only then arose the three thousand
major worlds and the trillion minor worlds. And so, to be
precise…even the world of the Grand Xia is nothing more than a tiny
piece of the shattered Pangu’s World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you tell me…are
humans the owners and masters of the Grand Xia? Or are you
Fiendgods?” The black-robed Xia Emperor asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were born here
and we grew up here. Naturally, we are the owners of this place!”
Empyrean God Coldsavage roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ours! Ours!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnable humans!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Fiendgods
echoed in furious unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor said calmly, “I can’t be bothered to quibble with you
about this. The victor becomes hailed as king, while the defeated are
cursed as bandits. You have all been imprisoned here for countless
years, never to see the light of day! But now, I’ll give you a
chance…if you are willing to serve me and labor on my behalf for a
hundred thousand years, then after that period of time, I’ll give
you back your freedom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice rang out,
echoing throughout this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freedom?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Fiendgods
were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They deeply desired
freedom, but the Xia Emperor had never promised it to them a single
time, despite having imprisoned them here for countless ages.
Instead, he had always demanded that they become his eternal servants
and slaves, which was why they had never assented. And in truth,
during an ordinary era of peace, a hundred thousand years was an
extremely short period of time; to have so many Fiendgods be servants
for a mere hundred thousand years was pointless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xia Emperor, are you
deceiving us?” Empyrean God Coldsavage frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The Xia
Emperor shook his head. “I can swear an oath to the Dao of the
Heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that after
a hundred thousand years, you’ll give us our ‘freedom’, then
immediately slaughter us,” Empyrean God Coldsavage said angrily.
“Even if you don’t…other humans will act against us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed. “I told you, I’ll give you your freedom. In fact, I can
even promise that I will give you your own territory from within the
land I control, allowing you to live peaceful lives there. So long as
you do not revolt and do not act against humans, you’ll be able to
live there in peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all the
Fiendgods grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew exactly how
powerful the humans were; after all, they had seen humanity’s
‘fist’ and had tasted its formidableness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a hundred
thousand years?” Empyrean God Coldsavage said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can swear it on an
oath to the Dao of the Heavens,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine! Then I’ll
labor for you for a hundred thousand years.” Coldsavage’s eyes
gleamed with light. A mere hundred millennia; they had already been
imprisoned in this place for countless hundred millennia. For
Fiendgods, such a period of time was indeed very brief. They merely
had to temporarily endure being his servants, and then they would
gain their eternal freedom. They wouldn’t be so foolish as to
refuse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that,
the Xia Emperor took a massive army of Fiendgods into his command.
These were the Fiendgods that countless human clans had joined
together to suppress….but of course, this vast army would only
serve for a hundred thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred thousand
years. I wonder how many of them will be alive, after the storm. If
they manage to survive…I might as well grant them their freedom and
let them live happy lives.” The Xia Emperor sighed to himself. “But
I wonder…by then, will I be alive, or will I be dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. The black citadel levitating above Whitepole City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black citadel had
been personally forged by a Daofather for the express purpose of
serving as a headquarters for an army. The Nuwa Alliance referred to
it as the ‘Seamless City’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the main plaza of
the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Loose
Immortals were gathered here, before the three massive black
fog-shrouded caves that led to the Fifth World. A steady, unbroken
stream of black-robed figures flew out from the cave, as well as the
occasional blood-robed figure. They all had tremendously powerful
auras; some of them were Loose Immortals, while a few had the auras
of Celestial Immortals. This awe-inspiringly vast army caused all of
the many Loose Immortals present to feel their hearts swell with
fervor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
far too powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even more Immortals
are arriving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Joining the Seamless
Gate was the right decision.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the most
towering palace of the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Whitepole, my forces have already assembled,” the Hallmaster of
Bloodcloud Hall said with a laugh. “Just now, the last of them have
reached the Seamless City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-shaped white
eyebrows of True Immortal Whitepole danced upwards as he smiled.
“Excellent. Junior apprentice-sister Azurefox, have all three
thousand Celestial Immortals finished learning the first scroll of
the True Art of Chaoswater?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all have.”
Gatemaster Azurefox nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then it is time to
mobilize the army and campaign against the Xia.” True Immortal
Whitepole rose to his feet. “Assemble the world-notifying
formation; I am going to announce it to the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven True
Immortals/Empyrean Gods all rose as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world-notifying
formation was set up. True Immortal Whitepole stood there in its
center, staring coldly towards the vast, infinite Void. He
immediately said in a sonorous voice, “The Xia Emperor is
tyrannical and brutal, without the Dao. In the face of the storm…I,
True Immortal Whitepole, now command an army of a million Immortals
to follow the will of the Dao of the Heavens in campaigning against
the Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Whitepole’s voice reverberated throughout the 3600 commanderies and
four seas of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mortals, beasts,
Diremonsters, cultivators…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all could hear
this voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a voice that
echoed throughout every inch of the vast Grand Xia!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It represented…that
the curtains had been lifted upon a massive war between Immortals
within the Grand Xia!

Chapter 8 - Eight Dragons Cloudcity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a side hall of
the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, the
five True Immortals/Empyrean Gods, and Ji Ning and the rest of the
nine commanders were all present here. The nine had already learned
the critical components to the Heaven Punisher Formation, and had
immediately understood the secrets to the entire formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So to unleash the
full power of the Heaven Punisher Formation, one actually needs
810,000 Loose Immortals and 9000 Celestial Immortals led by one
powerful expert. Only then does it reach maximum power, and will the
Heaven Punisher reach its full, perfect power.” Celestial Immortal
Allbeasts stroked his thick beard, sighing in amazement. “Nine
represents a limit. Nine by nine, eighty one…this truly is a
perfect formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If 810,000 Loose
Immortals and 9000 Celestial Immortals were under my command, then
the power of this formation would definitely rise dramatically.”
Celestial Immortal Whacko revealed an eager look on his face as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, seated
on his throne, just laughed. “Indeed, a perfect Heaven Punisher
Formation does involve 810,000 Loose Immortals and 9000 Celestial
Immortals under a single commander. A perfect formation would allow
your Heaven Punishers to increase in power by one or two levels.
However…forget about the perfect Heaven Punisher Formation, even
the simplified one that only involves 100,000 Loose Immortals and
1000 Celestial Immortals summons more natural energy than you can
handle. In addition, there’s a limit to the number of Loose
Immortals and Celestial Immortals available to us; our Grand Xia
would only be able to produce a single perfect Heaven Punisher, but
we can make more than ten of the simple ones!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the
difference in power between the simplified and the perfect Heaven
Punishers wasn’t that great; at most, the simplified ones would be
at a disadvantage in a head-on battle. In a battle where one side was
perfectly countered by the other, such as when a Ki Refiner was
forced into close combat by a Fiendgod, the result would be a
slaughter…but when two Fiendgods fought in close combat, and there
was just a minor difference in power between the two, at most one
would be able to suppress the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A slightly stronger
Fiendgod, or ten slightly weaker Fiendgods? In a time of war…the
Xia Emperor naturally knew which one to pick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sonorous voice rang
out, shaking the world and transmitting straight into the Skylight
Palace. Or perhaps it could be said that this voice shook every
single inch of this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor is
tyrannical and brutal, without the Dao. In the face of the storm…I,
True Immortal Whitepole, now command an army of a million Immortals
to follow the will of the Dao of the Heavens in campaigning against
the Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Campaigning against
the Xia!” “Campaigning against the Xia!” “Campaigning against
the Xia!” …
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice echoed
nonstop within the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The citizens of the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia were incredibly proud figures, but
during the past half month, they had been consumed with awed
discussions regarding the countless Immortals who had entered the
imperial palace, as well as the three hundred-plus shocking
explosions that they had heard over the course of the past day and
night. They had questions…they had suspicions…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, everything had
been clearly and publicly laid out this day!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor is
tyrannical and brutal, without the Dao. In the face of the storm…I,
True Immortal Whitepole, now command an army of a million Immortals
to follow the will of the Dao of the Heavens in campaigning against
the Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A voice rang out from
the ends of the world, instantly causing all of the countless
denizens of the imperial capital to become stunned. And then…they
went berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Campaign against the
Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Whitepole? Can it be that he is a Pure Yang True Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An army of a million
Immortals? Is this real?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The citizens of the
imperial capital were all extraordinary figures; they knew that Pure
Yang True Immortals sat above Celestial Immortals in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder countless
Immortals gathered at the imperial palace. No wonder! It seems that
they are there to deal with the revolt of this True Immortal
Whitepole.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Whitepole is incredible; he’s actually able to command an army of
over a million Immortals. Immortals! And more than a million of them?
This is just…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can this ‘True
Immortal Whitepole’ be the ancestor of the Whitepole clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of
conversations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local citizens were
shocked and uneasy. However, over the course of countless years, the
imperial capital had always been safe. In addition, there had been
several marquis-led revolutions in the past, none of which had
reached the imperial capital. Thus, the local dwellers were still
filled with confident towards the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Campaign against the
Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An army of a million
Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This voice seems to
be ringing out everywhere at the same time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Whitepole? What’s a True Immortal? Can it be that there is actually
something more powerful than a Celestial Immortal? A million
Immortals…our entire sect has only a single Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder our
Flamedoor Commandery has been in such a state of chaos. It seems the
world is about to change…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every place in the vast
land of the Grand Xia, including the four seas that surrounded
it…every human, beast, Diremonster, cultivator…they all heard
these words, and they all had their own thoughts. The reference to an
‘army of a million Immortals’ caused particular astonishment and
terror. Given that the entire Grand Xia was in a state of chaos to
begin with, many mortals with limited experience thought to
themselves, “The Grand Xia is probably finished! More than a
million legendary Immortals…good heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the more
experienced individuals were terror-stricken. “Does the entire
Grand Xia even have a million Immortals in it? Hard to say. It is
going to be hard for the Grand Xia to win this battle. We might
lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone felt restless
and uneasy. These simple words had already thrown everyone into a
state of confusion and chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. A side hall in the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing these
words, the Xia Emperor’s face changed, as did the faces of the
others with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finally
begun,” Ning murmured silently to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Xia
Emperor raised his head, frowning. As the master of the Grand Xia and
a man of tremendous power, he could vaguely sense that karma and luck
were changing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the hearts of
the citizens are with us, luck shall gather here. When their hearts
are quaking, luck shall disperse,” the Xia Emperor said softly. The
hearts of the citizens could, to a certain extent, have an impact on
karmic luck. But of course, this wasn’t absolute; there were many
factors which could impact karmic luck; for example, if the Grand Xia
suddenly gave birth to ten Empyrean Gods or True Immortals, its
karmic luck would immediately increase by an explosive amount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end…what
really mattered the most was personal strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the hearts of
the citizens? That was secondary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an ordinary world of
mortals, it might be important, but this was a world of Immortals and
Fiends; power was what truly mattered. But of course, the hearts of
the citizens couldn’t be completely neglected; the more karmic luck
one had, the better. Karmic luck was simply far too important! It
impacted the amount of natural energy one could use and the chances
one had of acquiring precious treasures. For example, acquiring
Protocosmic spirit-treasures, or perhaps even the legendary Chaos
treasures that were born from the primordial chaos itself, required
tremendous amounts of luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if your
power was on the level of Nuwa, things would be different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa was the most
powerful figure of the entire Three Realms, and her luck was
indisputably the best as well. She was so powerful that she could
destroy Heaven and Earth; even if others found treasures, she could
take them away by force. Simply put, she was far too powerful…and
power made up an enormous component of ‘karmic luck’. When there
wasn’t such an enormous different in power, however, other aspects
would be more important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, it was
clear that neither the Seamless Gate nor the Nuwa Alliance had enough
power to wipe their enemies out, and so they naturally would fight
over karmic luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll make a short
trip,” the Xia Emperor said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Xia
Emperor appeared out of nowhere, then immediately left the side hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A similarly sonorous,
booming voice rang out, seeming to have descended from the very
heights of the Nine Heavens, filling every inch of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitepole, child,
years ago you were nothing more than a hound for a defeated clan; you
supinely knelt before me, quivering in abject terror. Now that you
have joined with a few other contemptible figures, you dare speak of
‘a million Immortals’ and dare rebel against me? These are my
heavens, and this is MY world. No one should even think about taking
it away. Whitepole, little boy, can it be that you have forgotten
what happened to all of the other marquises who rebelled against me?
Every single one who rebelled had their souls shattered. There have
never been any exceptions, and there never will.” The Xia Emperor’s
dominating voice was filled with a natural, exalted aura that
radiated power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First True Immortal
Whitepole’s voice, then the Xia Emperor’s voice; they came one
after the other, both shaking the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Whitepole’s voice was more callous and grim, while the Xia
Emperor’s voice carried a natural aura of command that came from
his countless years of domination over the Grand Xia, making it even
more persuasive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the voice
of the Xia Emperor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The voice of the
master of our Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that ever
since the Fiendgod Era, there’s only been a single Emperor of the
Grand Xia…him, the Xia Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless citizens
of the Grand Xia went wild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was a
legend! Even tribes of ordinary humans knew that their land was the
land of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Now, upon hearing someone say that
‘these are my heavens, and this is MY world’, they all understood
that it had to be the master of the Grand Xia Dynasty who was saying
these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there had been
marquises who rebelled in the past?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense. Even
our clan has had traitors and rebellions in our history; it’s
normal for the Grand Xia to have had rebellions as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless mortals
of the ordinary tribes all took this to mean that this was nothing
more than yet another ‘ordinary’ rebellion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their tribes were
fairly new, after all; they didn’t really understand what the
difference was between this rebellion and past ones. The Xia Emperor
had intentionally muddied the waters, and there was no way for True
Immortal Whitepole to explain the difference at all. The Xia
Emperor’s influence within the Grand Xia was simply too great; he
had ruled it for countless ages, and the subjugation his subjects
felt towards him was bone-deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor could
sense the karmic luck of the world once more gathering and
stabilizing. This was how swaying the hearts of the citizens worked;
you relied on power, and you relied on your mouth. A single mouth
could cause the hearts of the citizens to either gather behind you or
to leave you behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
black-robed Xia Emperor gave the order. “It is time for us to
battle against the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five True
Immortals/Empyrean Gods, Ji Ning, and the other eight commanders all
followed the Xia Emperor in leaving the side hall, flying out into
the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial plaza. The
eleven thousand Celestial Immortals and million Loose Immortals had
already been divided into ten brigades. Ning and the other eight
commanders would lead nine of them,, while the Xia Emperor would
control the remaining one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has already declared war.” The black-robed Xia Emperor looked
downwards, his voice booming forth. Trying to deceive these Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals was pointless, and so he said
straightforwardly, “Only one side can win in this battle. What we
need to do…is head out and completely crush them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, people began
to call out from below him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million Immortals all
called out the word ‘fight’ in unison, each of them filled with
powerful will and determination. Their voices rang out together as
they called for battle, and it seemed as though the heavens
themselves were about to collapse. It was a joint howl that seemed to
carry the power to break apart the world, filling each of the
Immortals with ardor and eagerness. Who said that Immortals were
always calm and had no emotions? In truth, it was that things would
rarely excite them to this degree!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.” The
black-robed Xia Emperor waved his hand, and a palm-sized citadel
appeared within his palm. It flew into the skies, then quickly began
to expand in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a completely
golden citadel, and it was surrounded by an enormous base of clouds.
Eight azure dragons were swimming around it, filled with
awe-inspiring power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight dragons
swimming around a city in the clouds?” Ning and the others stared
at the eight azure dragons, feeling rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine generals!”
The black-robed Xia Emperor called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Present!” Ning and
the other eight responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Command your
Immortals and enter the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,” the black-robed
Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
eight immediately flew forward, and behind them flew an awe-inspiring
horde of Immortals. A thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals were behind each of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the other
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals, follow me. I will be our
field marshal in our campaign against the Seamless Gate!” The
black-robed Xia Emperor was filled with an awe-inspiring aura of
power as he led the five True Immortals/Empyrean Gods and the many
remaining Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals into the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity had become a true military headquarters for an Immortal
army.

Chapter 9 - Magic Treasure: Splitter
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight azure dragons
swam around the golden city within the clouds. Space undulated around
the city as a spatial tear formed, and the golden city flew straight
into the tear, disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million Immortals
were present. The skies above them were filled with endless clouds;
they were completely unable to see the outside world at all. Clearly,
they were in a separate space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each of you shall
return to your own camps. You are not to act without permission. Any
who violate orders shall be executed!” The black-robed Xia
Emperor’s voice rang out, echoing throughout the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the million
Immortals assented in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the nine
armies and the army commanded by the Xia Emperor all entered their
respective camps in an ordinary fashion, none of them daring to leave
their camps without permission. Everyone understood that in a time of
war, military discipline would be extremely tight. If the Immortals
were permitted to act and wander about as they pleased, there would
be no way an army could be quickly mobilized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite large.”
After entering the Darknorth army camp, the hundred thousand
Immortals saw a vast region with countless private rooms, more than
enough for all of them to reside in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Find your own places
and go rest for now. You are not to leave the Darknorth army camp,”
Ji Ning ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, General.” The
hundred thousand Immortals answered in an awe-inspiring chorus, their
voices shaking the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sounds from the other
army camps could be heard from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine generals, come
to the main hall for a meeting,” the Xia Emperor’s voice suddenly
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, take a rest first. I’ll be back soon,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
nodded. Although she had joined this army, there was no need for her
to enter the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning and the rest
of the nine generals arrived within the central main hall of the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity. As for the Xia Emperor and the other five
Empyrean Gods/True Immortals, they had arrived long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this campaign, I
shall serve as the field marshal. I, and I alone, shall be
responsible for our movements and our plans,” the Xia Emperor said
from his throne on high. “It isn’t that I don’t trust you;
rather, the Seamless Gate’s intelligence mechanisms are simply
unfathomably great. If I tell you, they will probably find out, and
so I am keeping it to myself for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the nine nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, your
Imperial Majesty. This is a time of war; we know what is at stake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you are our
field marshal, then it is natural that you shall be in charge of
everything, your Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortal
generals all hurriedly assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been informed
by Subhuti as to how powerful the Seamless Gate was. He understood
the Xia Emperor’s predicament. As for the others, they might or
might not understand, but they accepted the Xia Emperor’s
explanation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
black-robed Xia Emperor nodded lightly, then waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, eighteen
black globes of fur-covered flesh appeared in the air. The
black-furred globes also emanated heart-quaking golden light. These
eighteen globes all had tremendously powerful auras, causing Ning to
feel startled; he felt as though these were on the same level as the
Ananda World-Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are top-grade
Pure Yang treasures,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said. “There
are nine pairs in total. They are known as the ‘Splitters’, and
each of you shall have a pair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade Pure Yang
treasures?” Everyone present, Ning included, was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were incredibly
valuable items, even for Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. In fact,
for many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, all their treasures
combined were not worth as much as a pair of ‘Splitters’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
accepted them yet?” The black-robed Xia Emperor frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning and the
others didn’t dare to be slow; they immediately accepted the
treasures, filling them with their Immortal energy and easily binding
them. Upon doing so, Ning immediately understood how these Pure Yang
treasures were meant to be used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pair of Pure Yang
‘Splitters’ merged into Ning’s hands, causing them to instantly
transform into bestial paws. Thick black fur grew out from the palm
and the back of Ning’s hands, and his fingernails became inch-long
and knife-sharp. These were the claws of a vicious beast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.” Ning
willed it, and one of his fingernails instantly began to lengthen at
high speed, transforming into a longsword. As for the other
dagger-like fingernails, they grew shorter until they disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.” The
longsword vanished, but a sharp blade appeared at the edge of his
palm, making it seem like the edge of a greataxe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Axe, spear, sword,
staff…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these could be
manifested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Celestial
Immortals couldn’t help but feel delighted with the results of
their experiments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor glanced downwards towards them, then smiled. “Enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
immediately came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven Punishers
that your formations create possess tremendous power and are skilled
in close combat, and so in the war you shall be fighting in melee.
These treasures, the ‘Splitters’, shall serve as the weapons for
your Heaven Punishers,” the black-robed Xia emperor said. “It
doesn’t matter if you are skilled in swords, sabers, or other
weapons; the ‘Splitters’ will transform to be of use to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others now
understood. So these were meant for the Heaven Punisher Formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, let me warn
you,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said, “That although the Heaven
Punishers possess enormous strength, they are not very fast or
nimble. Your battle tactics have to be adjusted accordingly. Return
to your camps and ponder on what is the best way for you to use your
Heaven Punishers in battle, so as to allow them to unleash their
maximum power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning and the
others immediately withdrew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Darknorth
army camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the largest,
centermost private room. This was the commander’s residence, and Yu
Wei was present here, along with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I
battle?” Ning was frowning, pondering this question pensively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He thought back to the
feeling he had when he had first taken control over the Heaven
Punisher, that feeling of tremendous power. Ning nodded slightly.
“Right. The Heaven Punisher is most suited for using greataxes or
warhammers; in short, heavy weapons. They should be used to fight in
a straightforward, head-on manner, rather than in a nimble, graceful
manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a battle, one had to
make use of one’s advantages. If one was clearly weak in terms of
agility, and yet still insisted on using flashy, agile sword-arts,
one would be courting death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning’s
true body was that of a Fiendgod, and so he had many insights with
regards to close combat. He also knew multiple sword-arts, and so he
was quickly able to come up with a battle method that suited him the
most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
You’ve already come back to rest, but are still here mumbling to
yourself,” Yu Wei said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine. I’m
just thinking about my battle tactics for when I fight against the
Seamless Gate,” Ning said with a laugh. “Using the Heaven
Punisher is different from using my own Fiendgod body, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Then go ahead
and spend some time thinking about it.” Smiling, Yu Wei sat down
next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
immediately began to train.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity was now merely three hundred meters long, and it was hidden
within the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three black-armored
figures appeared out of nowhere. Moments later, the black-robed Xia
Emperor appeared as well, and he stood next to the city, gazing at
the three figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the three
figures called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Your mission
this time is a critical one; you have to set up the formation
perfectly,” the Xia Emperor said. “If you fail…then we’ll
have to pay an even larger price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
master,” the three black-armored figures said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then.” The
black-robed Xia Emperor nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The three black-armored figures flew off in three separate
directions, and then they each used spatial teleports to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor remained there, standing within the clouds, quietly attuning
himself to the locations of his three servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above a wide
river, a black-armored figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The
figure quietly pondered for a moment, then made a tossing motion.
Instantly, a tower-shaped formation-base flew into the river, sinking
into it and drilling deep into its depths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-armored figure
appeared out of nowhere in the air above a massive, towering
mountain. A tower-shaped formation-base, covered with countless
complicated runes, appeared in his hand as well. He tossed it
downwards with incredible power, and it instantly smashed deep into
the depths of the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-armored figure
appeared in the air above a desolate marsh. He, too, tossed down a
small tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In just a few moments,
more than nine small towers were set up within Whitepole Commandery,
each of which was roughly 500,000 kilometers away from Whitepole
City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Whitepole
Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor stood there quietly amidst the clouds. Upon sensing that the
nine little towers had been emplaced, he revealed a smile. “If you
start off a step ahead, you’ll remain a step ahead! Does the
Seamless Gate really think that I’ll rely on the power of the
imperial capital to the point where I shall simply defend there
without fighting back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been building up
the imperial capital for countless eras, and it was indeed the most
stable location within the Grand Xia. Right now, he had only left
behind the ‘white-robed Xia Emperor’ to watch over the capital,
but he didn’t worry at all that it might be breached. The Xia
Emperor hadn’t chosen to take the easier route of relying on his
fortified capital; instead, he had launched an attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” The Xia
Emperor instantly willed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast river,
the formerly calm flows of water suddenly turned savage and
ferocious. The tremors shaking the river grew increasingly powerful
until, with a boom, an enormous tower suddenly sprouted out from
within it, rising upwards nonstop. The tip of the tower that jutted
out from the water was more than thirty thousand meters long, and the
entire tower was covered with countless golden runes and lines.
Instantly, the world itself began to twist, and spatial ripples that
were visible to the naked eye could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering, massive
mountain began to fall apart…because from the heart of the
mountain, an even more massive black tower that was covered with
golden runes had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous divine
tower was emerging from the marsh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large region of
Whitepole Commandery, spanning more than a million kilometers, became
completely trapped within the field of divine towers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the black
citadel of the Seamless Gate located above Whitepole City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main palace of the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
was seated up high, and below him were seated the Empyrean Gods, True
Immortals, and a few Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial capital
of the Grand Xia isn’t so easily attacked. Our best chances lie in
slowly conquering the other territories of the Grand Xia, forcing the
Xia Emperor to come out and leave his headquarters,” the Cavemaster
of the Myriad Demons Cave boomed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just received
word,” Gatemaster Azurefox said, “That the Xia Emperor had
produced a Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,
and then had his entire army move into it. However…none of the
Immortals within the city know where it is. It seems that the Xia
Emperor is wary of us and doesn’t wish for us to know where he is
and what he is doing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the local
space began to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of everyone
present changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A restrictive
formation?” The black-haired, black-robed, red-eyed elder laughed
coldly. “Didn’t you say that the Xia Emperor would rely on the
strength of his imperial capital? Where did this formation come
from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qiankun has been
locked; there’s no way to Greater Teleport or void blink in this
area. Not even coresense can be used to investigate outside of it.”
Gatemaster Azurefox said softly, “The Xia Emperor is even more
confident than we expected; he actually dares to abandon his imperial
capital and attack us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Whitepole’s cold eyes held a hint of eagerness within them. He
immediately said in an icy voice, “The more he prances around, the
faster he will die. In the end…I shall be the master of the Grand
Xia. Everyone, prepare for battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hummmmm…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep sound suddenly
rang out, shaking the entire Seamless City. This was the alarm sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The attack’s
already begun?” Within the main palace, True Immortal Whitepole,
Gatemaster Azurefox, and the others all revealed looks of surprise.
This was simply too fast. The enemy formation had just been set down
moments ago, and now the attack had already arrived!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go onto the city
walls,” True Immortal Whitepole immediately ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, along with several Celestial Immortals, all quickly
departed from the main palace and flew towards the city walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless City
wasn’t that large, and so they quickly arrived at the wall from
which the warning signal had come. As they arrived, the soldiers
patrolling this wall all immediately knelt respectfully. There were
several Void-level Fiendgods amongst them, and some of them had
trained in divine abilities that allowed for distant sight;
naturally, they were able to see to a great distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” True Immortal
Whitepole and the others had divine abilities and secret arts of
their own, and they all stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was currently dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild marshes here
were surrounded by fog and mist, but the gazes of the Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals were able to pierce through them to see far off
into the distance. Roughly thirty thousand kilometers away from the
Seamless City, a towering, barefoot Fiendgod that was at least thirty
thousand meters tall had appeared. He was dressed in just a fur
loincloth, the rest of his body completely nude. He was striding
forward at astonishing speed, as though chasing after the stars or
the moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The barefoot, bounding
Fiendgod was headless. Instead, he had an incomparably savage face on
his chest, with his eyes being where his nipples should be and his
belly button having transformed into his mouth. The face was the face
of Celestial Immortal Unity. Clearly, this was the Unity Heaven
Punisher which had been formed by the Unity Army of the nine Immortal
armies of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven Punisher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals atop the walls of the Seamless City couldn’t help
but feel startled. Although Gatemaster Azurefox had already told them
that the Xia Emperor had produced the Heaven Punisher Formation,
actually seeing the headless Fiendgod with their own eyes was
different. They couldn’t help but think of True God Xingtian, the
legendary wargod whose fame shook the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, what do
you think we should do?” True Immortal Whitepole asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gatemaster Azurefox
said, “Senior apprentice-brother Whitepole, I know all of the nine
generals of the Grand Xia. Judging from the face on the chest of this
Heaven Punisher…it should be the army led by Celestial Immortal
Unity. I know how many pieces of chaos goldstone they each broke
during the trials, but that was before they were taught the critical
components of the Heaven Punisher Formation. I trust that the power
of their Heaven Punishers have increased dramatically. What we need
to find out…is how powerful, exactly, the Heaven Punishers have
become! Only then will we have a chance of defeating the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed time
for our White-Faced Flood Dragons to test themselves,” Empyrean God
Threesuns agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the Seamless Gate
was preparing their response, Ji Ning and seven other generals were
gathering together at the central, main palace of the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they arrived, they
all saluted in respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” The Xia
Emperor nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did Ning and
the others sit down. As they exchanged gazes…eh? Why isn’t
Celestial Immortal Unity here? Why have only eight of our nine
generals arrived?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve already
reached Whitepole Commandery,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said.
“In addition, I’ve already set down a grand formation that’s
locked down the space within a million kilometers of Whitepole City.
Within this region, Greater Teleportation is impossible and coresense
cannot be used. But of course…as the master of this formation, I
can scan this region. However, because there are layers of
protections surrounding the Seamless City, my coresense is unable to
penetrate into it. Everything else, however, is within my reach.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Such speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them were aware
of the Xia Emperor’s movements at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we arrived at
Whitepole Commandery, I sent out the army commanded by Celestial
Immortal Unity. They’ve already transformed into a Heaven Punisher
and are serving as our vanguard in testing the Seamless Gate’s
power.” The black-robed Xia Emperor pointed into the air, an image
instantly appearing. The image was of a vast, wild land, with a
towering, mountain-sized, nearly-unclad Fiendgod with no head who was
bounding barefoot through it. The face on the chest of the headless
Fiendgod was the face of Celestial Immortal Unity; only, it was more
fierce and savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already made
a move?” Ning was secretly startled. “It seems the Xia Emperor
truly is being cautious; he’s not letting us know about any of his
actions at all. Still, that’s for the best; it means our chances of
victory against the Seamless Gate will be improved.” Ning had great
faith in the Xia Emperor, as his background guaranteed that there was
no way he would ever join the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the scion of the
Primordial Imperial Clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial Imperial
Clan was the most powerful force on the side of the Nuwa Alliance!
One of the dominating powers of the Primordial Era, even more
powerful than both the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Sangha! Ning
naturally held great trust in the Xia Emperor’s decisiveness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a Heaven
Punisher, a Xingtian Divinity formed through a formation, after all.”
A red-bearded elder to the right of the black-robed Xia Emperor
laughed. “It isn’t a real Fiendgod, and its power is controlled
by Celestial Immortals and guided by Loose Immortals who control the
natural energy of Heaven and Earth, forming it into a fleshly body.
Thus, this fleshly body contains tremendous power, allowing it to run
at great speed. If it was soaring through the air, it would be moving
much more slowly…and so, the most suitable way for advancing is by
bounding across the land. Due to its great size and great strength,
it runs quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
red-bearded elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
knew all five of the Empyrean Gods/True Immortals by the side of the
Xia Emperor. Three of them were from the Primordial Imperial Clan and
were absolute supporters of the Xia Emperor. The other two were True
Immortal Dongyan and the founder of the Skyfarmer clan, True Immortal
Skyfarmer. Ning had long ago heard that the Kindwater clan had an
Empyrean God, but had never seen him before this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Firecloud’s words
are correct.” The Xia Emperor nodded. “You need to get a better
understanding of how to use the power of the Heaven Punishers. Watch
this battle carefully; this will be the first time our Grand Xia
truly does battle against the Seamless Gate. Remember; no matter
what, don’t be overconfident. Your Heaven Punishers each represent
a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose
Immortals. If you are defeated…you won’t be the only ones to die.
A thousand Celestial Immortals and a horde of Loose Immortals will
perish as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning the others
instantly felt a heavy feeling in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unity, you can halt
now,” the Xia Emperor suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was
transmitted straight into the ears of the Unity Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The image was currently
displaying the Unity Heaven Punisher bounding through a vast lake.
This lake was at least a thousand kilometers in size. Although the
waters of the lake were deep, they barely reached the Unity Heaven
Punisher’s calves. The giant waves were only capable of wetting the
hairs on the massive Heaven Punisher’s legs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are only ten
thousand kilometers away from the Seamless City,” the Xia Emperor
said. “Unity, wait here for now. I trust the Seamless Gate’s
attack shall arrive soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher just stood there quietly within the lake, as unmoving as
though it had been there since the Primordial Era, as though nothing
in the world could possibly shake it. Anyone who looked at it would
feel their hearts quake. The aura radiating from him was an aura of
power which only the Fiendgods of the Primordial Era possessed. This
Heaven Punisher was based off of True God Xingtian, after all; the
arrogance and the desire for battle it radiated far surpassed that of
most Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the waters of
the lake began to ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher stared towards the distant Seamless City. A little tiny
black dot was rapidly drawing closer, and as it was it was expanding
in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The creature had a
white, humanoid face, was covered with black scales, and had two arms
and two legs. It was thirty thousand meters tall, but its draconic,
serpentine body was ninety thousand meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dawn. The
surface of the vast lake was covered with mist and dew. A massive,
thirty thousand meter tall Fiendgod with no head who was dressed in
just a fur loincloth was standing within the lake. Far away, a
similarly massive white-faced beast of the Primordial Era with the
form of a Flood Dragon was charging forward. It soon reached the
lake, and its every step caused the entire lake to tremble and
ripple, arousing massive, mighty waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone within the
main palace of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity was able to clearly see
this scene clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A primordial
Terrorbeast…the White-Faced Flood Dragon?” True Immortal Dongyan
murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
should have used a technique similar to ours in creating the
White-Faced Flood Dragon.” The Xia Emperor, seated on his throne up
high, frowned. “From the looks of it…the White-Faced Flood Dragon
has no flaws at all. It looks as though it is real. Clearly, this
formation should be quite a perfect one; it definitely is something
which only a True God or a Daofather could have come up with.
However…I wonder how strong it is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watching a Xingtian
Divinity battle against a primordial Terrorbeast, a White-Faced Flood
Dragon…haha, I feel as though I’ve returned to the Primordial
Era,” True Immortal Skyfarmer said with a laugh. “Long ago in the
Primordial Era, when I was surviving by hiding behind the elders of
my clan, I once saw an ancient Fiendgod battle against a primordial
Terrorbeast. This spectacle currently before us feels identical.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Xia
Emperor laughed and nodded. “When we humans first began to flourish
and our status was still low, the Primordial Era was dominated by
those ancient Fiendgods and Godbeasts. Back then, it was their
world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godbeasts and
Terrorbeasts could be considered Fiendgods. Fiendgods which had the
form of animals were referred to as ‘Godbeasts’, while beasts
that had exceptionally violent dispositions who delighted in
slaughter and murder were referred to as ‘Terrorbeasts’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial
Terrorbeasts known as the White-Faced Flood Dragons were born with
the power of Empyrean Gods. They were awe-inspiringly famous and were
perfectly suited for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A battle between a
primordial Fiendgod and a primordial Terrorbeast?” Ning stared at
the images in midair. The massive headless Fiendgod and the massive
White-Faced Flood Dragon stared at each other from afar, their
battle-intents flooding the scene and invoking an image out of
antiquity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s begun.
Everyone, watch carefully,” the Xia Emperor suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that still,
desolate lake, the towering Heaven Punisher stood face to face with
the White-Faced Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ssss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Terrorbeast’s
body undulated with a hissing sound as it stared intently towards the
Unity Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher stared back at its opponent, watching carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two just stood
there, staring at each other for a few moments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…the
White-Faced Flood Dragon made its move!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the lake
expoded, causing the entire lake to tremble and even the distant
shores to shake. The White-Faced Flood Dragon suddenly shot forward,
instantly traversing the hundreds of kilometers between it and its
foe. Its two arms lashed out like two incomparably sharp sets of
claws, the claws of a Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why
primordial Terrorbeasts were referred to as ‘beasts’ was because
they had many bestial characteristics. Their claws and appendages,
for example, were often comparable to incredibly powerful magic
treasures. As it charged forward, the sharp claws of the Terrorbeast
ripped directly towards the Unity Heaven Punisher’s flank, seeking
to tear a massive wound within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher took just a single step back. It raised its right arm, and
the edges of its right hand seemed to transform into the edge of a
blade. It came chopping down lightning-fast, seeming to carry the
power of the true Xingtian himself as it struck.

Chapter 11 - Frenetic Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White-Faced Flood
Dragon hurriedly raised one of its hands to block. Its hands were
covered with scales and filled with sharp and long claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher chopped downwards with its hand like a giant axe, striking
directly against the left claws of the White-Faced Flood Dragon with
such power that the claws were knocked back down towards the
White-Faced Flood Dragon’s shoulders. The White-Faced Flood Dragon
couldn’t help but slightly stagger, but then it suddenly twisted
about and used its massive, ninety thousand meter long tail to lash
out lightning-fast towards the Unity Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher hurriedly raised a hand to block as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It couldn’t help but
be knocked flying backwards, rolling through the waters of the
massive lake and kicking up enormous three thousand meters waves. It
was as though a mountain had collapsed! However, the waves of the
lake didn’t impact the Unity Heaven Punisher at all; it was as
though an ordinary mortal had slipped and fallen within a muddy pool.
It lifted itself up, causing the lake to once more shudder, then
threw itself once more towards the Terrorbeast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xingtian Divinity
and the Terrorbeast exchanged multiple attacks, the battle between
them extraordinarily savage and violent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, Ji
Ning, and the others all watched the images intently, seeing the
Heaven Punisher and the White-Faced Flood Dragon battle within the
vast lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has used a primordial Terrorbeast, the White-Faced Flood Dragon, as
the basis for their formation. The profoundness of this formation and
its strength in battle is not one whit inferior to our Heaven
Punisher Formations.” The Xia Emperor frowned. “Look; although
the Terrorbeasts are slightly weaker than our Heaven Punishers in
bodily strength, their tails possess enormous power and are even
stronger than our Heaven Punishers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look; they each just
wounded the other,” the Xia Emperor said. “However, the power of
Heaven and Earth quickly heals those types of wounds. Neither has
truly wounded the other. Clearly, both sides have incredibly powerful
bodies, and it is hard for each of them to truly damage the other
with a single blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One on one, it will
be hard to achieve victory within a short period of time. The only
way to win is through strength of numbers; that’s the only way one
can kill an opponent quickly,” the Xia Emperor said. “If we can
‘kill’ one of them…if my guess is correct, those Terrorbeasts
are formed from at least a thousand Celestial Immortals and countless
Loose Immortals. Killing a Terrorbeast will be a tremendous victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to the Xia Emperor
was a female Empyrean God dressed in armor. “In battle, the key to
victory lies in strengthening yourself while whittling away at your
foes. Whittle a little away this time, a little more next time…our
advantage will continue to grow, and in the end we will annihilate
our foes with a final strike. I imagine they can’t have too many of
these primordial Terrorbeasts, these White-Faced Flood Dragons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they were chatting
amongst each other within the main palace, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle scene within
the midair image changed. The massive lake had been filled with with
blurry mists, but suddenly a wind arose, resulting in a massive
whirlpool of clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The energy of Heaven
and Earth is filling the place…?” The Xia Emperor’s face
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight generals,
hurry up and assume the Heaven Punisher Formation!” The Xia Emperor
suddenly barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the eight felt their hearts clench. They, too, had been stunned by
the sight of that enormous vortex. They could all tell that the
enemies had to be setting up additional Terrorbeast formations and
creating more White-Faced Flood Dragons. Clearly, the Seamless Gate
had tried to lull the Xia Emperor into a false sense of complacency
by initially sending just a single White-Faced Flood Dragon and using
just a little bit of natural energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however…they
were sending all of the White-Faced Flood Dragons they had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, how vicious.
So they are trying to deal me a harsh blow in our first exchange?”
The Xia Emperor laughed coldly. From the massive whirlpool above the
lake, one could tell that the White-Faced Flood Dragons that were
taking form had to be within the region of that lake. Why, then,
wasn’t anything visible yet? The only explanation was that they
were all hiding with a portable minor world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the eight immediately flew out from the main hall at full speed,
sending their coresense to their subordinates. Ning roared mentally,
“Darknorth Army, assemble the formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A throng of countless
Immortals came flying out from the eight military camps. The
Immortals moved at incredible speed, and in the blink of an eye they
gathered in midair. Ning flew towards his own Darknorth Army, and
everyone joined together into the Heaven Punisher Formations as
bloody runic lines appeared, along with an overwhelming
battle-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, eight towering,
mountain-sized barefoot Fiendgods that were clad only in fur
loincloths had appeared. The eight Heaven Punishers had all
manifested, and their auras towered through the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and reinforce
him,” the Xia Emperor barked mentally. “Protect yourselves and
annihilate your foes. The more you can kill, the better!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
assented to the order, and then all eight Heaven Punishers vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher was still battling against the White-Faced flood Dragon
Terrorbeast. Suddenly, an enormous vortex of natural energy took form
above it, and as soon as it did, another power began to draw from
that vortex, causing it to spin even more rapidly and grow even
greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
Unity Heaven Punisher could tell that something bad was happening. A
moment later, the Xia Emperor’s voice rang out by his ears.
“Careful; the Seamless Gate should have other White-Faced Flood
Dragons, and they will most likely appear imminently.” These words
from the Xia Emperor further solidified the Unity Heaven Punisher’s
suspicions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a furious roar, he
knocked the White-Faced Flood Dragon flying backwards, then pulled
away from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As suspected!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three more
mountain-sized creatures suddenly appeared out of nowhere, each of
which had long, sinuous bodies with white humanoid faces, sharp
claws, and black, scale-covered bodies that were more than ninety
thousand meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Unity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unity, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White-Faced Flood
Dragon that had been knocked away, along with the three new
Terrorbeast, simultaneously charged forward to assault the Unity
Heaven Punisher, who had immediately moved to flee when he had
knocked aside the first Terrorbeast. In but the blink of an eye, he
ran across the surface of the vast lake and out into the wilderness,
trying to buy as much time as he could. In fact, he didn’t even
turn to face the Terrorbeasts at all; in terms of running speed, the
Heaven Punishers were slightly slower, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
when the two sides were about to collide!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to the Unity
Heaven Punisher, eight towering figures suddenly appeared, all
massive Fiendgods that were dressed in fur loincloths. All eight of
them were Heaven Punishers; the only difference was in the faces on
their chests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he really
did…Xiamang’s being quite cautious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the distant city
walls of the Seamless City, True Immortal Whitepole and the others
were watching the battle that was going on ten thousand kilometers
away. Upon seeing the eight additional Heaven Punishers appear, they
couldn’t help but feel irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White-Faced Flood
Dragon they had sent out had indeed carried a magic treasure that
contained a minor world within it which had many experts hidden
inside; naturally, they would be able to unleash their power at a
moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, as soon as
they had begun to establish their White-Faced Flood Dragon Formation
and activate the natural energy of Heaven and Earth, they could
immediately sense…that the Xia Emperor’s forces seemed to be
doing the same thing. The Unity Heaven Punisher was most likely
carrying a minor world alongside it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, however…their
guesses were slightly off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…what
the Unity Heaven Punisher was carrying was the entire Eight Dragons
Cloudcity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four White-Faced Flood
Dragon Terrorbeasts facing nine Heaven Punishers. The morale of the
nine Heaven Punishers of the Grand Xia’s side swelled dramatically.
They were all filled with tremendous confidence, because they
currently held an absolute advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…we can’t
be overconfident. Our every action involves the lives of a thousand
Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose Immortals, as well
as the overall course of this war.” Although he held an absolute
advantage, thanks to the fact that his heartforce had reached the
peak of the ‘ruler’ stage, Ning was still able to remain
perfectly calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unity, Loachwater,
Dustfloat; the three of you, go slow down the three White-Faced Flood
Dragons closest to you! As for the last White-Faced Flood
Dragon…Darknorth, you and the other five join forces against it.
You have to slay that White-Faced Flood Dragon!” The Xia Emperor
gave the orders through coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Unity
Heaven Punisher, the Loachwater Heaven Punisher, and the Dustfloat
Heaven Punisher all turned to face the White-Faced Flood Dragons
closest to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh!
Ning and the other six turned to assault the final White-Faced Flood
Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Terrorbeasts
of the Seamless Gate were all rather caught offguard by this,
especially the final White-Faced Flood Dragon that was being
assaulted by the six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and join
forces to support each other!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join together to
block them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White-Faced Flood
Dragons all sent mental messages to each other and began to rapidly
move towards each other. If the four of them could completely join
forces, they would be able to defend against the nine Heaven
Punishers. They might be at a disadvantage, but they’d be able to
hold on for a brief period of time. Given the Seamless Gate’s
abilities, they’d have ample time to rescue the four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
expected this as well; their foes weren’t fools, and wouldn’t
just fight in a random, foolish manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…they
are in the wilderness right now, quite far away from the Seamless
City. We have to kill them here; if we can kill one, we need to!”
The Xia Emperor sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth Heaven
Punisher, Allbeasts Heaven Punisher, Thousand Needles Heaven
Punisher, and others all charged forward with explosive power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the four White-Faced
Flood Dragons were moving closer to each other, the Loachwater Heaven
Punisher reached its target Terrorbeast, as it was very close to it
to begin with. The mouth on the chest of the Loachwater Heaven
Punisher grinned, a savage look in its eyes. So long as it could tie
down even one of them, the chances of the other three would drop
dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.” The
Loachwater Heaven Punisher pounced forwards, and as it did it reached
an arm up high, taking a stance like Pangu splitting the cosmic egg
to establish Heaven and Earth. And then…he swung his arm down in a
furious strike!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the fleeing
White-Faced Flood Dragon suddenly turned about, swiping backwards
with a claw to block the furious blow of the Loachwater Heaven
Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With an enormous
explosion, something happened that was completely outside the
expectations of the Grand Xia’s side. In this head-on collision…it
was actually the Heaven Punisher who was knocked backwards! In fact,
it rolled over in midair as it went flying backwards; clearly, it
wasn’t even able to stabilize its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the White-Faced
Flood Dragon knocked the Loachwater Heaven Punisher backwards, it
immediately pounced forwards, lashing out with two claws at
lightning-fast speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first claw, the
Loachwater Heaven Punisher was able to just barely block through
using its left arm. However, its body grew even less stable,
resulting in an opening appearing before its chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second claw…tore
straight through the chest of the Loachwater Heaven Punisher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the earlier battle
between the Unity Heaven Punisher and the White-Faced Flood Dragon,
although both sides had been able to wound the other, the wounds were
instantly healed; those were all minor wounds. This time, however…the
claw from the White-Faced Flood Dragon actually carried such
unstoppable power that with a rip, the chest of the Loachwater Heaven
Punisher was completely torn apart! In fact, the many Loose Immortals
and Celestial Immortals hidden within the body of the Heaven Punisher
could be seen. Terror was on the face of all of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RIIIIIP!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the sharp claws of
the White-Faced Flood Dragon tore through the chest of the Heaven
Punisher, it tore through the bodies of countless Loose Immortals and
Celestial Immortals, killing them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loachwater Heaven
Punisher could no longer be maintained. It instantly crumbled,
revealing the countless, puny little Celestial Immortals and Loose
Immortals that had comprised it.

Chapter 12 - Countless Casualties
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Immortals
of the Loachwater Army…felt nothing but despair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
fairly strong, without a supreme combination formation like the
Heaven Punisher Formation, there was no way they were even remotely
qualified to exchange blows with a terrifying primordial Terrorbeast
like the White-Faced Flood Dragon! And the White-Faced Flood Dragon
before them was even more powerful than the other three Terrorbeasts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sssssss.” The
White-Faced Flood Dragon hissed with cold laughter, its enormous
claws once more sweeping forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vile creature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two furious roars rang
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two additional towering
Fiendgods suddenly appeared out of nowhere. One was the old man with
a fiery red beard, his entire body surging with flames. The other was
a rather willowy maiden; although she was an Empyrean God, at this
moment she chose to use a magic spell instead. With a rumbling sound,
a large amount of black water came pouring out, tying down her foe
and pulling away the surviving Loose Immortals and Celestial
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…members of
the Primordial Imperial Clan?” The Terrorbeast roared with
laughter. Its draconic tail lashed outwards as its claws ripped
forward, moving to massacre the Celestial Immortals and Loose
Immortals. The survivors all used whatever methods they had
available, be it hiding within their Immortal estates or using
evasive abilities. In short, they were trying to buy as much time as
they could…but alas, compared to the White-Faced Flood Dragon, they
were far too weak and slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-bearded elder,
wreathed in blazing flames that soared through the heavens, chopped
downwards towards the Terrorbeast with a massive warblade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Terrorbeast, in
turn, brandished a single claw to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two exchanged a
blow that could cause mountain ranges to shake. The red-bearded elder
was knocked flying backwards, and at even greater speed than the
Loachwater Heaven Punisher had been. The female Empyrean God who had
been next to him hurriedly moved forward to take over for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The levitating image
was still displaying the results of the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, True
Immortal Dongyan, True Immortal Skyfarmer, and the extremely muscular
Empyrean God all had ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through the eyes of the Xia Emperor. “That White-Faced Flood Dragon
is far more powerful than the other three.” He mused silently to
himself, “Can it be that it is formed with even more Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals and the others? Or is the commander of
the White-Faced Flood Dragon Formation an Empyrean God or a True
Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
possible explanations as to why the Terrorbeast was so powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
the Heaven Punishers; if it was comprised of thousands of Celestial
Immortals and many hundreds of thousands of Loose Immortals, its
power would naturally increase dramatically. If a Pure Yang True
Immortal commanded it, it would also grow more powerful…and if a
monster like Ji Ning was in command, it would similarly become very
mighty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of how powerful
the physical body of the White-Faced Flood Dragon was, and because it
was formed from an ancient formation, coresense couldn’t be used to
penetrate through it. There was no way to see inside of it at all,
and so no one could be certain as to how many Celestial Immortals and
Loose Immortals it held, or who the commander was. Although the
White-Faced Flood Dragons all had difference faces, the Xia Emperor
knew too little about the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who
battled alongside the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate,
however, knew almost everything about the Grand Xia’s side. This
disparity in information was one of the reasons that something like
this had happened. If the Xia Emperor’s side had arranged for a
Pure Yang True Immortal to take charge of a Heaven Punisher
Formation, the enemy would’ve been able to find out right away from
the chest-face of the Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to
disguise or change the faces on the chests, because they were
naturally formed by the formation itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the black
citadel hovering above Whitepole City. Countless illusory chains
continued to fill the area around the black citadel. True Immortal
Whitepole and his comrades on top of the walls of the citadel all had
smiles on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…only when
you know your enemy and know yourself shall you gain victory in all
your battles. The Xia Emperor knows far too little regarding our
Seamless Gate. Very few know about Empyrean God Venomsong; they
weren’t able to tell from the appearance of that White-Faced Flood
Dragon that it was being commanded by an Empyrean God.” The
Hallmaster of Bloodcloud Hall sent mentally, “Azurefox, your idea
of having Empyrean God Venomsong personally command a squad was a
stroke of brilliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something like this
can only be used once. Next time, they’ll know and be prepared for
Venomsong’s power,” Gatemaster Azurefox sent back. “However…once
is enough. We’ve already caused them to suffer a tremendous loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How many Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals did each side possess?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Heaven
Punishers and the White-Faced Flood Dragons…the ‘death’ of a
single one represented an utterly staggering amount of casualties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
battles amongst Immortals could last for extremely long periods of
time. This first clash, however, had already resulted in such major
losses for the enemy; it could be considered a tremendous victory.
And so, the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on the walls of the
Seamless City all had smiles on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” True Immortal
Whitepole had a smile on his face as well…but suddenly, his face
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the
Hallmaster, the Gatemaster, the Cavemaster, and the others all
changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the few
Celestial Immortals alongside the True Immortals, Immortal
Venomfreak, stared unblinkingly at the distant battle scene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the field of battle,
no one could predict exactly how things would turn out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because
sometimes, new variables would appear so suddenly that neither side
would be able to react in time. For example, just now the Loachwater
Heaven Punisher was suddenly defeated and its body was torn apart,
resulting in the entire Immortal army being defeated and in countless
casualties. This was simply too sudden, as was the Xia Emperor’s
decision to suddenly send out two Empyrean Gods to slow down the
enemy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, in terms of
raw strength, both Empyrean Gods were slightly weaker than the Heaven
Punishers and the White-Faced Flood Dragons. The Heaven Punishers and
the White-Faced Flood Dragons were formed from an enormous amount of
natural energy, after all, and so possessed enormous amounts of
strength; they could be considered as having reached the very apex of
power possible for Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, their fatal
flaw was that once their defenses were breached, they would be
finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, Empyrean
Gods could rapidly heal from even the most devastating of wounds.
This was because their physical bodies were the bodies of Fiendgods!
In addition, they were also comparatively more nimble. When two
joined forces and used magic treasures and magic spells to support
each other, they would still be able to fight evenly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the strongest
White-Faced Flood Dragon battled against the Loachwater Heaven
Punisher, Ning and the other seven Heaven Punishers were assaulting
the other three Terrorbeasts. Of the eight towering Heaven Punishers,
it was obvious that the one Ning led was the strongest one. He was
able to unleash more power from the Heaven Punisher Formations than
the others, and so his speed was naturally the fastest as well. His
Heaven Punisher ran forward with great galloping steps, and was the
first to reach the White-Faced Flood Dragon, not giving it a chance
to join forces with the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two
White-Faced Flood Dragons shouted out furiously in the human tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple towering
figures suddenly appeared out of nowhere. They were all black
aberrations that were thirty thousand meters tall, but their auras
were clearly weaker than the auras of the White-Faced Flood Dragons.
These nine Fiendgods appeared out of nowhere next to the other two
White-Faced Flood Dragons, because they had previously been hiding
within the minor world magic treasure which was being carried by the
White-Faced Flood Dragon which the Unity Heaven Punisher had been
battling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ning’s
Darknorth Heaven Punisher noticed the nine figures appear, but he
still moved with lightning speed as he bounded through the wild
landscape. With a flying pounce, he struck out with his right arm,
which had taken the form of a sharp longsword, and stabbed towards
the head of the White-Faced Flood Dragon in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The White-Faced Flood
Dragon hurriedly retreated while waving its claws to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It managed to block the
sword-attack, but it stumbled several steps backwards upon doing
soon. Ning’s Heaven Punisher, however, continued to fly forwards,
taking a second leap and once more arriving next to his opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! The
initial clash between Ning’s Heaven Punisher and the enemy caused
the enemy to feel shock, because Ning’s attack power was clearly
lower. This made no sense at all…the earlier sword-strike from Ning
had been incredibly powerful! In addition, they all knew that of the
nine Heaven Punishers, the one controlled by Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning, was the most powerful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fly.” As Ning’s
hands collided with the opponent…his right knee suddenly came
flying upwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
between the Heaven Punishers and actual Empyrean Gods. The Heaven
Punishers were stronger, but if commanders were unable to control the
full power of the Heaven Punishers, they would be unable to unleash
its full might, to say nothing of wielding every part of its body
perfectly. The arms of the Heaven Punisher were significantly weaker
than its legs. Ning had been pondering on his Heaven Punisher, and he
had slowly gained insights on the best ways to use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very risky to
incorporate the legs into his attack patterns; if he was to lose his
balance, it would be easy for the opponents to break through his
defenses and finish him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the power of
his earlier sword-strike was clearly superior to the power of his
foe; this meant he could take the risk! Risk-taking could result in
major rewards, as the power of his mighty legs was definitely enough
to break apart his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s powerful
Heaven Punisher sent its right knee flying upwards, smashing
viciously against the face of the White-Faced Flood Dragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRUNCH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One could hear the
sound of ‘bones’ shattering. The pale, humanoid face of the
White-Faced Flood Dragon instantly twisted into unrecognizable shape
as it stumbled and fell backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A longsword suddenly
appeared in each of Ning’s Heaven Punisher’s hands. The two
longswords were actually just long, sharp spikes; they had a sharp
tips, but no blades!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a
longsword in each of his two hands. After his earlier knee-strike, he
delivered a pair of blows with the swords towards the head of the
fallen White-Faced Flood Dragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the White-Faced
Flood Dragon fell, it knew that things were looking dire and so it
hurriedly brandished its claws, seeking to block…but it was only
able to block one of the longswords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
longsword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">PIERCE!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sharp tip of the
longsword carried the full, unfathomable power of the Heaven
Punisher, and it forcibly punched its way through the twisted,
mangled neck of the White-Faced Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And as it penetrated
in…it began to grind away at the innards of the White-Faced Flood
Dragon’s body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous amount of
baleful energy began to flood towards Ning. Clearly, many Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals had just died, resulting in the
creation of so much baleful energy. As Ning was the commander of the
entire formation, the baleful energy naturally ignored everyone else
and swirled straight towards Ning, being absorbed by the three
Darknorth swords that were located within the Jindan region inside
Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire White-Faced
Flood Dragon instantly collapsed, revealing the countless Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals inside of it! These Loose Immortals and
Celestial Immortals all fled in panic, trying to use any idea they
could come up with to escape, hide, or flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher, however, swung both hands towards them in a savage blow.
His hands were like massive stormclouds, covering the entire area
where the countless ant-like Immortals were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! The
cloud-like palms descended, causing countless Immortals to perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An even greater flood
of baleful energy poured into Ning’s Jindan region, and his three
Darknorth swords greedily drank in all of it.

Chapter 13 - Armies Retreat
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning didn’t
hesitate to slaughter these Immortals at all. He showed no mercy
whatsoever, because showing mercy to his foes was the same as being
cruel to those he needed to protect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous,
stormcloud-like palms continued to slam down towards the frantically
scurrying Immortals, causing them utter terror and agony. Some of
them even began to curse in rage, but they were nothing more than the
lowest of ants that would take part in this storm. In truth, in the
face of this storm, the Loose Immortals would have even more
miserable outcomes than normal mortals would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two closest
White-Faced Flood Dragons and the nine black aberrations came
charging towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
recognized the black aberrations. “Empyrean God golems?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These newcomers had
auras that were slightly weaker than the auras of the massive
formation-created Fiendgods; they were Empyrean God golems. The
reason why Ning was able to recognize them right away was because
when the forces of the Seamless Gate had attempted to assassinate him
at Brightheart Island, Old Man Yuan had killed them and given Ning
their treasures…and one of the treasures Ning acquired was an
Empyrean God golem! It was identical to these nine new Empyrean God
golems; black-colored, savage-looking, and horned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, well
done!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well-struck!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…kill them
all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven Heaven
Punishers excitedly moved to join forces with Ning. They couldn’t
be blamed for their excitement; the Seamless Gate had just slain the
Loachwater Heaven Punisher, while Ning then immediately killed a
White-Faced Flood Dragon afterwards. Just now, the other Heaven
Punishers had been enraged by the destruction of the Loachwater
Heaven Punisher. Upon seeing Ning wipe out an enemy Terrorbeast in
bloody fashion, how could they not grow excited?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, the other nine
black Fiendgods are all Empyrean God golems,” Ning sent mentally.
“They should all be weaker than the White-Faced Flood Dragons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three closest
Empyrean God golems pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, pulling
all the treasures left behind by the countless slain Immortals into
hisi storage treasure. Of course, quite a few Immortals managed to
escape. Given that Immortals fled at high speed, that they were
fleeing in every direction, and that some had even hidden themselves
within their Immortal estates, there was no way Ning could wipe them
all out. Similarly, when the Loachwater Heaven Punisher had been
destroyed, quite a few Immortals had managed to survive as well. But
of course, those who survived were the fortunate ones; in a battle at
this level, surviving after the formation collapsed was purely a
matter of luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
Heaven Punisher took a single side-step, then launched a fierce claw
attack towards an attacking Empyrean God golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s normal combat
style involved the usage of the [Starseizing Hand], and so he was
very experienced in bare-handed combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fists? Claws? Palms?
Sword-fingers? His two hands could use all these techniques!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God golem
hurriedly raised its arms to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! When contact was
made, Ning’s claw-hand attack changed into a fist-strike, and his
fist became covered with a series of sharp, protruding spikes. These
spikes were formed from the top-grade Pure Yang treasure, the
Splitters. The punch landed heavily against the twin arms of the
Empyrean God golem, and although the arms managed to block and
withstand the strike, the golem itself was still knocked flying
backwards. It flew a tremendous distance, then landed deep into the
waters of the great lake. It rolled several times before being able
to rise to its feet and once more charge forward, but by this time
Ning had already engaged in combat with the other two Empyrean God
golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s strikes all
focused on using overbearing amounts of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the three
Empyrean God golems, they were much as Ning had protected; due to
being created from precious materials, they were incredibly tough
defensively, but their attacks were clearly on a lower level.
However, because the three golems were attacking Ning in unison, Ning
didn’t have enough time to fight them and defeat them one-on-one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Empyrean God
golems aren’t that tough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Significantly weaker
than the White-Faced Flood Dragons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Heaven
Punishers began to exchange blows with the Empyrean God golems and
the White-Faced Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battle continued
unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To completely tie down
Ji Ning required the usage of three Empyrean God golems, but only two
were needed to tie down the other Heaven Punishers. The nine Empyrean
God golems and the two White-Faced Flood Dragons had joined forces,
supporting each other in defending against Ning and the rest of the
eight Heaven Punishers. Although they were at a disadvantage, the
Seamless Gate’s forces were able to hold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God golems
were incredibly resilient, after all; their bodies were comparable to
Pure Yang treasures! But of course, they had their weaknesses as
well; once they were captured or bound, they were finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God
Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon battled furiously for a time
against the two Empyrean Gods of the Grand Xia, but was unable to
kill them. Upon seeing the two White-Faced Flood Dragons and the nine
Empyrean God golems suffer assaults from the eight Heaven Punishers,
he immediately let out a furious roar and began to charge towards
them. Although the two Empyrean Gods of the Grand Xia did their best
to bar the path, they were unable to stop this mighty White-Faced
Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This White-Faced
Flood Dragon is too powerful,” Empyrean God Firecloud sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My guess is that it
has to be an Empyrean God or a True Immortal commanding it,” the
female Empyrean God sent back. “Let’s use our spells to assist Ji
Ning and the rest of the eight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Right now,
it’s best if we use spells,” Empyrean God Firecloud agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female Empyrean God
and Empyrean God Firecloud charged forwards while casting their
spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were using
binding-type spells! A roaring black river of water and a flood of
golden magma began to furiously swirl about and entangle the three
enemy White-Faced Flood Dragons and the nine enemy Empyrean God
golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Venomsong Terrorbeast was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The binding power is
nauseating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m moving even
slower now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two
White-Faced Flood Dragons felt the effects even more strongly. Before
this, they had an advantage over the Heaven Punishers in terms of
speed, but now they were at a disadvantage. Even their attack power
had dropped significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nine
Empyrean God golems, they were impacted even more heavily. They were
weaker to begin with, and now that they were being slowed down by the
spells, their power dropped dramatically. Fortunately, the two
Empyrean Gods of the Grand Xia had cast wide area-of-effect spells
that weren’t focused on them, which was why they were able to
continue battling against the Heaven Punishers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Venomsong
Terrorbeast was impacted the least, and he charged forward in berserk
fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
seven Heaven Punishers instantly felt great danger impending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whacko, Allbeasts,
Dustfloat, let’s go deal with it,” Celestial Immortal Unity sent.
The four of them were facing the Venomsong Terrorbeast, and were the
closest ones to him; thus, it was up to the four of them to receive
his attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Celestial
Immortal Unity was sent flying backwards from the initial collision,
but the other three Heaven Punishers immediately moved to block the
Venomsong Terrorbeast, giving him no chance to press the assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a time, four Heaven
Punishers launched wild joint attacks against the Venomsong
Terrorbeast. They rained down their blows in sequence, supporting
each other and managing to withstand the terrifying White-Faced Flood
Dragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and the
remaining Heaven Punishers, they continued to wildly battle the nine
Empyrean God golems and the other two White-Faced Flood Dragons. Ning
alone was suffering assaults from six separate Empyrean God golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the distant walls
of the black citadel, the Seamless City. True Immortal Whitepole,
Gatemaster Azurefox, and the others were watching from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told them long ago
to be wary of the one named Ji Ning.” Gatemaster Azurefox had a
frown on her face, as well as a hint of anger on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t blame
them.” The Hallmaster of the Bloodcloud Hall shook his head.
“Things change too quickly on the field of battle. Once you give
your enemy an opening, you won’t even have a chance to flee. In
addition…that Ji Ning took on a tremendous risk. He actually dared
to use jump up and use a knee-strike? True Fiendgods rarely use
techniques like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
said coldly, “To do what others dare not do; that’s what made him
formidable. For true Fiendgods, their full power is merged together
with each strike, and so it is enough to use the arms to attack. The
formation commanders of the Heaven Punishers and the White-Faced
Flood Dragons are only able to control part of their strength, to say
nothing of merging it all together in each blow. The legs of the
Heaven Punishers are far more powerful than their arms. If Ji Ning
hadn’t used such a risky attack, our side would’ve been able to
hold on and the nine Empyrean God golems would’ve been able to make
it there in time. But Ji Ning’s risky maneuver…he broke through
the defenses of the White-Faced Flood Dragon with a knee, then
slaughtered it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others present all
needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning truly
has become a dangerous variable,” Gatemaster Azurefox said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned Immortal
Venomfreak had an even uglier look on his face now, but a mocking
look was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, when he was
with the Nuwa Alliance, he had been worried that Ning would take
revenge on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had joined
the Seamless Gate…it became the Seamless Gate who wanted to kill
Ning, even more than Venomfreak did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle can be
concluded now,” True Immortal Whitepole said. “The Xia Emperor
has other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who have yet to appear,
while we haven’t used our full power either. Even if both of us did
use our full power, neither of us would be able to sweep away our
opponents. This initial clash has been enough; it’s shown us our
opponent’s strengths and weaknesses. It’s time for us to ponder
on them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We definitely do
need to ponder on this. It seems…we’ll need to request additional
reinforcements from the Fifth World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them had
expected to fully destroy their enemies in this first clash; that
would be a gross underestimation of the Xia Emperor. If they were so
foolish as to continue to flail about…even if they managed to win,
the price they would pay would be catastrophic. What the Seamless
Gate wanted to do was to conquer the entire Grand Xia while suffering
the least amount of casualties possible. But of course…if there
were no other options, they would be willing to pay whatever price
was necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venomsong.” True
Immortal Whitepole looked towards the other Empyrean God of the
Seamless Gate. “Halt the battle. Come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person he was
speaking to was, of course, Empyrean God Venomsong, albeit just a
clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Fiendgod, he was
able to effortlessly create thousands of clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Empyrean
God Venomsong narrowed his eyes and nodded. “However…before we
retreat, I want to personally test this Ji Ning’s power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank, you
Venomsong.” The black-robed, black-haired, red-eyed elder suddenly
said something for the first time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, fellow Daoist
Crimsonjoy, no need to thank me. I know that you were entrusted with
fellow Daoist Blackheaven with the task of killing Ji Ning. I might
be helping you out, but I am primarily acting to serve the Seamless
Gate’s interests. This Ji Ning truly is an impediment to our
conquest of the Grand Xia.” Empyrean God Venomsong nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-eyed elder
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t under the
command of Gatemaster Azurefox at all. He had come on the request of
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, and he had just one mission…to kill
Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
most likely going to retreat soon. Beware their final attack,” Ji
Ning sent mentally. He was the strongest member on their side, and so
was able to read the flow of battle better than any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Everyone, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. The most
powerful White-Faced Flood Dragon just ran off. Ah! Ji Ning, be
careful!” Celestial Immortal Unity sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning noticed this as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
White-Faced Flood Dragon moved incredibly fast. Upon disengaging, it
shot out in a solitary line and charged towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the other
Heaven Punishers moved closer to Ning, intending to support him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Venomsong
Terrorbeast charged forward ferociously. Venomsong wanted to test
Ning…but of course, if he was able to kill Ning, that would be even
better. His claws tore outwards, seeming to carry the power to rend
apart the sky itself as he struck straight towards Ning’s Heaven
Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took one step back
with his left leg, both knees bending slightly as he used both of his
palms to meet the ferocious claw-strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
powerful exchange of blows in this initial clash. The shockwaves from
the collision caused the ground itself to split apart, with enormous
craters appearing in the ground beneath both Ning’s Heaven Punisher
and the White-Faced Flood Dragon. Both their bodies sank downwards,
their legs plunging knee-deep into the earth. The earth around them
rippled outwards like massive waves, and the ripples spread all the
way to the distant lake, kicking up absolutely shocking waves.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_14___No_Way_Out"></A>
Chapter 14 - No Way Out
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning could sense a
terrifying power spread out to encompass his entire body. He had bent
his knees and assumed a stable stance to build up power to block the
blow, but upon actually receiving this terrifying strike from
Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon…Ning couldn’t help but
stagger back heavily by one step. He almost went down to one knee as
his body was pressed downwards before he was able to weather the
powerful collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! A cold smirk was
on Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon as his second claw attack
ripped out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had two sharp claws,
after all! Just now, he had only used a single one to tear at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained very
clear-headed. His right hand manifested another longsword, and his
sword-light struck out like water, lashing sideways against the sharp
claws of the Venomsong Terrorbeast and knocking it aside. Ning
immediately retreated, pulling back. “Hmph. This White-Faced Flood
Dragon’s first claw came with all of its power and was tremendously
strong. The sudden attack from the second claw, however, was a bit
weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Venomsong didn’t
really expect to actually be able to slay Ji Ning with just two
claws. He immediately moved to pursue Ning, sending the two claws in
another ferocious strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was forced back
time and time again, but he was still able to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Heaven
Punishers came to assist Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Venomsong
could tell that he had lost his chance. All he could do was furiously
strike out with his draconic tail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lifted both his
arms, blocking the strike from the ninety thousand meter tail, then
relied on the counter-force from the blow to retreat backwards. His
movements, however, remained perfectly steady.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Venomsong
gave Ning a hateful look, then glanced sideways at the other seven
Heaven Punishers. He smirked, then barked a mental order, “Retreat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” Everyone
assented to his order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two
White-Faced Flood Dragons and the nine Empyrean God golems
immediately began to retreat, under the command of Empyrean God
Venomsong. They all began to move at full speed, bounding across the
wild marshes, traversing tens of kilometers with each movement as
they moved rapidly towards the levitating black citadel. Even though
Ning and the others remained more than ten thousand kilometers away
from the Seamless City, they could still sense how utterly enormous
the citadel was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to chase.”
The Xia Emperor’s voice rang out by the ears of Ning and the
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Heaven
Punishers and the two Empyrean Gods came to a halt, just staring off
into the distance at their fleeing foes. They then turned to look at
each other, a complicated look in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was just a very
short exchange, but countless Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals
died.” Ning and the others couldn’t help but feel a sort of
sympathetic grief. Today, it was the Loachwater Heaven Punisher which
had fallen. In the future…it could be them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Ning and the others disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals were gathered here, within the main
plaza of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity. They stared at the Xia Emperor
and the others around him, such as Ning and the rest of the nine
generals. Celestial Immortal Loachwater was with them as well.
Although the Loachwater Army had suffered castastrophic casualties,
there were still many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals who had
survived. Celestial Immortal Loachwater had been lucky and had
managed to survive as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow
Immortals,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said solemnly, “This was
the first battle between our Grand Xia and the Seamless Gate. Even I
didn’t expect that in our first real battle, we would have suffered
such heavy losses. The Loachwater Army suffered heavy casualties,
with 436 slain Celestial Immortals and 51,210 slain Loose Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own heart sank
as well upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">436 Celestial Immortals
and 51,210 Loose Immortals. What did this represent? Everyone present
knew the answer. Prior to the onset of this great storm, the
Black-White College had only produced a single Celestial Immortal in
its entire history. Even the Youngflame clan, a clan that was ranked
as one of the top ten clans of the Grand Xia, had only produced nine
Celestial Immortals and around a thousand Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words…the
casualties they had suffered today represented a force that was tens
of times more powerful than the entire Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slain Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals had come from throughout the various
commanderies of the Grand Xia; they had come in response to the Xia
Emperor’s summons, gathering at the imperial capital. They had come
from countless schools, clans, and sects; that was why so many of
them had been able to gather in one place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This happened as a
result of poor command decisions by myself.” The black-robed Xia
Emperor’s voice was low. “The Seamless Gate has a formidable
intelligence network, while we know very little about them. We didn’t
know in advance that one of the White-Faced Flood Dragons was that
powerful. Still…we know all along that our war against the Seamless
Gate would result in heavy losses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals below him were all silent. Their hearts
were heavy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their losses were
even heavier than ours!” The black-robed Xia Emperor’s gaze
turned slightly more vicious than before. “Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning, led his Heaven Punisher to defeat and slay a
White-Faced Flood Dragon. He killed more than six hundred Celestial
Immortals and nearly seventy thousand Loose Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morale of the
Immortals located below him began to lift noticeably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They killed our
warriors, but we killed theirs as well. In fact…we killed even more
of them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is war!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A war of life and
death. The Grand Xia, the Seamless Gate…one side has to fall!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we don’t want
to die, then we have to kill them. Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
voice rang out, echoing throughout the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
The Xia Emperor roared once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
voice, along with the enormous pressure all of the Immortals felt,
caused all of the Immortals to let out angry snarls as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Immortals
present knew that there was no way for anyone to hide from this
storm. They had to face it head on. If they wanted to survive…they
had to go all out! They had to make their enemies die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you can go
back to your camps to rest. This will be a long war. Today was just
the beginning,” the Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Imperial
Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all of the
Immortals acknowledged his command, then flew back in a dense mass
towards their respective camps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back to
the main palace.” The Xia Emperor swept his nine generals with his
gaze, then immediately turned to head towards the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
seated up high on his throne. His five Empyrean Gods/True Immortals
were by his side, while Ning and the rest of the nine remained
standing before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
Celestial Immortal Loachwater’s face was completely ashen. He
stepped forward, then immediately went down to his knees. “It was
because of me. I was hungry for a victory, causing so many of our
fellow Immortals to die. Imperial Majesty, please punish me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor gave
him a glance. “You were the general for the Loachwater Army, but
today you caused so many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals to
die in battle. Indeed, you cannot escape responsibility for this
disaster. However…strictly speaking, I can’t fully blame you.
That White-Faced Flood Dragon was indeed more powerful than we had
expected. This time, I’ll let the matter rest…but in the future,
you must be more cautious. I will arrange for new Celestial Immortals
and Loose Immortals to enter and replenish your Loachwater Army. Do
not disappoint me a second time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he now knew
that he would not be punished, Celestial Immortals Loachwater still
felt great guilt in his heart. Upon hearing the Xia Emperor promise
him new Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals to rebuild his
Loachwater Army, he couldn’t help but feel shocked. “Imperial
Majesty, this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have faith in
you,” the Xia Emperor said calmly. “Enough. You can rise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loachwater will not
disappoint you again, your Imperial Majesty.” Celestial Immortal
Loachwater rose to his feet, a fierce look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor turned
his gaze towards the others. “What do you think of this battle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That White-Faced
Flood Dragon had to have been commanded by an Empyrean God or a True
Immortal,” the nearby red-bearded elder said. “When I fought
against him, I saw that although his claw attacks were seemingly
simple, they contained full mastery over the Grand Dao of Blackwater.
The commander is definitely an Empyrean God or True Immortal. As for
how many additional Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals he had
under his command…that’s hard to say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The Xia
Emperor nodded. “Ji Ning and the rest of the nine, listen up; in
the future, you absolutely must not fight against that White-Faced
Flood Dragon by yourself. Even you, Ji Ning, must only attack if you
have helpers nearby.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand,”
Ning said. “When I fought against him, I saw that he was superior
to me in every aspect, be it strength or speed. I might be able to
hold on for a short period of time, but any longer…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, you might be able to hold on for a short period of time,
but the rest of us would probably be defeated in just one or two
exchanges,” Celestial Immortal Dustfloat said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, when fighting
that White-Faced Flood Dragon, you have to have at least two
helpers,” the Xia Emperor said. “Also; what are your opinions
regarding those Empyrean God golems?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tough to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very tough to deal
with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They get in the
way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
fought against the golems personally. They all had frowns on their
faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already become
the unspoken leader of the nine generals. He said, “The attacks of
the Empyrean God golems weren’t that strong, but they are
manufactured golems with bodies as tough as Pure Yang treasures; it
is hard to damage them through direct attacks. The only way to deal
with them is to suppress them through overwhelmingly superior power,
then capture them. However…if several of them join together,
there’s no chance for us to capture them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. No matter how
we attack them, we can’t damage them,” Celestial Immortal Unity
and the others agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning realized that
these Empyrean God golems were much similar to himself, back when he
had first learned the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; weak attacks but
incredibly powerful defenses. Most likely, there was only two ways to
deal with them; constricting and binding them, or suppressing and
sealing them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, your Imperial
Majesty,” Ning suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The Xia
Emperor looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have an Empyrean
God golem,” Ning said, “One of the same type that we just fought
against.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You do?” The Xia
Emperor was surprised and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I acquired it when
the Seamless Gate attacked me,” Ning said. “But I only have one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good! In
their campaigns against the other major worlds, the Seamless Gate
lost several Empyrean God golems to our side. I did everything I
could, but only managed to procure three of them. Now that you have
another one…excellent!” The Xia Emperor said hurriedly. “These
Empyrean God golems are incredibly precious. I won’t force you to
give it up for free. Ji Ning, if there is anything you want, I will
trade it to you, but you have to give me the golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Since I
mentioned it, I naturally have the intentions of giving it to you,
your Imperial Majesty. As for what I need…Imperial Majesty, you can
just give me some Pure Yang Immortal pills or Great Firmament
Immortal pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve prepared a
very large number of these pills.” The Xia Emperor let out a sigh.
“I don’t know how long this war will go on for. All of our
Immortals will need Immortal pills to replenish their energy at
critical moments, and so we need many pills. Haha…I’ll give you
an entire bottle of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately waved
his hand, producing a black, palm-sized horned golem within his hand,
one which looked identical to the Empyrean God golems they had
previously battled against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because this was a
manufactured treasure, its size could be changed as necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God golem
flew towards the Xia Emperor, and a bottle of pills flew towards
Ning. Ning knew very well that this golem required many Celestial
Immortals working together to control it. It was useless to him, but
it was incredibly useful on the field of battle. As for the pills…he
desperately needed powerful pills to train in the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]. At present, he had only reached the fifth stage of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The Xia
Emperor said, “The battle between us and the Seamless Gate is one
in which only one size can survive. There’s nowhere for us to
retreat to. In addition, we will be fighting against them for a long
period of time; after all, if we can tie down more of their forces
here, it will mean that they can’t use those forces to attack other
major worlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia was just
one battlefield in this war. If all the major worlds hid their forces
without willing to use them, then the Seamless Gate would be able to
focus on them one-by-one and defeat them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…every single
major world had to go all out, to fight as if they were mad! If the
Seamless Gate wanted to take them over, they would have to pay enough
of a blood price!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starting from
tomorrow, each time the nine Heaven Punishers go out into battle, Ji
Ning will be the leader. None of the Heaven Punishers are to stray
too far away from him. I will ensure that the Eight Dragons Cloudcity
is close to Ji Ning, so that I can reinforce him immediately,” the
Xia Emperor said. “The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals will also
reinforce you as needed. At appropriate moments, I’ll also send out
the four Empyrean God golems to assist you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This war will most
likely last for a very long period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you have
battled against the Seamless Gate, both you and them are more
experienced. It is unlikely that either side will be able to gain
easy victories in the future. However…you must not grow too
complacent. Over the course of many battles, you will have many
chances to slain one of the White-Faced Flood Dragons, and each will
represent an enormous victory,” the Xia Emperor said. “Succeed
several times, and the foe will no longer have any White-Faced Flood
Dragons left. The more of them perish, the greater our chances of
success shall be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life will be tough.
We’ll be engaged in a long war, and if you slip up, the result will
be death,” the Xia Emperor said. “Thus…my nine fellow
Immortals, you must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, your Imperial
Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Celestial
Immortal Unity, Celestial Immortal Loachwater, Fairy Rainsoar,
Celestial Immortal Dustfloat, Celestial Immortal Allbeast, Fairy
Thousand Needles, Celestial Immortal Whacko, and Celestial Immortal
Rainbow all assented solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war would be a
cruel, vicious one. Perhaps others amongst them would fall, and each
time they fell, it would mean that a thousand Celestial Immortals and
a hundred thousand Celestial Immortals had fallen with them. And
yet…none of them felt any fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of the war
before them, there was no way out for anyone!

Chapter 15 - Protection
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
eight commanders all returned to their own military camps, which were
quite spacious. Entering the camp, Ning walked towards his own
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals saw Ning, they all called out to him.
Ning smiled back to them, even calling out some of their names.
“Fellow Daoist Frostlike. Fellow Daoist Dong Zixiu…” He could
sense the veneration these Immortal soldiers felt towards him. Back
when they were in the imperial palace of the Grand Xia, these
Immortals only followed Ning because the Xia Emperor had ordered it.
Now, however, Ning’s performance in battle had thoroughly convinced
them. If they were to follow a powerful leader, they would have a
much greater chance of surviving this terrible storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The veneration these
people showed Ning caused him to feel full of vigor and energy, but
it also made him feel pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He soon reached his
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, dressed in
white clothes, was waiting for him at the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are back.” Yu
Wei smiled. “I heard the other Immortals talking about you just
now. Our Darknorth Army has achieved a great victory; supposedly, we
killed hundreds of Celestial Immortals and tens of thousands of Loose
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. However, our
losses in the Loachwater Army were very heavy.” Ning strode into
the residence, then stared in surprise. “Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This residence was the
general’s residence, and so it was fairly large. Prior to this,
however, it had been sparsely decorated and plain-looking. Now,
however, there were paintings hanging on the walls, and there were
exquisite pieces of furniture laid out throughout the rooms. In fact,
there was now even a special study, with a table that was covered in
quills, ink, and paper. There was a brush-holder that had three
feather brushes within it. When relaxing, Ning usually liked to write
calligraphy and paint paintings. At the innermost part of the
residence, there was also a private resting room meant for the two to
sleep together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some exquisitely made
delicacies were currently placed atop the black wooden table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, how’d you do this so quickly?” Ning laughed.
“I just went out for a short while, but by the time I returned, our
entire home has changed. You’ve even prepared a meal for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This campaign is
most likely going to be a very long one. We are most likely going to
be living here for a very long period of time; naturally, I have to
decorate it a bit and make it look nice. Just now, when I saw the Xia
Emperor summoning the nine of you to the main palace, I took the
opportunity to cook a few dishes as well,” Yu Wei said with a
smile. “You’ve come back with a resounding victory; we have to
celebrate it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we do.” Ning
immediately sat down, picking up his chopsticks and picking up a
crystalline piece of meat that looked like pineapple in texture, then
eating it. This was indeed personally prepared by Yu Wei; he could
tell as soon as he tasted it. When the two had lived together in the
Black-White College, Yu Wei had often personally prepared food for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent. It’s
delicious,” Ning praised. “You should sit and have some as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei sat down next to
him, accompanying him in eating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei ate
together and chatted together. Suddenly, Ning felt as though his
heart, which had previously still felt excited and restless after
that great battle, had turned calm. Back when he had lived by the
side of his parents, he felt this sort of inner peace. Now, when he
was with Yu Wei, he felt the same thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at Yu Wei,
who was eating slowly while gently stroking her stomach. He murmured
silently to himself, “Even though the storm has come…I, Ji Ning,
swear that I will do everything I can to protect you and our unborn
child.” The things he needed to protect were also the things he
cared the most about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
The Stellar Hall. Before the thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
manifested a seemingly material Immortal sword within his hands,
using it to train in sword-play. Sword-light flashed everywhere, and
sword-ki flew everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to master the
entire Dao of the Sword as soon as possible, as well as come up the
heartforce technique.” Ning came to a halt, a hint of delight in
his eyes. “Although my battle against the Seamless Gate was quite
short, a life-and-death battle like that was of tremendous help to me
in gaining further insights into the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That battle was a
battle in which both sides harbored the intention of killing the
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no mercy to
be shown whatsoever!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a battle where
one completely emptied one’s mind of everything besides the fight.
This did indeed allowing for an astonishing improvement in one’s
insights into the sword. For example, even back on Earth, if you had
one swordsman who had studied for several years in a martial arts
school and another swordsman who had fought in just a few
life-and-death battles with the goal of surviving, the latter would
probably be able to kill the former in just a single exchange of
blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life-and-death
battles…these things could indeed provide tremendous strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I’ll
be engaged in many battles. I have to work hard to understand more of
the Dao of the Sword and master it as soon as I can.” Ning was
already very close to the final bottleneck of the Dao of the Sword;
after reaching it, he would only need one more step before mastering
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve just barely
managed to reach the basic level of skill in the application of
heartforce to the soul, but to create…” Ning frowned when he
thought about heartforce, because it was clearly far harder to
advance in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was easy to reach
the basic level of skill, because there was a very close relationship
between heartforce and the soul to begin with. Even if you didn’t
know any special heartforce techniques at all, just possessing
powerful heartforce would be of tremendous help in controlling magic
treasures. Thus, Ning had quickly reached the most basic level of
skill, but to further analyze it and come up with many practical
methods for perfecting it and applying it to the soul was of
incredible difficulty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin
training in my [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sat
down in the lotus position. He sat down within the thatched cottage,
pulling out a pill bottle. Pulling out the plug, he glanced inside,
then nodded. “The Xia Emperor is indeed generous. Just a portion of
this is enough for me to train to the Sixth Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately pulled
out a sparkling golden pill, a Great Firmament Immortal pill, then
tossed it into his mouth. The Great Firmament Immortal pill contained
an astonishing amount of energy, but his Fifth Cycle foundation of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was completely capable of absorbing it
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main plaza of the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine massive Heaven
Punishers stood there, and next to them were four equally towering
Empyrean God golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the nine of
you should have a good spar against them. Get them familiar with
battles against these types of opponents.” The black-robed Xia
Emperor stood to one side, watching as he gave instructions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The nine
Heaven Punishers looked at the four golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the golems
were from the Xia Emperor, while the fourth was originally Ning’s.
It must be understood that the Xia Emperor had two thousand Celestial
Immortals under his direct command. While he had sent some to
replenish the ranks of the Loachwater Army, he had also arranged for
others to go utilize the Empyrean God golems. Empyrean God golems
needed to be controlled by Celestial Immortals; Loose Immortals were
useless for this purpose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, go ahead and use your full power!” The four Empyrean God
golems were proceeding with caution as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the nine exchanged a glance, going so far as to grin at each other.
Then, with a series of whooshing sounds, they immediately threw
themselves towards their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine Heaven Punishers
against four golems?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, a
single Heaven Punisher would be able to easily suppress two of these
golems. Ning was able to give all four of them a good fight by
himself. When all nine of them joined together…they would naturally
be able to dominate these Empyrean God golems with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They battled so
violently, the world itself seemed to turn dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity was a Protocosmic spirit-treasure, far more stable
than the outside world. They couldn’t even damage the ground in the
slightest. Ning and the others unleashed their full power, using
saber-arts, sword-arts, staff-arts, axe-arts, and more, sending the
four golems flying again and again. The four Empyrean God golems were
incredibly resilient and able to swiftly clamber back to their feet
and once more enter the fray. This was, of course, a ‘battle’ to
accumulate experience; if they were fighting against the Seamless
Gate, they would really be going all out to capture, subdue, and
kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can halt,” the
Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Heaven
Punishers and the four Empyrean God golems immediately came to a
halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it feel?”
The Xia Emperor asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of them are
roughly as powerful as the Empyrean God golems on the Seamless Gate’s
side,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not much
difference,” Celestial Immortal Unity and the others agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor nodded.
“As I suspected. We’ve tested these Empyrean God golems multiple
times, and as a result we’ve discovered that having a hundred and
fifty Celestial Immortals controlling them is an optimal number. If
you use any more, it won’t increase the power of the golems by
much, but if you use any fewer, the amount of power will drop
dramatically. A hundred and fifty; that’s the perfect number for
using these golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a hundred and
fifty?” Ning called out in surprised, “If that’s the case, then
they are able to tie me down by using just four golems and six
hundred Celestial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew exactly what
a pain these Empyrean God golems were to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor shook
his head. “The reason why they are so tough is due to the golems
themselves. They are incredibly rare; right now, I only have four of
them, including the one you gave me. Even the Seamless Gate has a
limited number of them. Otherwise, they would just employ a large
number of them, at which point we would definitely be defeated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God golems
are very difficult to create, and they are extremely costly. Our side
is completely unable to manufacture them.” The Xia Emperor sighed.
“The core formation-diagrams of the Empyrean God golems…our
Daofathers and True Gods have tried on multiple occasions to steal
some, but they failed every time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
that incredible in their golem-forging skills?” Celestial Immortal
Unity and the others hadn’t known this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. In the
Dao of Constructs, they far outstrip us; there’s no need to deny
this at all,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Years ago, his junior
apprentice-brother Mu Northson had been imprisoned within one of the
enemy bases. That place, a mere base, had amply demonstrated that
their skills in manufacturing constructs had reached an unfathomable
level. Even Northson had been stunned by their prowess! Despite that,
the base had most likely been one of the low-level manufacturing
facilities for the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The core
formation-diagrams for the golems are the most valuable parts,” the
Xia Emperor said. “If we can acquire them, then we can manufacture
golems of our own. In fact, the Seamless Gate has other golems as
well, including some that are even more powerful than Empyrean God
golems. Acquiring a set of the core formation-diagrams would be of
great benefit to our overall position throughout the entire Three
Realms. Gaining a formation-diagram would be even more important than
losing the entire Grand Xia major world. But alas…we haven’t been
able to acquire one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the leaders of
the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Way, the Primordial Imperial Clan,
and Subhuti of the ‘Dream of the Three Realms’ had been able to
procure these diagrams. From this, one could tell how tightly and
carefully the Seamless Gate protected them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we could acquire
a set…” The Xia Emperor’s eyes were filled with obvious desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could acquire
one, then most likely all of the Daofathers and True Gods of the Nuwa
Alliance would thank him. It must be understood that the strongest
golems of the Seamless Gate had the power to threaten even True Gods
and Daofathers. This was one of the gravest concerns for the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance, and one of the most frightening aspects
of the Seamless Gate. In fact, to ensure that golems would be
manufactured properly, the leaders had even set up an independent
organization, the ‘Myriad Demons Cavern’, to carry out that task.
The Nuwa Alliance had attempted to infiltrate the Myriad Demons
Cavern to acquire formation-diagrams, but they had failed each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough of that.”
The Xia Emperor refocused his attention, turning to look towards Ning
and the others. “Take a rest. The forces of the Seamless Gate are
already taunting us and calling for battle. Prepare to engage them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, the Xia
Emperor waved his hand, producing an illusory image next to him. The
illusory image showed four White-Faced Flood Dragons and nine
Empyrean God golems; clearly, the destroyed White-Faced Flood Dragon
had its ranks replenished. Like the Xia Emperor, the Seamless Gate
had quite a few Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals in reserve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
illusory image.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing one would be a
major accomplishment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning looked at the
image before him, the picture in his mind was that of Yu Wei
caressing her belly. He had to protect them, no matter what.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After resting for a few
moments…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Nine Heaven Punishers vanished from the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,
going to the outside world.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the
Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the black-haired, black-robed,
red-eyed elder. They stared at the distant battle occurring, with
nine Heaven Punishers doing battle against four White-Faced Flood
Dragons and nine Empyrean God golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Crimsonjoy,” True Immortal Whitepole said with a calm laugh,
“Fellow Daoist Blackheaven asked you to kill Ji Ning. I wonder…when
do you plan to make your move?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a head-on battle,
True Immortal Whitepole was very confident in his powers. Most likely
not even Azurefox was a match for him. In terms of killing someone,
however…True Immortal Whitepole didn’t dare to compete against
True Immortal Crimsonjoy. Engaging in a head-on fight was completely
different from murdering someone. True Immortal Crimsonjoy was
extremely skilled in murder; he had many murderous techniques indeed!
In the Seamless Gate’s headquarters, True Immortal Crimsonjoy had a
very special, transcendent position. Not one of the hundred Seamless
Gates under the command of the Godking were qualified to command True
Immortal Crimsonjoy. Crimsonjoy reported directly to the Godking
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even True Immortal
Whitepole was able to ask him for help. And so, he truly didn’t
understand…how was it that Blackheaven, who was clearly a mere
Celestial Immortal, had managed to accomplish this? True Immortal
Whitepole always had the feeling that Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
had many secrest about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. The time
isn’t right yet,” True Immortal Crimsonjoy said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, fellow Daoist
Crimsonjoy…fellow Daoist Blackheaven must have paid a significant
price to get you to help out, right?” True Immortal Whitepole said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy glanced at True Immortal Whitepole, then grinned. “You
couldn’t possibly guess what the price was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me have a
guess?” True Immortal Whitepole laughed, intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t tell you.”
True Immortal Crimsonjoy shook his head. “Still..don’t worry.
Since I accepted fellow Daoist Blackheaven’s request, I’ll do
everything I can and pay any price to kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
nodded lightly. It wasn’t too likely that he would be able to take
such a powerful figure under his command, and so he simply said, “You
said that this isn’t the right time yet. When is the right time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait patiently.”
True Immortal Crimsonjoy stared at the nine distant Heaven Punishers
and the most powerful of them all, Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait?” True
Immortal Whitepole frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy gave True Immortal Whitepole another glance, then said,
“The more overconfident they are, the greater my chances of killing
them are. Right now, however, the war has just begun. All of them,
the Xia Emperor concluded, are on high alert and are extremely
cautious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…they’ll
always be cautious,” True Immortal Whitepole argued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s different.”
True Immortal Crimsonjoy shook his head. “Right now, they are
cautious of everything. After multiple battles happen and as time
goes on, they’ll slowly grow accustomed to the rhythm of battle,
and as that happens…although they’ll still be careful, they’ll
naturally become less guarded against those things they feel
accustomed to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
nodded in seeming understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply put…after
they fight for a long time, even though they’ll still be in great
danger each day, they’ll grow numb to the danger,” True Immortal
Crimsonjoy said. “What I need to do is wait for them to grow numb.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then when the time
comes, I’ll be watching to see your abilities, fellow Daoist
Crimsonjoy. Our Seamless Gate has sought to kill Ji Ning, but we’ve
never been able to succeed, even though we’ve spent quite a bit of
effort on it,” True Immortal Whitepole said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy shook his head. “The Seamless Gate has many powerful
figures; Commander Azurefox alone has many mighty experts under her.
If the Godking truly wanted to kill Ji Ning and was willing to pay
any price, including risking a battle against the Daofather behind Ji
Ning, Ji Ning would’ve died long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy’s gaze fell once more upon Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher.
He let out a soft sigh. “He truly is a peerless genius. A pity…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy was a very patient man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waited for over
three years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years later. A
misty dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an incredibly

Punishers and five Empyrean God golems were in a frenetic battle
against three White-Faced Flood Dragons and eight Empyrean God
golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The land shook, and the
mountains trembled. In fact, many of the distant mountain ranges had
already collapsed into piles of rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher was wielding a pair of divine swords that would occasionally
appear and occasionally vanish. Sword-light flashed everywhere, with
the attacks occasionally transforming into heavy punches and
insidious claw strikes. He was currently fighting against the
Venomsong Terrorbeast, and the nearby Celestial Immortal Unity was
occasionally giving him a hand. The two of them, fighting together,
were now completely capable of slowing down Venomsong’s White-Faced
Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.”
Venomsong gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh! Instantly,
the massive forms began to gather together and retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and his comrades
just watched as they departed. “Let’s leave.” Ning gave the
order as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Heaven
Punishers and the five Empyrean God golems vanished, returning back
to the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Loose
Immortals and Celestial Immortals were allowed to disperse and return
back to their own camps. As for the seven generals, they turned to
fly towards the walls of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven of them
arrived, then sat down atop the city walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s try
some of my wine today. I acquired this Immortal wine when I took part
in the Feast of Peaches 1 back in the Primordial Era. Only a little
bit is left now, but…since we have wine today, let’s get drunk
today. Come, come, come!” Celestial Immortal Whacko laughed loudly,
but a hint of grief remained visible within his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whacko’s wine?
That’s good stuff.” Ning immediately accepted and filled his
gourd with the wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others smiled and
filled their gourds in turn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They each held their
gourds and began to drink from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not long after the war
had begun between the Grand Xia and the Seamless Gate, the then-nine
generals had agreed that after each battle, the nine of them would
get together and reflect on the battle and on what they had learned
from it. However, after the battles became increasingly common, it
became rare for Ning and the others to learn anything new from them.
Their teamwork had become nearly perfect, and so their get-togethers
after each battle became drinking sessions. After three years worth
of battles, they had become as close to each other as real siblings,
and had become accustomed to this sort of get-togethers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loachwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand Needles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning silently murmured
these two names.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t feel
quite as close to Celestial Immortal Loachwater, because Loachwater
had died roughly half a year after the start of the war. Although the
two were comrades, their relationship hadn’t had the chance to
reach an extremely deep level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Fairy Thousand
Needles…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present,
including Ning, Unity, and Dustfloat all felt great pain in their
hearts. Celestial Immortal Whacko felt the most pain of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
known all along that Immortals would die as a result of this long
war. Over the past three years, four of their Heaven Punishers had
been crippled. Loachwater had lost his Heaven Punisher during his
very first battle, while Unity had lost his during a battle in the
second month. He had managed to survive, and had received Immortal
reinforcements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly half a year
after the war had started, however, Loachwater had once again had his
Heaven Punisher destroyed. He hadn’t been lucky enough to survive
again; this time, he was slain, along with many of the Loose
Immortals and Celestial Immortals under his command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the number of
Immortals that had been sent to reinforce the Unity Army, there
weren’t many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals in reserve.
And so, this time the Loachwater Army wasn’t rebuilt, and the nine
armies turned into eight armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Afterwards, the army of
Celestial Immortal Allbeasts was also dealt a heavy blow. Allbeasts
himself, however, was lucky enough to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth Heaven
Punisher to be destroyed was that of Fairy Thousand Needles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand Needles.”
Ning sighed to himself. She had just died roughly a month ago. She
had been a rather cold and grim Immortal. After battling by her side
for three years, all of them had grown very close to Thousand
Needles. In fact, they had even learned that Celestial Immortal
Whacko had been wooing her for countless eras, albeit with no
success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after fighting
shoulder-to-shoulder for three years, Celestial Immortal Whacko and
Fairy Thousand Needles had slowly grown very close to each other.
Ning and the others had often teased them for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That a battle like that
would’ve happened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that battle, True
Immortal Azurefox, Empyrean God Threesuns, and Empyrean God
Beastleave had all appeared at the same time. In truth, True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods now often appeared during these battles.
This, however, was the first time True Immortal Azurefox had
personally acted. She was both a True Immortal and an Empyrean God,
her body was that of a powerful Godbeast, and she had a very high
level of insight into the Dao. This was her first time showing her
power, and her power exceeded their expectations, forcing the Xia
Emperor to personally intervene as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, things happened
too quickly in a battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousand Needles
Heaven Punisher was destroyed, and Fairy Thousand Needles died on the
spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant, Whacko
had gone completely mad. Ning and the rest went berserk as well…but
there was nothing they could do. After destroying the Heaven
Punisher, their foes immediately retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt pain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That grim, callous
woman who had shared life-and-death battles with them…the woman who
occasionally revealed a smile in the fact of Whacko’s crazy
antics…that astonishing, beautiful woman…she died, just like
that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you are
the youngest of us; you definitely have to be ranked as our ‘Eighth
Brother’. Come, address me as ‘Second Sister’.” Fairy
Thousand Needles had teased Ning about his age, and the fact that he
was accustomed to addressing her by her name. Roughly a year after
the start of the war, months after the death of Loachwater, the other
eight had grown very close to each other and had sworn oaths of
brotherhood with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was naturally the
youngest, and so they referred to him as ‘eighth’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very rare for
Immortals to swear oaths of brotherhood and sisterhood with each
other, but once the relationship between individuals reached a very
deep level, it was a natural next step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand Needles…”
Ning glanced at Whacko.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whacko and Thousand
Needles had become Dao-companions. Thousand Needles’ death had been
a huge blow to Whacko. In fact…Whacko no longer acted as whacky as
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Yu Wei died…would
I be able to endure that blow?” Ning asked himself. As he did, he
realized that he couldn’t even imagine it…because there was no
way he could endure it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. It’s
time to go back.” Ning raised his head, draining all of the
Immortal wine in his gourd, leaving not a drop behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get a good night’s
rest. We have more battles ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three years of war
had changed them all dramatically. They now loved to sleep, because
sleep could wash away their mental weariness. They no longer had the
graceful Immortal auras of old; rather, they now seemed much more
vulgar, casual, and relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After parting paths
with his seven sworn siblings, Ning returned to his camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals he met on the way back felt deep,
heartfelt veneration for Ning. It had been three years, but the
Darknorth Army had never suffered a serious blow, and that was
because of this peerless figure before them, a man who had trained
for less than a century before becoming a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to his
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had already
prepared a meal for him and was waiting for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You reek of
alcohol,” Yu Wei said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but glance at Yu Wei’s belly. The swell in her belly was already
quite noticeable by now, as it was fairly large. Laughing, he said,
“Our child really is the child of an Empyrean God and a Celestial
Immortal. He’s still staying in his mom’s belly and isn’t
willing to come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The children of Gods
and Immortals can gestate for anywhere from one year to decades,”
Yu Wei laughed. “As for those that are born from the natural world
itself, from Heaven and Earth, its not uncommon for the process to
take trillions of years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for our family to wait that long.” Ning moved closer, pressing his
ear against Yu Wei’s stomach. He could already hear the little
heartbeat from within.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 17 - Kill Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei smiled as she
looked at Ji Ning press his ear to her belly. “How wonderful it
would be if we could always be together like this. Alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An inescapable shadow
lurked deep within Yu Wei’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her membership in the
Seamless Gate had been set in stone during her past life. Her soul
had been marked by the Godking, and there was no way she could resist
at all. In fact, the soul-seal caused her to view the Godking as she
would a father. Although she knew this, it wasn’t possible for her
to feel the slightest bit of hatred. Instead, all she felt was
veneration…but in her heart, she wasn’t willing to harm Ning
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the past
three years of war, Azurefox came to me in my dreams just a single
time, back when things first started. Afterwards, there’s been no
contact at all.” Yu Wei was worried about this. “I wonder when
they will give me another order.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the battles
continued, the allotted time for her and Ji Ning to be together was
drawing to a close as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eventually, there would
come the day when she and Ji Ning had to part their ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that day
doesn’t come too soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that our
child, at least, will be safely born into the world first.” Yu Wei
silently prayed to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Noon the next day. The
Golden Crow hung high in the sky, filled with blazing heat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight Empyrean
Gods/True Immortals were seated here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoists.”
The black-robed, black-haired, red-eyed elder rose to his feet, his
calm voice carrying a bone-chilling cold to it. “Today…is the day
of Ji Ning’s death! I’ll have to trouble you all for your
assistance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, if fellow
Daoist Crimsonjoy manages to kill Ji Ning, the Grand Xia will have
lost its most powerful Heaven Punisher. The impact will be as
significant as the loss of an Empyrean God or a True Immortal.”
True Immortal Whitepole laughed loudly, “If you are able to wipe
out his true body as well, fellow Daoist Crimsonjoy, then you’ll
have rendered even greater merits. I’ll definitely inform the
Godking of your accomplishments.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy shook his head and said calmly, “I’m not completely
confident in being able to slay his true body. If his true body
remains with his Primaltwin, then I’ll be able to kill both at
once! But if it is somewhere else…this time, I’ll probably only
be able to kill the Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew where Ji
Ning’s true body was hiding. Thus, Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
had invited True Immortal Crimsonjoy to kill only the Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The death of the
Primaltwin would mean the loss of a life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a total of two
lives; his true body’s life, and his Primaltwin’s life. Each was
incredibly precious to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning’s true
body was within the underwater estate, and his underwater estate was
with his Primaltwin at all times!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, let’s
head out,” True Immortal Whitepole said, laughing as he rose to his
feet. “If we manage to kill him today, we have to put on a huge
banquet in celebration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, we’ll bear
witness to your prowess, fellow Daoist Crimsonjoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve battled
against Ji Ning countless times, but I haven’t been able to do
anything to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Venomsong
and the others all rose to their feet as well. They all walked away
from the main hall, summoning their respective armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Engage the enemies!”
The Xia Emperor’s voice rang out throughout the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, each of the
armies began to mobilize.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Darknorth
army camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, prepare some food and wait for my return.” Upon
hearing the Xia Emperor’s orders, Ning rose to his feet as well.
“Today, I truly wish to eat ‘Roar of the Nine Snow Dragons’.”
These were all dishes that Yu Wei had personally named. After
becoming a Celestial Immortal, Ning began to prefer vegetables, and
this particular dish was a vegetarian one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, he
immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew away, not
waiting for Yu Wei’s reply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei walked past the
door, watching as Ning appeared with countless figures beside him.
“Come back safely.” Every time Ning went out into battle, Yu Wei
couldn’t help but feel worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” As Ning gave the order, the thousand Celestial
Immortals and hundred thousand Loose Immortals under his command all
executed the formation technique. They looked towards Ning with trust
in their eyes. Over the past three years, Ning’s prestige had
reached a shocking height.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the thirty
thousand meter Fiendgod with no head, the Heaven Punisher, took form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Heaven
Punishers all exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s teach
those little bastards of the Seamless Gate a lesson.” The seven
Heaven Punishers all laughed, then walked out of the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments after the seven
Heaven Punishers vanished, the five Empyrean God golems headed out as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast, desolate,
region that had been ravaged by war. The great lake here had vanished
long ago, and even the majority of the lakewater had been annihilated
by the terrifying battles. The only thing left behind was a few
rivers and small creeks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three White-Faced Flood
Dragons and eight Empyrean God golems were here, calling for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven Heaven Punishers
appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Led by Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon, the forces of the Seamless Gate immediately
charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said. Under Ning’s leadership, the seven Heaven Punishers went
forward into battle as well, and as they did the five Empyrean God
golems of the Grand Xia also emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher was the first to engage, fighting one-on-one against
Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had battled far
too many times by now and were far too familiar with each other. Both
sides knew exactly what abilities the other had, but Ning’s side
still didn’t dare to be overconfident. The main purpose of this
long, drawn-out war was to whittle away and lock down the enemy
forces. At the same time…although the battles were seemingly
pointless and drawn-out, with no one perishing, in reality both sides
were like vipers that were silently waiting for an opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once that opportunity
came…they would reveal their venomous fangs and go for the kill!
The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals that both sides were hiding
would reveal themselves as well, seeking to annihilate part of the
enemy forces at one blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and Unity
joined forces to battle against Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood
Dragon, Ning’s mentally watched the entire battlefield with
incomparable calmness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the past three
years, he had grown much more powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been dancing for
so long at the line separating life and death that it had been of
tremendous benefit to him mastering the Dao of the Sword. His Dao of
the Sword had already reached the bottleneck, and based on his new
insights, Ning had come up with an eleventh stance to the [Three-Foot
Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had made some
progress in researching heartforce as well. Although he hadn’t
reached the ‘expertise’ level which Old Man Yuan had mentioned in
his [Heart Sutra], if Ning was to utilize this technique, he would
instantly be able to unleash three times as much power from his
Heaven Punisher! Given his much greater power and his improved
sword-arts, he was fully capable of reaching a higher level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
even if he increased his power by a full level, he still wouldn’t
be a match for Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I did
unleash my full power, the Seamless Gate would immediately adjust and
compensate for it. It wouldn’t affect the overall scheme of things
at all,” Ning mused to himself. “I have to find a good
opportunity, a perfect opportunity to suddenly unleash my full power
and wipe out yet another White-Faced Flood Dragon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The death of Thousand
Needles had made Ning long for that day even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When she had died, Ning
had wanted save her…but alas, he had been too far away. Even the
Xia Emperor and the others had appeared, but to no avail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the field of battle,
things happened far too quickly. Life and death could be determined
in an instant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to find a
chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
and the seven Empyrean Gods were seated within the main hall, eating
Immortal fruit and drinking Immortal wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is quite the
madman. While his Primaltwin does battle outside, his true body
trains nonstop within the Stellar Hall.” The kind-looking Empyrean
God Dovesnake was holding a cup of wine, smiling merrily as he
watched an image of the outside world. This image had been created by
the giant yellow bear, who was capable of seeing the world outside.
Since the underwater estate was being carried by Ning’s Primaltwin,
it was naturally able to see the battle outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm has
descended upon us. Ji Ning feels pressured, and his child is about to
be born into the storm. Of course he wants to protect Yu Wei and his
child. It makes sense that he is training so frantically,” Empyrean
God Redsnow said with a calm laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true body and the
Primaltwin shared memories with each other, but didn’t disturb or
interfere with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if the Primaltwin
was to completely focus its mind on battle, the true body could still
be completely immersed in training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji Ning’s
strength is increasing stably. His Dao of the Sword has reached a
bottleneck; once he masters it, the time for him to meet his Empyrean
Tribulation will arrive shortly afterwards.” The child-like
Empyrean God Primelight said eagerly, “After he becomes an Empyrean
God, our Starseizing Manor shall once more appear in the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a long,
long time since the name of the Starseizing Manor has been said in
the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods were filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the war in the
Grand Xia had begun, all seven of them had decided to move out from
their world into the underwater estate itself. After all, Ji Ning
might encounter a dangerous situation during the war. If he did meet
with danger and tried to summon them, and they had to first go from
the Starseizer major world to the underwater estate, and then go to
the outside world, valuable time would be wasted, possibly resulting
in Ning’s death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t willing
to take that risk, and so they permanently relocated to the
underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, True Immortals
have appeared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals on both sides have appeared. It seems as though
today’s battle will be interesting to watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. It’s so
boring. They just fight, fight, fight. Only when a large number of
Celestial Immortals or Loose Immortals die do things grow a bit more
interesting,” Empyrean God Sunblaze’s sonorous voice boomed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle had reached
a fever pitch. On the Xia Emperor’s side, True Immortal Dongyan and
Empyrean God Firecloud had both appeared. As for the Seamless Gate,
True Immortal Crimsonjoy and Empyrean God Threesuns had mobilized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True Immortals used
their magic treasures and spells to control the field of battle,
while the Empyrean Gods would alternate between using spells and
engaging in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they were added
into the mix…the entire field of battle grew very chaotic. In
chaos, opportunity could be found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chance. An
opportunity…” As Ning battled carefully, he continued to search
for a chance to kill an enemy with even greater vigilance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The red-eyed
elder, True Immortal Crimsonjoy, pointed a finger from afar.
Instantly, countless black flowers and plants began to emerge from
the earth. These flowers and plants quickly began to wrap themselves
around the feet of the seven Heaven Punishers and the Empyrean God
golems. However, both the Heaven Punishers and the Empyrean God
golems possessed tremendous power, allowing them to break free from
the grip of the plants. Still, their speed was negatively impacted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.” Ning
hated this type of restrictive spell the most. True Immortal
Crimsonjoy would usually only appear once every ten days or so, and
Ning had long since grown accustomed to this sort of plant-based
restrictive spell. Despite that, he couldn’t help but be impacted
by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the distant True
Immortal Crimsonjoy, he was silently murmuring the words to an
incantation in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A speck of golden light
appeared with his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a tiny bit of
the golden liquid from the golden pellet Jindan that was within his
body. It was incredibly precious, and it contained an unbelievably
dense amount of Pure Yang energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Birth.” True
Immortal Crimsonjoy calmly said this word aloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast array of black
flowers and plants that covered the area suddenly began to wither…but
the black flowers and plants that were directly below Ning’s feet
began to suddenly grow at a frantic pace. They rose higher and higher
into the air as well. Previously, they were only a few thousand
meters tall and were only capable of covering the feet of the Heaven
Punishers, but now they increased to more than six thousand meters as
they climbed their way up Ning’s feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, black
chains suddenly appeared within the black flowers and plants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These black chains were
very similar to the black chains which anchored the Seamless City
here. A total of nine of them were present, and they surged into the
skies, many tens of thousand meters long. They wildly twisted out in
circles, wrapping themselves around Ning, carrying a sort of power
that was somehow related to space. Ning used his sword-arts, but was
completely unable to break apart the black chains as they ravenously
wrapped themselves around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Heaven
Punishers were shocked and frantic. They could sense the terrifying
amount of power held within those black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This spell which
Blackheaven taught me really is formidable.” True Immortal
Crimsonjoy didn’t hesitate at all, immediately producing a red jade
bottle within his hands. He aimed it towards the distant Ji Ning,
then roared loudly, “Get in here, now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heaven-shaking
attractive power was suddenly applied to the distant Heaven Punisher,
currently entangled and bound by those nine black chains.
</P>

Chapter 18 - The Final Battle Suddenly Arises
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine black chains
wrapped themselves around Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher, which was
hacking away with two divine swords against them to no avail, causing
just a few spatial ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
saw True Immortal Crimsonjoy pull out that red jade bottle from afar.
Ning didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out!” Ning
had originally been planning to continue to hide his full power in
the hopes of finding an opportunity to deliver the Seamless Gate a
vicious less, but he could no longer afford to do that. Although he
could call out senior Redsnow and the rest of the seven Empyrean Gods
at any time, that was a waste of their tremendous power. Once they
joined forces to form the Seven Planets God, only True Gods or
Daofathers could suppress them. A force like theirs could completely
change the entire course of the war for the Grand Xia. Until things
were absolutely critical, Ning wasn’t willing to use them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two Immortal swords
suddenly appeared out of nowhere, manifesting within Ning’s Heaven
Punisher’s hands. These were two of the top-grade Pure Yang ‘Ananda
World-Swords’. These were true Immortal swords, unlike the
‘Splitter’ artifacts that merely transformed into that shape. As
a result, they were somewhat more powerful when one used sword-arts.
At the same time, and for the first time, Ning applied his heartforce
to his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce served
as the commander, with the power of his soul as its soldiers. In a
very harmonious manner, all of the potential power of the soul was
summoned and applied, and his control over the Heaven Punisher and
the amount of power it could unleash was instantly increased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher instantly more than tripled in strength…and this was with
Ning having yet to even reach the ‘expert’ level in soul
heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! BREAK!”
Ning’s Heaven Punisher wielded the two Ananda World-Swords with
full power as he chopped downwards with them, transforming them into
dazzling streaks of bloody light that transformed into a divine blood
dragon. The two Immortal swords, now appearing to be two enormous
bloody dragons, wildly assaulted the assaulting black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleventh stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] - Dragons Warring in the Wild!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stance encompassed
the profound insights Ning had gained into the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stance encompassed
the eighteen years of wild battles he had experienced in the Nihilum
Zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stance also
encompassed all of the determination and decisiveness Ning had gained
over the course of three years of war on the behalf of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All these things came
together in the eleventh stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]…Ning’s
most powerful sword-art to date! Self-created skills were the best
skills for one’s self, because one would fully understand all the
intricacies and secrets of those skills, as well as be able to
unleash them to an absolutely perfect level. As for sword-arts of
others? Even if you mastered them, you wouldn’t be able to reach a
truly, absolutely perfect level in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True perfection was
only possible for the creator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
two Immortal swords chopped down in the form of divine blood dragons,
assaulting the attacking chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one watched this
scene with the naked eye, it looked as though more than ten blood
dragons were fighting against the countless black chains. Prior to
this, the black chains had carried an aura of unstoppable power. In
the face of that power, Ning had exploded forth with his own full
power. Although the chains remained intact and continued to circle
around Ning, they were now no longer capable of completely binding
him and causing him to be unable to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here, now!”
The distant True Immortal Crimsonjoy lifted up his red jade bottle,
pointing its opening towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful sucking
force was instantly applied to Ning’s Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning just
flexed his knees slightly, putting himself into a stabler stance. The
total amount of power he controlled had just tripled; how could the
jade bottle possibly be able to absorb him away? It couldn’t shake
him at all! If he had been completely bound by and rendered helpless
by those black chains, then the end result would have been him being
sucked away, but this was no longer the case; although the chains
remained powerful, he was able to fight back against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” True
Immortal Crimsonjoy stared at Ning from afar, his face a mask of
shock. “He actually…actually was hiding his own power as well?
What a Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a life-and-death
battle, one of the things to be feared the most was when an enemy was
hiding his true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when you fully
knew all of your foe’s secrets could you lay down a good plan for
dealing with him! If the foe was much more powerful than anticipated,
the plan would be destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitepole, Azurefox,
hurry up and join in,” True Immortal Crimsonjoy sent mentally.
“This Ji Ning was hiding his full power. Even after I consumed some
of my own Jindan essence, I’m only able to temporarily keep him
locked down. I’m unable to suck him away into the bottle. Now, the
rest is up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
made a very meticulous plan this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If True Immortal
Crimsonjoy had succeeded, that would be well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he failed…his
abilities would most likely still have caused the Grand Xia’s side
to be put at a great disadvantage. This allowed the other members of
the Seamless Gate to launch a truly ferocious strike against them!
They would seize the opportunity to deal the Grand Xia a heavy blow;
in fact, if the blow was heavy enough, the Grand Xia might no longer
be able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
had been quietly preparing amidst an army of Seamless Gate soldiers
within a minor world treasure. He immediately roared out the command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the mighty
army of the Seamless Gate appeared in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone appeared. The
Empyrean Gods, the True Immortals, the likes of Gatemaster
Azurefox…even True Immortal Whitepole himself appeared for the
first time! At the same time, two types of towering, thirty thousand
meter Empyrean God golems appeared as well. The first was the
ordinary, often-used Empyrean God golem that was completely black and
horned, the one which Ning’s side had as well. As for the second,
it was semi-translucent, glowed with a dull bloody light, and was
slightly thinner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six of the old black
Empyrean God golems emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixteen of the new
blood-colored Empyrean God golems emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe them out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Whitepole’s white eyebrows were fluttering about. His grim face
looked even colder than usual, but his eyes were filled with madness.
He gave the order coldly, and his voice echoed within the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Empyrean God
golems?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia’s side
was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
guessed that the Seamless Gate was holding back, they hadn’t
expected for the Seamless Gate to be holding back such a terrifying
force for so long! Six black Empyrean God golems and sixteen
blood-red Empyrean God golems…how terrifying a force was this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Xia Emperor himself had just barely been able to procure
three such golems, and only of the black variant at that. He hadn’t
acquired a single one of the blood-colored golems, which were on a
higher level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning wielded his Ananda World-Swords, still struggling against the
black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful of
the seven Heaven Punishers, the Darknorth Heaven Punisher, had been
completely locked down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t just Ji
Ning who was stunned. Celestial Immortal Unity and the other Heaven
Punishers…even the Xia Emperor was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing that Ning
was in danger, the Xia Emperor had been extremely worried, and so he
had immediately sent out his forces to assist. Although all seven
Heaven Punishers were important, the one they could least afford to
lose was Ji Ning’s. Ji Ning’s sole Heaven Punisher was worth two
or three other Heaven Punishers! In addition, once Ning overcame the
Empyrean Tribulation, he would possess tremendous influence. A
peerless genius who was capable of reaching the Empyrean God level of
power as a Void-level Fiendgod…once he made his breakthrough, how
powerful would he be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the Xia Emperor
absolutely would not permit him to be lost. He personally entered the
field of battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he appeared,
before he even had a chance to help Ji Ning, he saw that Ji Ning had
managed to stave off defeat by himself. “So Ji Ning was hiding his
power? Excellent.” The Xia Emperor was delighted and surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at that
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main army of the
Seamless Gate emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” When the
Xia Emperor looked at the awe-inspiring horde of Seamless Gate
soldiers, his face couldn’t help but change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had guessed all
along that the Seamless Gate had to have been hiding many Celestial
Immortals, because three of the four White-Faced Flood Dragons had
been formed from Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals that had
betrayed the Grand Xia! Most likely, only the one which Empyrean God
Venomsong commanded consisted of the Seamless Gate’s own forces.
Was that all the Seamless Gate had? Impossible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But not even the Xia
Emperor had expected so many Empyrean God golems to emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems they really
do view my Grand Xia with great importance. They actually sent out so
many of their precious Empyrean God golems. There’s even sixteen of
those incredibly difficult-to-deal-with Bloodcloud golems.” The Xia
Emperor’s gaze turned cold. “If that’s the case…then let’s
fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Coldsavage, Empyrean God Kindwater, Empyrean God Northwatch, emerge!”
The Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor had an
extremely high status. His Grand Xia could be considered the most
powerful major world under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright! He
also had the Primordial Imperial Clan and Daofather Raindragon behind
him, and was himself quite powerful as well. After having ruled for
so many years, how could his own forces possibly be weak? It must be
understood that the even likes of the Mount Stele major world, which
had been conquered long ago, had three to five Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the likes of
Empyrean God Kindwater, who had always been rather disrespectful
towards the Xia Emperor, had long ago moved to stand by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Coldsavage
was the Empyrean God that had arisen amongst the ranks of the native
Fiendgods of the Grand Xia. He had signed a pact with the Xia Emperor
to serve him in battle for a hundred thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Northwatch
was a transcendent figure. Much like how the Xia Emperor had helped
Ji Ning out, the Xia Emperor had also once helped out Empyrean God
Northwatch. Now that Northwatch was an Empyrean God, he naturally
wanted to repay his debt and show his gratitude. At a critical moment
like this, he chose to stand firmly on the side of the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an extremely
vast world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the world of
flames where the countless Fiendgods had been imprisoned for many
years. However, the world of flames no longer delivered any
punishments to them. Over the past period of time, the countless
Fiendgods had all been focusing on training in a truly ancient
Fiendgod formation…the Pangu War-Formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu War-formation
was the most ancient and most complicated of Fiendgod formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Pangu had
established the universe and perished, all of the surviving major
powers such as Mother Nuwa had felt utter veneration towards him.
Back then, Mother Nuwa had been far from reaching Pangu’s level.
Due to the veneration the Fiendgods felt towards Pangu, as well as
the gratitude they felt towards him for his establishment of the
universe, many of the war-formations which the Fiendgods used when
they engaged in battle ended up being named ‘Pangu War-Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
different Pangu War-Formations, and many other major powers would
often work to improve and perfect them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Mother Nuwa
had herself broken through to Pangu’s level and further improved a
Pangu War-Formation. Only then was it truly perfected! Only the few
top-tier major powers knew all of the marvelous secrets of this
war-formation, and the total number could be counted with just two
hands. Amongst that number were Suiren and Fuxi of the Primordial
Imperial Clan, as well as a few of the other extremely ancient Human
Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The version the Xia
Emperor had acquired was naturally a simplified version. However, the
simplified version was more than enough for this army of mere
Void-level Fiendgods and Primal Fiendgods, commanded by a single
Empyrean God. They wouldn’t be able to properly use the more
profound versions, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Fiendgods
were under the command of Empyrean God Coldsavage, Empyrean God
Northwatch, and Empyrean God Kindwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could form into
three mighty Pangu War-Formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean Gods
Coldsavage, Kindwater, and Northwatch, make your move.” The Xia
Emperor’s voice rang out within the world of flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for us to act.”
Empyrean God Coldsavage instantly grew excited. Raising his head, he
let out a heroic roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FIGHT!” “FIGHT!”
“FIGHT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, countless
Fiendgods grew so excited that their eyes turned red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were Fiendgods.
They were born to battle against Heaven and Earth; the desire to do
battle was bred into the bones of each and every one of them. After
having been imprisoned for countless ages, they were absolutely
thirsting for a fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EMERGE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An awe-inspiring flood
of Fiendgods began to move, divided up into three armies. In the air
above each army began to appear an enormous, seemingly-solid
manifestation of a barefoot, loose-haired figure with an utterly
enormous greataxe. This was the most ancient of primordial
divinities…Pangu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Fiendgods
were all teleported out of this world to the field of battle.

Chapter 19 - Consecutive Demises
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the army of
Fiendgods had quickly assembled into the Pangu War-Formations and
then immediately head out, it still took a short period of time.
Within that short period of time…the forces that the Seamless Gate
had sent out, consisting of True Immortal Whitepole, Gatemaster
Azurefox, the other Empyrean Gods/True Immortals, the sixteen
Bloodcloud golems, and the six black Empyrean God golems, all began
to act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six black Empyrean
God golems immediately charged towards their allies, moving to unite
with the other eight Empyrean God golems and the three White-Faced
Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sea of Blood is
boundless…” The skinny Hallmaster of Bloodcloud Hall immediately
executed his spell, causing bloody waves to began to surge forth from
the area surrounding him. The seemingly endless waves of blood filled
the entire region. The White-Faced Flood Dragons and Empyrean God
golems of the Seamless Gate weren’t hampered by it, and were even
aided by it. As for the Heaven Punishers and the five Empyrean God
golems of the Grand Xia, they felt tremendously impeded by the
endless waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little children…”
Gatemaster Azurefox stood there in midair, her robes fluttering. She
pointed off into the distance, and instantly a blurred image of an
enormous, bushy, azure-colored tail appeared behind her. At the same
time, countless azure strands of silk spread out from her tail,
covering the skies and coiling towards the Grand Xia’s forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One withers, one
blooms.” True Immortal Skyfarmer immediately went into battle-mode,
a smile still on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Green grass suddenly
began to grow throughout the vast, desolate wilderness. The grass was
merely ordinary wild grass, but it contained tremendous vitality and
life energy. Despite the waves of blood and the azure silk strands
that filled the region, the countless strands of wild grass still
forcibly grew their way out and began to oscillate wildly in the air.
All by himself, True Immortal Skyfarmer had blocked the spells of the
Hallmaster and Gatemaster Azurefox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The frenzied wild grass
quickly began to wither at an astonishing rate…but then, they began
to regrow just as fast. They withered and they regrew nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Drip-drop.” True
Immortal Dongyan had a casual smile on his face. Instantly, drops of
water began to fall from the heavens. As the raindrops fell upon the
earth, they emitted drip-drop sounds. When they landed on the forces
of the Grand Xia, they caused no damage at all, but each time a
raindrop struck a member of the Seamless Gate, it would carry
tremendous smashing power, causing their bodies to visibly tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pure Yang True
Immortals on both sides had executed their spells and incantations,
doing their best to impede and slow down their foes while protecting
their own forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In battle, cooperation
was paramount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they just stupidly
attacked each other blindly…neither the Grand Xia nor the Seamless
Gate would be able to unleash their full power and potential. When a
Pure Yang True Immortal completely focused his efforts on casting
spells, he would be of tremendous benefit to their entire side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen skinny,
blood-colored Empyrean God golems all moved in utter silence, causing
just a few spatial ripples with their movements as they streaked
forward like bloody rays of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their speed is
incredible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their speed is at
least double ours. How can this be?!” The six Heaven Punishers and
the five Empyrean God golems on the side of the Grand Xia had
previously been able to maintain their calm as they fought, but now
they instantly began to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twice as fast? What did
that represent?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that in a life-and-death battle, if your enemy was just slightly
faster than you, it meant that it would be very hard for you to
escape. Twice as fast? Their foes would be able to toy with them with
impunity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic.
Although those Bloodcloud golems are extremely vast, they are very
fragile! If two of you join forces to launch a joint strike, you’ll
be able to completely destroy a Bloodcloud golem. Even a single
Heaven Punisher fighting alone will be able to damage it with an
attack,” the Xia Emperor sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals on the Xia Emperor’s side were all casting spells to
the best of their ability, attempting to slow down the Bloodcloud
golems. However, although the power of their spells was causing the
Bloodcloud golems’ speed to drop, the golems remained 50% faster
than the Heaven Punishers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous, dense mass
of figures suddenly appeared in the air. Countless Fiendgods had
suddenly appeared, forming together like three massive black
stormclouds. Above each of the three enormous black stormclouds,
there was a massive, barefoot giant who held a titanic greataxe in
his hands. Their unearthly auras filled the heavens, instantly
causing the entire battlefield to grow still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangu?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present,
including the likes of Unity and Ji Ning, who had never before seen
Pangu or this formation, felt inexplicably certain in their hearts
that the barefoot, greataxe-wielding giants had to be Pangu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant’s radiated
a natural, innate aura of majesty, as though everything within Heaven
and Earth had to submit before it. Most likely, aside from the
legendary Pangu, only Mother Nuwa was capable of such an aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the aura of
the Pangu that was manifested through the Pangu War-Formation was
very weak compared to the real thing, it still possessed a quality of
absolute transcendence, an aura which not even Ning’s master,
Patriarch Subhuti, possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Empyrean God Coldsavage, one of the commanders of the black
stormclouds, began to laugh loudly. He stared downwards at the
towering figures before him, their powerful auras filling him with a
desire to do battle. “Children, we’ve been waiting and enduring
for countless years…for far too long! Today, let’s let the
Seamless Gate get a taste of how formidable we Fiendgods are!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let them taste our
might!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Murder them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe them all out!
Eat them all alive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Fiendgods
all bellowed furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been tormented
for countless years, and today they were going to give full vent to
their dark desires. Empyrean God Coldsavage’s voice echoed within
the ears of each Fiendgod. Although the countless Fiendgods had been
divided into three parts, Empyrean God Coldsavage’s influence was
unquestionable; he was the true and only leader of the Fiendgods
native to the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three giant black
stormclouds instantly began to charge downwards with savage, killing
glee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are this
powerful?!” The faces of True Immortal Whitepole, Gatemaster
Azurefox, and the others all changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The intelligence
abilities of the Seamless Gate were truly formidable. Word had
already come from above: “The Fiendgods native to the Grand Xia
have already submitted to the Xia Emperor.” This single line was
all they had been given; True Immortal Whitepole and the others could
only do their best to try and guess at what it meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t know
exactly how powerful the native Fiendgods were, but they definitely
weren’t weak. As for asking their superiors for more information?
They didn’t dare to do that. The person who sent them these
intelligence reports had an incredibly exalted status; compared to
the major power of the Seamless Gate who sent these intelligence
reports, even their Godking was on a lower level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The locations of
countless Celestial Tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless other types
of intelligence reports.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That mysterious
figure…it continually transmitted countless intelligence reports to
them in a methodical, almost machine-like way. In terms of
intelligence gathering, the Seamless Gate was supreme within the
Three Realms, precisely because of that mysterious major power! There
was no way that mysterious presence could possibly explain every
single report in detail. How to make use of the reports? How to take
advantage of them? What actions to take? Gatemaster Azurefox and the
others had to make those decisions on their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this war
isn’t going to be an easy one to fight,” the Cavemaster of the
Myriad Demons Cave sent mentally. “With three Empyrean Gods leading
them…their power is not at all inferior to Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have to
fight, even if it isn’t easy.” True Immortal Whitepole’s eyes
flashed with cold light. “We have to take over the Grand Xia. All
those that block us must be wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Gatemaster
Azurefox sent in agreement, “We have to take over the Grand Xia.
The Xia Emperor really is formidable; he’s one of the three chiefs
of the Crimsonbright Realm. I knew long ago that attacking his Grand
Xia would be very difficult…but his status makes our conquest of
him even more important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimsonbright Realm
referred to the dozens of major worlds and countless minor worlds
commanded by Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The highest ranking
member of the Crimsonbright Realm was naturally Daofather
Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next came the three
chiefs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals were ranked one level below the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why were those three
referred to as ‘chiefs’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘chiefs’ of a
realm usually had around ten Empyrean Gods or True Immortals who
followed them! Someone who could command ten Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals was naturally no ordinary figure. After Ning became an
Empyrean God, he would have those seven Empyrean Gods following him,
and so he could be considered a chief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if he
was just by himself, his status would naturally be on a lower level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even someone on Lu Dongbin’s level, when faced with the Seven
Planets God led by Empyrean God Redsnow, would have no choice but to
flee if he was by himself. This was what made the chiefs so powerful!
They are absolute hegemons below the True God/Daofather level, and if
they took over a major world, their rule over it would be absolute.
No Empyrean Gods or True Immortals would dare meddle within it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, Lu Dongbin
was even more powerful than the Xia Emperor; he had the Eight
Immortals of the High Caves by his side, as well as other followers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To attack and defeat
the world which was governed by one of the three chiefs of the
Crimsonbright Realm, the Xia Emperor…of course it was hard. But
that made it even more important to succeed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen Bloodcloud
golems moved at incredible speed. The three Pangu War-Formations, the
Heaven Punishers, the other Empyrean God golems…none could match up
to them. The Bloodcloud golems moved like streaks of light as they
surged towards the six Heaven Punishers. As for Ji Ning? Ning was
still locked in place by True Immortal Crimsonjoy, who was in turn
occupied with locking him down through the consumption of his Pure
Yang energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that this was a spell that was created by Crimsonjoy consuming some
of his own Jindan essence. He wasn’t willing to release the spell
without a very good reason, and so he had been maintaining it the
entire time. If nothing else, by maintaining the spell, he was
locking down the most powerful of the Heaven Punishers, Ji Ning’s;
that was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
Bloodcloud golems wildly assaulted the six Heaven Punishers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying flood of
Fiendgods charged into the fray.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
dark stormcloud of Fiendgods, one of the massive Pangus swung out
with an arm. The arm was many tens of thousands of meters long. One
of the Bloodcloud golems tried to dodge, but was still struck by it
in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodcloud golem’s
body completely blew apart in midair, all of the Celestial Immortals
inside having perished from the shockwaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the Seamless
Gate’s forces remained cold and clear-minded. This was the fatal
weakness of the Bloodcloud golems; they were too fragile! They
possessed terrifying speed, but they were easily destroyed. Each of
the three Fiendgod armies were comparable to Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon, and so a full-force strike was more than
enough to destroy a Bloodcloud golem. Once the golem was destroyed,
the hundred Celestial Immortals within it would naturally all perish
from the shockwaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Rainbow!”
The Xia Emperor’s face changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rainbow Heaven
Punisher had just been knocked flying by Venomsong’s White-Faced
Flood Dragon. Suddenly, four Bloodcloud golems pounced straight
towards it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodcloud golems
were simply too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Xia
Emperor and the others were all present, by the time they noticed the
danger…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Fiendgod
body of the Heaven Punisher was completely ripped apart, revealing
the many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals within.
</P>

Chapter 20 - The Grand Xia’s Worldguard Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
and Loose Immortals fled like mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Bloodcloud
golems butchered the surviving Celestial Immortals and Loose
Immortals. In the past, when a Heaven Punisher was destroyed by a
White-Faced Flood Dragon, only a single one of them would be
available to butcher the survivors. Now, however, four Bloodcloud
golems were massacring them together! Although the Bloodcloud golems
were somewhat weaker than the White-Faced Flood Dragons, they were
much faster and possessed more than enough power to effortlessly
murder these Celestial Immortals. Given that there were four of
them…in but the blink of an eye, all one thousand Celestial
Immortals were completely wiped out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not one of them
escaped!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even those who hid
themselves within Immortal estates were immediately captured by those
Bloodcloud golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Empyrean
God Kindwater let out a furious roar as he led his massive Fiendgod
army in an attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainbow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixth brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the other
Heaven Punishers became bloodshot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had all happened too
fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when they
encountered dangerous situations while battling against the
White-Faced Flood Dragons, the Xia Emperor and the others would have
enough time to intervene and help out. However, when the Rainbow
Heaven Punisher suffered attacks from four Bloodcloud golems, there
wasn’t even a chance to rescue them. The Rainbow Heaven Punisher
was shattered in the blink of an eye, and in the next blink its
Immortals were all massacred. It was far, far too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixth brother.”
Ning’s eyes were bloodshot as well. It had all happened too fast.
No one had been able to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning brandished the
Ananda World-Swords with his two hands, wildly assaulting the black
chains around him. The distant True Immortal Crimsonjoy continued to
strive to maintain the spell. Grinding his teeth, he thought to
himself, “This Ji Ning really is a madman. He knows he can’t
break out, but he continues to attack in such wild fashion.” His
Pure Yang energy was continuing to deplete, while Ning was using up
even more natural energy of Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Crimsonjoy.” Ning felt greater and greater hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of these
black chains was simply tremendous…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly wanted to
ask the seven Empyrean Gods to come out. Given that the Grand Xia and
the Seamless Gate were roughly on par, they could strike a decisive
blow that would change the entire tempo of this war. However, the
seven had only promised to help him out a single time. This was
equivalent to providing Ning with a second life, if they were used to
save him at a critical moment. In addition, even though Ning was
truly enraged, his mastery of heartforce had reached the ruler level,
and so he was able to remain completely calm; he wouldn’t act
rashly due to his rage. The seven Empyrean Gods would be a
tremendously powerful card to play; now was not the time to play
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
battle between the Grand Xia and the Seamless Gate clearly had not
reached the climax yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were to master
the Dao of the Sword…how wonderful that would be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break apart, damn
you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to use
his sword-arts to frenetically assault the black chains, making it so
that they were completely unable to coil around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Fiendgod
armies were the most savage and most berserk forces on the side of
the Grand Xia. The Pangu War-Formations possessed enormous,
astonishing power. They were were also utterly gigantic, with their
hands alone being greater than the Heaven Punishers in size. Thus,
sometimes the Bloodcloud golems found it difficult to avoid the
mighty palms and greataxes of the Pangus, even though the golems were
very fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whether they were
struck by axes or by palms, the Bloodcloud golems would instantly
shatter apart, the Celestial Immortals inside perishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, an
enormous explosion would be heard as yet another Bloodcloud golem
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
watched from far away, a cold look on his face. Although he had
expected that he would lose many of the Bloodcloud golems, the rate
at which they were being destroyed in this battle against the Grand
Xia was far too fast! This was mainly because the three Pangu
War-Formations took up far too much space. Although they were
somewhat slower in moving and advancing, they were still extremely
fast when striking with their arms and greataxes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
light flashed through True Immortal Whitepole’s eyes as his gaze
locked onto the Fiendgod army led by Empyrean God Coldsavage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh! Suddenly,
thirty-six snow-white Immortal swords appeared behind True Immortal
Whitepole. These thirty-six Immortal swords joined together, forming
into an enormous circle in midair. Power exploded forth from them, as
the thirty-six Immortal swords transformed into an enormous Solar
Star, but one that radiated an aura of icy coldness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A billowing cold. A
penetrating, bone-deep cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the vast
wilderness began to quickly freeze as a layer of frost appeared on
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s finally
making his move.” The Xia Emperor had been keeping an eye on True
Immortal Whitepole this entire time. He had been able to sense the
threat which Whitepole posed to him; in fact, Whitepole was the only
person on the side of the entire Seamless Gate alliance that gave the
Xia Emperor a feeling of danger. Thus, the Xia Emperor understood
that True Immortal Whitepole, who had always been so low-key, was the
most powerful member of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Xia
Emperor had cast some supportive spells as well, he had mainly been
focusing on True Immortal Whitepole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that True Immortal
Whitepole was making his move, his move was sure to be shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitepole’s
World!” True Immortal Whitepole was at the very center of this icy
sun, as though he was its master. He then pointed at the distant
Fiendgod army led by Empyrean God Coldsavage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A freezing lance of
light instantly shot through the skies, flying straight towards
Empyrean God Coldsavage’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Coldsavage
raised his head, letting out a savage bellow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instead, the towering
Pangu figure above his Fiendgod army also let out a furious roar as
it swung its greataxe. BOOM! Although a layer of frost appeared on
the surface of the greataxe, the attack was still blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” True
Immortal Coldsavage smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, countless
lances of silvery-white light shot through the air, assaulting the
Fiendgod army of Empyrean God Coldsavage. The area around the
Fiendgod army transformed into an icy hell-trap. Even space itself
began to freeze, and a layer of ice appeared on the towering body of
Pangu as well. However, all of the Fiendgods roared in response,
summoning their divine power to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of their power had
been fully merged together; they were completely fearless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“RAAAWR!” Empyrean
God Coldsavage went berserk. The Pangu above him cleaved downwards
with the greataxe, using its terrifying power to block the countless
lances of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, this Fiendgod
army had been completely stalemated by True Immortal Whitepole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single Pure Yang
True Immortal, all by himself, is actually able to stalemate a Pangu
War-Formation led by an Empyrean God commanding countless Fiendgods.”
The forces of the Grand Xia were shocked. It must be understood that
nobody on the side of the Grand Xia dared to claim that they could
single-handedly stop the White-Faced Flood Dragon led by Venomsong.
Even the likes of Empyrean God Firecloud, who had once managed to tie
down Venomsong’s Terrorbeast, had been sent flying with each clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But True Immortal
Whitepole had done it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect.” The Xia
Emperor’s eyes lit up. “This is the moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The empty space around
the black-robed Xia Emperor seemed to implode. With him at the
center, an area of three hundred meters around him became covered in
absolute darkness. The space within this region began to collapse,
twist, and swirl about. And then, from the field of absolute
darkness, a black dragon began to crawl outwards. When this black
dragon emerged, it blinked its golden eyes and stared at its
surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAAAAR!” An
earth-shaking draconic howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, one black
dragon after another came crawling out of the field of absolute
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dawn of All
Creatures!” The black-robed Xia Emperor growled out, his gaze
turning savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of nine black
dragons came crawling out from the darkness, filled with auras of
tremendous power. They then began to sinuously slither forward,
moving at high speed as they assaulted the distant Bloodcloud golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a secret art
that the Primordial Imperial Clan never taught to outsiders. At his
current level of power, the Xia Emperor was just barely able to use
the first level of this technique. If it were the major powers of the
Primordial Imperial Clan who used this art, they would be able to
release ten thousand black dragons at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox, go help
those Bloodcloud golems.” Seeing the situation, True Immortal
Whitepole immediately sent a mental message. He was quite shocked
upon seeing the Xia Emperor use this secret art. It must be
understood that his intelligence reports hadn’t included a list of
all techniques which the Xia Emperor used. As for this secret art,
the ‘Dawn of All Creatures’, it was incredibly difficult to
learn, and the Primordial Imperial Clan never taught it to outsiders.
He hadn’t expected that the Xia Emperor would actually be able to
use the first level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those nine black
dragons were comparable to nine Empyrean God golems, and incredibly
fast ones at that! Once the Bloodcloud golems were tied down, then
the two active Fiendgod armies and the various Heaven Punishers would
be able to destroy them with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Seeing
the situation, Azurefox didn’t dare hesitate; she immediately went
all out, transforming into an enormous azure fox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure fox stood
there in the air, blue light billowing from its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her tail suddenly
divided from one tail into nine tails. The nine enormous azure fox
tails suddenly blasted out in each direction, chasing after those
nine black dragons. Gatemaster Azurefox wasn’t actually one of the
legendary nine-tailed foxes, the most exalted of all foxes. As an
Empyrean God, however, she could temporarily change into a
nine-tailed form, although her power was still a bit weaker than that
of the true, legendary nine-tailed foxes. Still, she was able to die
down the Xia Emperor for a time and give the Bloodcloud golems some
breathing space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she was a true
nine-tailed fox, and an Empyrean God at that, she’d probably be
able to rely on her natural abilities alone to give the Xia Emperor a

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In reality…she wasn’t
quite there yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. The main hall of the imperial Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor stood at the highest point of the Skylight Palace, staring
down at the vast world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus far, the
Seamless Gate has sent in less than ten thousand Celestial Immortals
into battle, including the ones already killed. They’ve mainly been
relying on their Empyrean God golems and their Bloodcloud golems,
which is why they’ve been able to stalemate my Grand Xia.” The
white-robed Xia Emperor murmured softly to himself, “These ten
thousand Celestial Immortals…three thousand of them joined them
from my Grand Xia. In other words, the total number of Celestial
Immortals that originally belonged to the Seamless Gate was actually
even less, perhaps only around six or seven thousand. And this can’t
be the full power the Seamless Gate possesses. To assault my Grand
Xia…the Seamless Gate led by Azurefox must have prepared many
Celestial Immortals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you aren’t
willing to bring them out…I’ll force them out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor knew quite well that if a dagger remained hidden in the
darkness, it might appear at any moment in a lethal strike. Only by
forcing the dagger out into the open could he feel at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor reached out with his right hand, spots of glimmering black
light appearing with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Skylight
Palace…in fact, the entire imperial citadel…began to shake. The
runes and ley-lines of the plaza that had existed for countless years
began to glow, and the Skylight Palace itself began to be covered
with dazzling, flowing black light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Grand Xia
was at war, the ancient city of Stillwater was quite calm. This
wasn’t the place where the war was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Stillwater
City began to shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entirety of
Stillwater City suddenly began to glow with light. The countless rays
of light circulated in the air above Stillwater City as an aura of
absolute might soared into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flamedoor City saw the
same pillar of light surge into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless cities
throughout the 3600 commanderies of the entire Grand Xia suddenly
began to unleash an unearthly amount of power. This power was even
beginning to emanate from Whitepole City, which was located directly
below the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skylight Palace of
the imperial citadel as the core, and the 3600 capitals of the
various commanderies as the formation-bases. Long ago, Daofather
Raindragon had personally crafted the Grand Xia’s Worldguard
Formation…and now, it had been truly activated. This was a
formation which the Xia Emperor had asked Daofather Raindragon to
create after the marquis-led rebellions. Ever since its creation, no
one in the Grand Xia had ever dared to rebel again…until this time,
that is.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After countless years
of silence, the Grand Xia’s Worldguard Formation was once more
revealing its might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
white-robed Xia Emperor stood guard at the Skylight Palace over the
core of the Worldguard Formation, summoning its power and sending it
towards the field of battle in Whitepole Commandery.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whitepole Commandery.
The vast, wild field of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between the
Seamless Gate and the Grand Xia had reached a fever point, with both
sides comparable in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia’s
Darknorth Heaven Punisher and the Seamless Gate’s True Immortal
Crimsonjoy had tied each other down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other five
Heaven Punishers and five Empyrean God golems of the Grand Xia, they
were being assaulted by the two White-Faced Flood Dragons, six
Empyrean God golems, and Bloodcloud golems of the Seamless Gate.
Those Bloodcloud golems in particular…they moved in unfathomable,
mysterious ways, causing the five Heaven Punishers to suffer greatly.
Fortunately, the other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were
assisting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, in
particular, was able to lock down more than half of the Bloodcloud
golems; otherwise, more Heaven Punishers would have fallen by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful force
on the side of the Grand Xia was the three Fiendgod armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, one of the
armies had been stalemated and locked down by True Immortal
Whitepole, while the other was engaged in battle against the
White-Faced Flood Dragon. The final one was being assaulted and
completely tied down by eight of the Empyrean God golems of the
Seamless Gate. Unlike the Bloodcloud golems, the black Empyrean God
golems were a bit slow, but were very tough to destroy, and so they
managed to render this Fiendgod army unable to do anything to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the moment, both
sides were battling at a furious stalemate. Neither side was able to
destroy the other; both sides needed additional reinforcements to
disrupt the balance and wipe out their foes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the six Heaven
Punishers, Ji Ning was feeling the most miserable, because he had
been completely locked down by True Immortal Crimsonjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
sensed a powerful ripple of natural energy. He couldn’t help but
look towards the skies. And not just him; everyone present could
sense that terrifyingly powerful ripple of energy, and raised their
heads to stare at the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying power was
gathering within the air, manifesting in the form of a dark-red
cloud. It was like a tribulation cloud, filled with flickering red
light and with power great enough to strike fear into the hearts of
the viewers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Worldguard
Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
Worldguard Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor has
activated the Worldguard Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
forces felt their hearts clench, while the Grand Xia’s side felt
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fame of the Grand
Xia’s Worldguard Formation was simply too great. Even Ning had
heard of it long ago, back when he had taken part in the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny. However, back then he hadn’t been certain as to
exactly how strong it was. Afterwards, when his status became higher,
he learned some details and particulars of this formation. The Grand
Xia’s Worldguard Formation was led through the imperial Skylight
Palace and supported by the 3600 commandery cities. The power of the
3600 cities would be gathered in one location, but the energy could
be used to attack any location within the Grand Xia!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the tribulation
cloud appeared, space would be locked. There wouldn’t even be a way
to escape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for its power…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
would definitely perish. As for Empyrean Gods and True Immortals,
Empyrean Gods with powerful bodies and protective divine abilities
might be able to survive, but Pure Yang True Immortals were almost
guaranteed to perish! The power of this formation vastly outstripped
the Xia Emperor’s own power. It was precisely because the
Worldguard Formation was created that the various marquises no longer
dared to ever rebel again. So long as they were within the world of
the Grand Xia, there would be no way for them to avoid the attacks of
the Worldguard Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were unable to
forget…that time when they saw the Worldguard Formation release its
power. It had immediately slain the leader of the rebels, a Pure Yang
True Immortal known as True Immortal Quhai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about time.”
True Immortal Whitepole raised his head, watching with a cold smile
on his face. In his hands, however, a gray fruit suddenly appeared.
He crushed the gray fruit with his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh! Suddenly, a
large amount of gray gas flew out of the gray fruit. Instantly, the
vast flood of gray gas began to soar into the heavens, wrapping
itself around the dark-red tribulation clouds in the air!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Xia
Emperor frowned, then smiled coldly and barked, “The power of
primordial chaos? Whitepole, do you think that a tiny bit of chaos
power, diluted into gaseous state, is capable of withstanding my
formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of primordial
chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You had to begin
training in the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos before you could
slowly begin to learn to master it. This was truly the most supreme
form of power that existed within the Three Realms. Generally
speaking, after True Gods or Daofathers mastered a single Heavenly
Dao, they would then begin to slowly work on understanding the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos. After all, of the ten great
Heavenly Daos, the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos reigned
absolutely supreme. Anyone capable of mastering it would reach the
supreme level which Pangu had been at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, Pangu had
mastered this Heavenly Dao. Mother Nuwa was even more formidable; of
the ten Heavenly Daos, she had mastered nine of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a saying that
there were 108,000 Daos in the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had
mastered 84,000 Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
see how incredible she was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that Mother
Nuwa couldn’t master the final Heavenly Dao, it was that the
Heavenly Daos themselves were flawed and incomplete. There was no way
at all to completely and thoroughly understand all of them at the
same time. Mastering nine Heavenly Daos was a limit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I admit that
your Worldguard Formation is formidable, and this truly is just a
sliver of chaos power.” True Immortal Whitepole laughed loudly, a
hint of satire in his eyes. “But even though it is just a
sliver…it’s a sliver of primordial chaos! How much power will
this formation of yours possess, after it is forced to go through it?
In addition, given how powerful this Worldguard Formation is, and
given that it covers your entire major world and vastly surpasses the
level of power a True Immortal should possess…I imagine that each
time you activate it, you have to pay a considerable price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
received intelligence reports about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every century, the Xia
Emperor could at most use the Worldguard Formation twice. True
Immortal Whitepole had personally asked his master about this, and
the Godking had said, “This formation is so vast, it goes beyond
the bounds of normal power for Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. An
attack that can encompass and envelope an entire world…this is
something on the level of a True God or a Daofather. The main reason
why Raindragon forged this formation was to shock and awe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since even the
intelligence reports say that the Xia Emperor can at most use this
formation twice every century, then I imagine that he should normally
only be able to use it once. If he’s willing to pay an enormous
price, he can probably use it twice. I’ll bestow upon you a fruit
of primordial chaos which can weaken the strength of his formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Xia
Emperor stared downwards coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribulation cloud
of the Worldguard Formation previously held enough power to slaughter
any of the True Immortals of the Seamless Gate that were present. The
Empyrean Gods might have been able to survive the strike of the
tribulation cloud, thanks to their divine bodies and protective
divine abilities, but the True Immortals were almost guaranteed to
perish. The Xia Emperor had been planning on using this to assault
True Immortal Whitepole, but now that the tribulation cloud was
covered by the power of primordial chaos…most likely, the strength
of the tribulation cloud would be greatly weakened after passing
through it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was easy to beat
back an expert on the level of True Immortal Whitepole, but very hard
to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals all had very formidable life-preserving techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew that the
Seamless Gate had to have prepared something, but I didn’t imagine
that the Daofather behind True Immortal Whitepole would actually give
him a Dao-fruit of primordial chaos. This Daofather is quite
generous.” The Xia Emperor felt tremendous resentment. Fruits of
chaos power were also known as Dao-fruits of primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not all True Gods or
Daofathers could easily condense the power of primordial chaos into
the form of a fruit. If they really could do that, given that they
could easily replenish their own chaos energy, Dao-fruits of
primordial chaos would be everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In reality…to form a
Dao-fruit of primordial chaos, the creator had to materialize, then
slice off a sliver of his own insights into the Heavenly Dao of
Primordial Chaos. Only then could the Dao-fruit survive on its own.
Thus, these fruits contained only an extremely tiny amount of chaos
power. A tribulation storm was sweeping the Three Realms. Although
the major powers of the Seamless Gate might be willing to sever a
portion of their insights into primordial chaos for the sake of
increasing their side’s karmic luck, they would only be willing to
part with a very, very tiny amount of it. If they severed just a
little bit, given enough time they would be able to train back to the
same level. But if they severed too many of their insights…it would
be incredibly hard to regain them in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tiny sliver of chaos
power was already more than enough to weaken the tribulation clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” A cold light
flashed through the Xia Emperor’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribulation cloud
in the skies suddenly transformed into a rainbow of light that shot
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray gas crackled
as it blocked part of the energy. It was just the manifestation of a
tiny amount of chaos power; although it was qualitatively on a
superior level, its power was depleted in the blink of an eye. The
rainbow of light, originally more than three hundred meters thick,
had been whittled down until it was nearly thirty meters thick. It
now only possessed a tenth of its former power, but it moved
lightning fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the White-Faced
Flood Dragons that was battling against the Heaven Punishers suddenly
let out a roar of terror and rage as it raised up its claws to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainbow of light
pierced straight through it, punching a hole in its chest. Quite a
few Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals inside the Terrorbeast
were slain, and the Terrorbeast itself was instantly destroyed. The
Immortals inside were utterly terrified, and they immediately sought
to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unity Heaven
Punisher that was closest to it naturally moved to massacre the
survivors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant True
Immortal Whitepole, however, just watched this happen coldly. All of
this was within the realm of his expectations. For hundreds of
Celestial Immortals to die as a result of the activation of the Grand
Xia’s Worldguard Formation was an excellent bargain. If it hadn’t
been for the Dao-fruit of primodial chaos, he himself probably
would’ve perished from the attack! The power of that formation was
simply far too frightening; it contained power that was close to that
of a Daofather’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, now that
you’ve used even the Worldguard Formation, I imagine you only have
the Raindragon Guard left.” True Immortal Whitepole sent a mental
laugh to the Xia Emperor. “You are guaranteed to lose this fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can all come out
now!” True Immortal Whitepole suddenly let out a loud roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, four towering
figures appeared out of nowhere. Four additional White-Faced Flood
Dragons, their auras soaring into the skies! These four White-Faced
Flood Dragons appeared uncontrollably savage and utterly ferocious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four more?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four more
White-Faced Flood Dragons?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia’s
forces felt their hearts sink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single White-Faced
Flood Dragon represented a thousand Celestial Immortals and a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals. This meant the Seamless Gate had just sent
out four thousand more Celestial Immortals! And it was hard to say
how strong these Terrorbeasts were; perhaps some of them were
comparable to Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon in power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate, you
honor me with your caution.” The Xia Emperor let out a cold laugh.
“Since you wish for the Seamless Gate to come out…then I’ll
grant you your wish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, an
incomparably massive divine dragon appeared in midair. This divine
dragon was rather special. Compared to ordinary divine dragons, it
differed in that it had a pair of enormous wings. This was the
appearance of the legendary Godbeast, the ‘Raindragon’. Daofather
Raindragon was a Godbeast, born with tremendous power. After
experiencing that great war of the Primordial Era, he had ended up
becoming a True God and Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAAAAR!” The
enormous Raindragon instantly charged downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, come!” One
of the White-Faced Flood Dragons let out a frenzied roar as it moved
to engage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon began to
battle against that White-Faced Flood Dragon. Although the Raindragon
held the slight advantage, the White-Faced Flood Dragon was still
more than enough to tie it down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? That
White-Faced Flood Dragon is actually that powerful? It has to be that
an Empyrean God or True Immortal is commanding it.” Ji Ning and the
others felt their hearts turn cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their Raindragon army
was only comparable to a single one of those extra-powerful
White-Faced Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
three…would one of them also be that strong? If that was the case,
they would be in huge trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor coldly
watched as this all occurred. He knew very well that this battle
against the Seamless Gate would be a hard one, because the Seamless
Gate’s intelligence network was simply far too powerful. They knew
all the forces the Xia Emperor had, but he knew nothing about the
Seamless Gate’s forces. He had already revealed all of the power he
had available…but from the looks of it, he was still at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, your defeat
is guaranteed. The Grand Xia shall now be the Grand Xia of me,
Whitepole. Wait…it won’t even be called the Grand Xia any longer.
It’s name should be changed to the Whitepole major world.” True
Immortal Whitepole was filled with an imposing aura, and he had an
incomparably arrogant demeanor to him.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man with long

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Fiendgod army

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the three

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and

face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, our major worlds were all defeated…can
it be that your Grand Xia is going to be defeated as well?” A burly
Empyrean God who had the head of a bear spoke out anxiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our side has lost
some Fiendgods, true, but Empyrean God Coldsavage is still alive, at
least.” The Xia Emperor said coldly, “Our losses aren’t that
severe, and the Seamless Gate has lost eight of their Bloodcloud
golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, no need to be reluctant to admit to the
truth,” the nearby Sword Immortal Evergreen said calmly. “By now,
I imagine you must be able to see that the Seamless Gate has clearly
seized the upper hand. As this battle continues, your side will
suffer even heavier losses! Although the Seamless Gate has lost eight
Bloodcloud golems, the eight of them caused you to lose a Heaven
Punisher and a Fiendgod army. The strong will grow stronger, while
the weak will grow weaker; the distance in power between you and the
Seamless Gate will continue to grow, until the end comes where your
Grand Xia is unable to keep fighting and completely collapses!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s words were unpleasant to hear, but he spoke the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
of the Seamless Gate had been tying down the Fiendgod army led by
Empyrean God Coldsavage, and so when the new White-Faced Flood
Dragons arrived, Whitepole had immediately ordered them to assault
Coldsavage’s Fiendgod army. An entire host of Bloodcloud golems had
thrown themselves into the fray as well. They had focused all of
their extra power on that single Fiendgod army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later…after suffering the loss of four Bloodcloud golems, making
for a total of eight losses in this battle, the Seamless Gate
succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing the Xia
Emperor had been able to do was to take out a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, a red gourd, and draw all of the fleeing Fiendgods
into his gourd. However, there were still many Fiendgods who ended up
being massacred by the Bloodcloud golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I going to lose?”
The Xia Emperor sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the only
idea he had was to ask his master, Crimsonbright, for help. He could
also ask for Daofather Raindragon or the Primordial Imperial Clan to
intercede.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the entirety
of the Three Realms was in quite an ugly state. Would the Daofathers
be willing to intercede and send out their own forces? The Xia
Emperor didn’t feel certain of the answer. Daofather Crimsonbright
and Daofather Raindragon had to know of his needed, but whether or
not they would help out…that was their decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Master, my big
brother, and the Primordial Imperial Clan all refuse to intervene,
then this war will have been lost.” The Xia Emperor was unwilling
to accept this outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world which
he had established. It was the foundation he had built after he had
set up his Xiamang clan. Was he now going to be kicked out, like
sorry-looking mutt being beaten off by a stick?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang still has a very important military force
on his side.” A muscular, golden-eyed man dressed in dragon robes
looked towards the midair mirror of light, pondering to himself. “The
most powerful Heaven Punisher, the one Ji Ning leads. All by himself,
he can deal with two White-Faced Flood Dragons at the same time.
However, he’s been forcibly restrained by True Immortal Crimsonjoy.
Senior apprentice-brother Xiamang, those black chains trapping Ji
Ning…is there no way to break them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way.”
The Xia Emperor shook his head, resigned. “Both sides are battling
all out right now; the amount of help we can provide Ji Ning is
limited. Unless we can send out an overwhelming amount of power,
there’s no way we can break through those black chains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What spell is that?
How can it be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, those black
chains…I’ve never even seen such a spell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nor have I.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They seem like the
black chains that are anchoring the Seamless City in the air, but I
always thought that those were just part of that war-city. I didn’t
expect that there was a similar sort of spell as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals present had been gathered here from the dozens of
major worlds commanded by Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They collectively
possessed tremendous experience, but none of them had ever seen this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor just
closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to
take another look. His true body was within the field of battle; he
knew exactly what was going on. The situation was turning
increasingly grim. The enemy was strong, while his side was slightly
weaker…which meant that the enemy would reap further and further
rewards, causing the disparity in power to grow until one side
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…big
brother…what are you thinking, right now?” The Xia Emperor
groaned mentally to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, this Ji Ning…is he the one you wanted
me to take on as an apprentice, all those years ago?” Sword
Immortal Evergreen suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor gave
him a glance. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I completely forgot
about that.” Sword Immortal Evergreen laughed, “I just
remembered…I heard that this Ji Ning took on a Daofather as his
master. As the disciple of a Daofather…although he’s merely a
Celestial Immortal and a bit weak, he’s still been an extremely
useful general under your command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He might be a
Celestial Immortal, but he’s not weak.” The Xia Emperor shook his
head. “He’s trained for a very short period of time, after all;
his potential is truly extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Potential?” Sword
Immortal Evergreen said calmly, “There are many in the Three Realms
with tremendous potential who have nonetheless been trapped at the
Celestial Immortal stage for countless years. It’s not so easy to
become an Empyrean God or a True Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
face sank. This junior apprentice-brother of his, Sword Immortal
Evergreen…if one wanted to put it nicely, he was a figure who
transcended worldly concerns, but if one wanted to put it bluntly, he
was incredibly selfish! He didn’t care about the feelings of his
fellow disciples at all; he said what he wanted to say, not caring
about their face at all. In a normal situation, everyone was
magnanimous about it, but this was during a time of war, and the Xia
Emperor’s Grand Xia was about to be destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Evergreen’s
words were true…why did he have to insist on saying such depressing
things? Didn’t he know that the Xia Emperor had a belly full of
fire right now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The Xia
Emperor said calmly, “Then junior apprentice-brother Evergreen,
when you were merely a hundred years old, had you already become a
Celestial Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s face instantly changed, but he then smirked. “What’s
the point of putting up a tough verbal façade? Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, it’s time to face reality.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
currently in a terrible mood. He couldn’t be bothered to reply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor felt
miserable in his heart. “Is it really finished?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daofather
Crimsonbright led his Empyrean Gods and True Immortals in watching
the battle from outside the Three Realms, a massive, black-robed
figure was also silently watching from a completely different
location. The Godking was paying very close attention to this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are going to
win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking gently
tapped on his armrest with his left hand. A mirror of mist was in
front of him, revealing the battle in its entirety.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, neither
the Godking nor Daofather Crimsonbright could see inside the body of
Ning’s Heaven Punisher. None of them could see the change in Ji
Ning, Immortal Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Grand Xia. Whitepole Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The savage battle had
been kicked in overdrive as both sides assaulted each other with
abandon. The Seamless Gate’s side was especially eager, while the
Grand Xia’s side clearly seemed a bit dispirited. Everyone could
tell that from the moment that the Fiendgod army led by Empyrean God
Coldsavage was destroyed, the difference in power between the two
sides had grown. The Grand Xia was almost unable to hold on any
longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break!
Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, trapped by those
black chains, felt a frantic feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart was filled
with rage as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why couldn’t he break
these damned chains?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His brothers and
sisters were fighting for their lives. Ning truly was anxious to join
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite his
anxiousness, he was still able to maintain complete control over
himself. His icy calmness and his frantic impatience co-existed
without any conflicts at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning’s
heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…he was
overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could now completely
sense that vast, boundless Grand Dao, the Dao of the Sword. All of
the mysteries of the Dao of the Sword were now within Ning’s heart.
It was different from the past; when Ning was attuning to the Dao,
enormous ripples would manifest. Now, the Dao of the Sword was like
an obedient little child, not resisting or hiding anything from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Ning
had completely mastered and was in complete control of it. Naturally,
he wouldn’t release even the slightest of Dao-ripples to the
outside world unless he chose to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this…is the Dao
of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the only thing I
lacked was a surge of true Sword Immortal ki?” After breaking
through the final bottleneck, Ning instantly understood where his
problem had lain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when one
reached a bottleneck in mastering a Grand Dao, one’s insights into
that Grand Dao were almost complete and perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing that was
lacking was the final merging and fusing of all those insights, to
blend them all together into one thing…the entire Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of fusion
required an insight that was extremely difficult to comprehend.
However, Ning had a very pure sword-heart, and had even mastered a
strand of swordforce. In addition, he had once had a chance to
personally sense the entire Grand Dao of the Sword, thanks to the
[Thousand Year Dream]. Thus, the only thing Ning lacked was that
final surge of ki, the Sword Immortal ki which every single peerless
Sword Immortal possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Sword
Immortal had their own special qualities to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin was
transcendent and non-interventional.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen was supremely self-centered, viewing everything through the
cold lens of pragmatism. He didn’t deign to cloak his words in
pleasantries when dealing with people of the same level. He knew that
his words were unpleasant to hear, but he didn’t care. Perhaps he
might be respectful when in the presence of a Daofather, but he
couldn’t be bothered to do so for other Empyrean Gods and true
Immortals. He knew very well the thing which mattered the most to him
was his own strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, sword in hand,
chopped through all thistles and thorns that sought to bar his path
as he walked towards the true peak of power. Although he knew
everything, simply put, Ning was missing that final surge of ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning had been
tempered and trained through years of battles. In fact, black chains
were surrounding and assaulting him right now, giving him tremendous
pressure. As a result…the pressure caused a rebound effect,
allowing Ning to seize the opportunity to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon making the
breakthrough…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look in Ning’s
eyes changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his eyes
looked similar to how they did in the past, deep within them one
could see a sword-intent that was absolutely harrowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the Sword
is now complete!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for manifesting
the five types of ki within my chest…I’ve always been able to do
that,” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What were the five
types of ki? Metal, wood, water, fire, earth; the Five Elements! The
most important part of a Celestial Immortal becoming a Pure Yang True
Immortal lay in the mastery of a Grand Dao. A secondary component was
in separately mastering five ordinary Daos of the Five Elements.
These Daos of the Five Elements could allow one to link together with
the infrastructure of Heaven and Earth, because the Three Realms were
themselves formed from the Five Elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When manifesting the
five types of ki within the body, one would receive a resonance with
the essential Five Elements of the universe itself. After the Jindan
absorbed an enormous amount of elemental energy, it would then evolve
and transform into a Pure Yang Jindan. Only then would it possess
Pure Yang power, allowing one to become a true Pure Yang True
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re in a fight
right now. I don’t have the time to slowly absorb elemental
energy.” Ning immediately pulled out an enormous amount of Pure
Yang Immortal pills, throwing all of them into his mouth. Right now,
his Jindan needed to absorb a nigh-infinite amount of elemental
energy, and so there was no worry at all about an accidental
self-detonation due to excess power.
</P>

Chapter 23 - The Power Of A Pure Yang True Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elemental energy
contained with Pure Yang Immortal pills was of incredible purity. It
instantly transformed into a tidalwave of elemental energy within Ji
Ning’s Jindan region. The energy of each pill was completely
released, and the entire Jindan drank it all up thirstily, as though
it was starving for energy. It was like a riverbed that was so dry,
the ground had cracked; even if a torrent of rain was to fall onto
it, the riverbed would be able to easily absorb it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the rate at
which the Immortal pills released energy couldn’t even catch up to
the rate at which the Jindan was absorbing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s chest,
five types of semi-transparent ki began to manifest and flow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five streams of
ki came from the insights Ning had in the five Daos of the Five
Elements. They now all gathered together, connecting Ning to the
essence of Heaven and Earth itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had trained for
many years. Aside from the Dao of the Sword, his accomplishments in
the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop were the most advanced. He had
mastered more than half of it by now. As for ordinary water-related
Daos, he had long since mastered sixteen different types. In truth,
mastering ordinary Daos was now of very little help to Ning. While
working on his Grand Dao, he would occasionally get a flash of
insight that would allow him to master a particular ordinary Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very skilled
in fire-related Daos as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Metal…Ning was quite
skilled in this as well, thanks to his expertise in the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth…this was the
slowest for Ning to train in, but Ning had still mastered a complete,
ordinary earth-related Dao. Even back when Ning had first arrived at
the Black-White College, he had begun to train in the Lesser Five
Elements sword-art, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.” The
five types of ki within his chest were slowly beginning to link
together and resonate with the essence of the Five Elements within
Heaven and Earth, causing tiny streams of energy to be transmitted
into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These streams of energy
consisted of the essence of the Five Elements. They were all
transmitted straight into Ning’s Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like celestial snow
meeting with infernal flame, an explosive transformation erupted.
Ning’s Jindan began to completely transform, and its quality was
increasing at an incredible rate. The Jindan region within Ning’s
body grew even greater, and the energy that created and maintained
the Jindan grew more and more pure as it began to rise towards the
Pure Yang level. Although an enormous amount of elemental energy was
being used up, Ning had plenty of Immortal pills prepared. Ning had
acquired a large number of Immortal pills from the Xia Emperor, when
he had traded away his Empyrean God golem. Even after mastering the
Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning had a large number
of Immortal pills left over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all of this
took time to describe, in reality it happened tremendously fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After just two breaths
worth of time, Ning’s Jindan had successfully completed its
transformation into an even purer, deeper, and somewhat darker golden
color! This was a darkness that came from density and depth, and the
energy within this Jindan now vastly surpassed the energy contained
within the Jindan of a Celestial Immortal. It caused Ning’s
Celestial Immortal body to instantly be transformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden pellet
Jindan within Ning’s body was now a Pure Yang Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was second only to
the Great Firmament Jindan possessed by Daofathers of the Great
Firmament. The Pure Yang Jindan continued to absorb the remaining
energy from the Immortal pills, causing the power of the Jindan to
grow even heavier and denser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning
immediately used the spell which his master, Subhuti, had taught to
him. He masked his Pure Yang aura, transforming into the aura of a
Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a form of
artifice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In battle…Ning needed
to disguise his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a wonderful
feeling. The feeling of being a Pure Yang True Immortal…it truly is
powerful! Pleasurable!” Ning could sense the might his body
contained as the Pure Yang power flooded his body. “Is this the
feeling which Patriarch Lu and the Xia Emperor have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Lu and the
Xia Emperor were both Pure Yang True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals had
their energy, Pure Yang True Immortals had their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The transformation in
their energy alone represented an enormous increase in power. In
fact, Ning even had the feeling that right now, if he were to attack
by himself without a thousand Celestial Immortals or a hundred
thousand Loose Immortals aiding him, he would still be able to give a
White-Faced Flood Dragon a good fight. In the past? His Primaltwin,
merely a Celestial Immortal, had to rely on the power of the entire
army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Darknorth army…”
Ning immediately activated his Pure Yang energy, beginning to take
control of even more power from the entire Heaven Punisher formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His power grew deeper
and deeper. The power of the entire Heaven Punisher began to
skyrocket. It doubled. Tripled. Quadrupled. Quintuipled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power continued to
increase. Ten times. Twelve times. Eighteen times. Twenty-one times!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the power of
the Heaven Punisher reached a limit, and the increase came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Why is it that I
have the feeling that I’ve almost brought out all the power this
Heaven Punisher has to offer?” Ning had a foundation of Pure Yang
energy, and had a soul heartforce technique supporting him; as a
result, he was in control of almost 80% of the total maximum
theoretical power of a Heaven Punisher! Ning could vaguely sense that
he was very close to a hard limit in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that not even the other Empyrean Gods or True Immortals were able to
unleash this much power from a single Heaven Punisher! Not Empyrean
God Venomsong, for example, nor the other Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
some Empyrean Gods and True Immortals in the Three Realms who had
gained insight into heartforce, the overall ratio was low; it could
be said that less than one in ten practiced heartforce! For example,
in this current battle within the Grand Xia, aside from Ning, there
were two others who had gained a basic level of expertise into
heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was the Xia
Emperor, who had reached the second stage in heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other was
Gatemaster Azurefox, who had also reached the second stage in
heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most important
thing was, even someone who had powerful heartforce had to come up
with a way to apply it to the soul as well. Ning was incredibly
talented in this regard; previously, all by himself, he had come up
with a way to apply it to his sword-fingers, then had come up with a
way to apply it to actual Immortal swords. After being transmitted
the [Heart Sutra] by Old Man Yuan, he had slowly begun to reach
towards a way to apply heartforce to the soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Pure Yang True
Immortal whose heartforce had reached the peak of the third stage,
and who had a basic level of expertise in soul heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
Ning was able to command eighty percent of the maximum power of the
Heaven Punisher?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be said that
Ning was now far, far superior to anyone else on either side in terms
of controlling a Heaven Punisher. Even when he was a Celestial
Immortal, Ning was capable of giving Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood
Dragon a good fight; he was just slightly weaker than it, that was
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning’s Heaven Punisher brandished the Ananda World-Swords, chopping
down against the black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still used the same
amount of power he had in the past, before making his breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning now had a
feeling…that if he was to unleash his full power, the black chains
would be completely unable to stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning swept
the field of battle with his gaze. “The current situation is
extremely unfavorable towards the Grand Xia. From the looks of
things, if no one else arrives to help out, the only result will be a
defeated retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because my
breakthrough was within the Heaven Punisher’s body, most likely no
one knows of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant True Immortal Crimsonjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy had been maintaining this spell the entire time. This used
up a shocking amount of energy, and so he had been constantly using
Immortal pills to replenish it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ideally, I should
kill True Immortal Crimsonjoy in a single blow,” Ning secretly
calculated to himself. “Even though I should currently be the most
powerful figure on this battlefield, it’s still quite hard to
actually kill a Pure Yang True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme powers on
this field of battle were the Fiendgod armies, Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon, and the Raindragon army. Of course, the Xia
Emperor and True Immortal Whitepole were on this level of power as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Xia Emperor
and True Immortal Whitepole were very powerful in and of themselves.
As for Empyrean God Coldsavage, Empyrean God Kindwater, Empyrean God
Venomsong, and the others, they all had to rely on armies in order to
release this level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, by himself, was
naturally no match for the Xia Emperor or True Immortal Whitepole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had the
Darknorth army, heartforce, and a soul heartforce technique. This
made his Heaven Punisher the most powerful force present, vastly
stronger than Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, not a
single Empyrean God or True Immortal has perished. Not even the Xia
Emperor’s usage of the Grand Xia’s Worldguard Formation was
enough to kill one of them.” Ning knew very well that killing one
would be very hard, but he had to give it a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this battlefield,
the Xia Emperor and True Immortal Whitepole were the field marshals
for their respective armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it all over?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor stared
at the field of battle. Daofather Raindragon, Daofather
Crimsonbright, and the Primordial Imperial Clan…none of them had
sent reinforcements. The Xia Emperor felt powerless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now understood…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That his master and the
others probably had other concerns, precluding them from reinforcing
him. The Xia Emperor, however, still found it hard to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat,” the Xia
Emperor ordered in a hoarse, unwilling shout, one which rang out by
the ears of everyone on his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous Eight
Dragons Cloudcity began to appear as well, pressing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and retreat
into the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,” the Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all looked towards
the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
however, just shook his head. He didn’t want to admit it, but he
could tell that their defeat was guaranteed! There was no way for
them to change the situation! If this continued, the Grand Xia’s
forces would probably be completely destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it…forget
it. If I lose, I lose. There’s never been such a thing as an
eternal empire within this universe. Even my Primordial Imperial
Clan…its current status cannot compare to its status during the
Primordial Era.” The Xia Emperor sighed mentally, completely giving
up. He would no longer fight. It was time to prepare to flee. If they
fled, they would at least stay alive. If they continued to fight
head-on, death would be the result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I, Xiamang, have done
all I can…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, I have
nothing more to give, now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t forget he
had arrived within this world with high spirits, roaming across it
and nurturing it, defeating all challengers until he finally unified
the entire Grand Xia. He felt deep attachments towards this world of
his, but alas…it was now time to leave. This world would now belong
to the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…don’t let
them just escape like that. Kill them all!” True Immortal Whitepole
roared with laughter. He felt utter excitement, right now, because he
could sense that the Xia Emperor no longer had any plans to fight
back and was most likely going to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This world’s name was
going to be changed to the Whitepole major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He…would be its
master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Xiamang wishes to
flee, he needs to first consider whether or not I, Whitepole, shall
permit it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
True Immortal Whitepole’s eyes were filled with a shocking desire
to kill, and the morale of the Seamless Gate’s forces swelled up to
a crescendo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This explosion came
from a part of the battlefield which had been fairly calm and silent
this entire time. It was the place where Ning’s Heaven Punisher had
been trapped. Although the Xia Emperor wanted to rescue him, it was
currently hard for them to even save themselves; how were they
supposed to send out even more forces to rescue Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Xia
Emperor, True Immortal Whitepole, and the others all turned their
heads to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired, red-eyed elder just stood there in a daze. Around him,
snow-colored lotus flowers were flying about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elder touched his
chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pure Yang Jindan
within his body…had been shattered in an instant, under a sudden,
sinister assassination strike by Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-eyed elder
opened his mouth, wanting to say something…but before he could make
a single sound, he transformed into flying dust. He had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After so many years of
battling to claim the Grand Xia…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A True Immortal had
finally died! True Immortal Crimsonjoy had perished! The killer was a
Heaven Punisher…Ji Ning’s!

Chapter 24 - Withdrawing The Troops
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia and the
Seamless Gate; both forces on that battlefield were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia had
already begun a retreat, while the Seamless Gate was in hot, eager
pursuit, planning on carving a few extra pieces of flesh from the Xia
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal
Crimsonjoy died?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An exalted, powerful
Pure Yang True Immortal…had actually died?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did Ji Ning DO
that? He…wasn’t he trapped? Even if he managed to charge out, how
could he have killed True Immortal Crimsonjoy in an instant?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, I seemed
to see snow-white lotus petals floating around True Immortal
Crimsonjoy’s body. Could his death be connected to the Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, the ‘Nineleaf Snowlotus’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
forces were completely stunned. They simply couldn’t believe this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were clearly on
the verge of victory…how did the hell did this suddenly happen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only person on the
battlefield who wasn’t stunned was Ning himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief. Although he had an absolute advantage in power
thanks to his Heaven Punisher, he hadn’t been certain that he would
be able to kill True Immortal Crimsonjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had first
activated his Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the Nineleaf Snowlotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nineleaf Snowlotus
was best-suited for trapping and binding foes. In the past, Ning was
a mere Celestial Immortal; even when he used the power of the Heaven
Punisher to activate the Nineleaf Snowlotus, it wouldn’t be
excessively powerful. After becoming a Pure Yang True Immortal,
however, and after merging his Pure Yang energy with the power of his
Heaven Punisher, then using it all to activate the Nineleaf
Snowlotus…the power of the countless snowlotuses he could create
was truly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had instantly
covered the completely unprepared True Immortal Crimsonjoy with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he used the
snow-white lotus petals to surround True Immortal Crimsonjoy, Ning
unleashed his full power, instantly shattering apart the entangling
black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Upon
being trapped by the snowlotuses, and upon sensing his spell being
destroyed, True Immortal Crimsonjoy immediately knew that something
bad was happening. A sudden variable had to have been introduced into
the battle, but he couldn’t see what was going on beyond the
barrier of snowlotuses, nor could he Greater Teleport. He didn’t
dare hide himself within an Immortal estate either; if he did, the
enemy would be able to immediately capture it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the only thing he
could do at the time…was to use his own Pure Yang treasures to
protect himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold, insidious sword
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After shattering the
black chains, Ning immediately sent out a silent, soundless
sword-strike. This was an assassination sword-art which Ning had
learned back at Mount Innerheart. He had learned far too many
sword-arts at Mount Innerheart, including several that had been
devised by Daofathers of the Great Firmament. Usually, it was rare
for Ning to use any of those sword-arts, as those were sword-arts
that others had developed; although they were very powerful in Ning’s
hands, there was no way he could truly reach a level of absolute
perfection in them. Ning, however, had never tried to create his own
assassination sword-arts. Given the inconceivable power of the Heaven
Punisher he led, this sword-art was already powerful enough. And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snow-white lotus
petals instantly split apart, allowing Ning’s sword to hack
directly against True Immortal Crimsonjoy’s protective magic
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because True Immortal
Crimsonjoy had been trapped by the snow-white lotus flowers, his
protective treasure’s defensive field was very, very close to his
body. This assassination sword-art Ning employed was a type of
vibration-based sword-art. When he chopped down, a very strange yet
incredibly powerful form of energy was transformed into a vibration
that not even Pure Yang magic treasures could block. The vibration
was sent straight into True Immortal Crimsonjoy’s body…and it
instantly shattered apart his Pure Yang Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
imagine how powerful Ning’s sword-attack had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, someone like
True Immortal Crimsonjoy would’ve never dared to fight Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon, one of the Fiendgod armies, or the
Raindragon army head-on. Ning was much more powerful than any of the
three; how could Crimsonjoy possibly resist it? And in truth, Ning
was lucky to possess the Nineleaf Snowlotus. If it wasn’t for the
Snowlotus binding Crimsonjoy, when Ning charged over Crimsonjoy
would’ve fled right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven knew that Ning had used the Nineleaf Snowlotus, a
treasure which had previously belonged to Blackheaven himself, to cut
off the escape path for True Immortal Crimsonjoy, who Blackheaven had
asked to help out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really would be hard
to describe how Celestial Immortal Blackheaven would feel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize the momentum.
Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While he celebrated his
victory, Ning didn’t hesitate in the slightest as he immediately
charged straight towards the closest enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
White-Faced Flood Dragons of the Seamless gate in that location, as
well as a group of Empyrean God golems. They had been assaulting the
five Heaven Punishers of the Grand Xia, who per the Xia Emperor’s
orders were retreating while supporting each other defensively. At
this moment, however, everyone had come to a halt. They were all
stunned, and the forces of the Grand Xia felt wild joy in their
hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, go help out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go help them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Seamless Gate’s
side, True Immortal Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox were the first
to come back to their senses. They didn’t have any time to be
astonished at True Immortal Crimsonjoy’s death; they immediately
began to give orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
first changed the target of his spell to focus on Ning. The icy Solar
Star that was hovering in the skies behind him began to shoot rays of
frozen light towards Ning’s charging Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cold light flashed in
an unending stream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
Heaven Punisher was bounding barefoot across the land. After having
seen True Immortal Whitepole use this spell before, Ning felt no fear
at all. He swung out an Ananda World-Sword, his sword-light flowing
like water. Ever since Ning was young, he had been particularly adept
at using sword-arts to defend. The curtain-like flow of watery
sword-light was able to completely block all of the frozen lances of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tremendous power
within Ning’s words were able to endure all of the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t stop him.”
True Immortal Whitepole’s face changed. “Quick! Junior
apprentice-sister Azurefox, go help out. The Heaven Punisher which Ji
Ning is in command of is far too powerful. I was able to stop even a
Fiendgod army, but I can’t stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Azurefox
was anxious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
fairly distant from Ning. There was no time to charge in and attack
him up close; their only options were to use spells, magic treasures,
and other long-distance options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine bushy fox-tails
lashed through the air, seeming to blot out and darken the skies
themselves as they swept towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just f*ck off.”
Ning’s Heaven Punisher continued to bound forward, two swords in
his hands. Previously, he had used just a single sword to block True
Immortal Whitepole. Now, he used the other sword as well. Boom! Boom!
Boom! When his sword struck out, it was as though the heavens had
suddenly turned clear and bright again. The nine furry tails were
blasted apart, leaving just a small portion of the tails undamaged.
Quickly, however, the nine tails once more grew outwards and
regenerated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t slow down
at all…and he was far too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod armies,
the Heaven Punishers, the White-Faced Flood Dragons, the Raindragon
army…none of them were comparable to Ning’s Heaven Punisher in
terms of speed! In fact, even the Bloodcloud golems were just barely
on par with Ning’s speed right now. From this, one could tell how
terrifyingly fast Ning truly was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, go save
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop that Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
frantically issued the orders. Ji Ning’s sudden, explosive increase
in power was absolutely capable of changing the outcome of this
entire battle. If they weren’t able to slow him down and allowed
him to just charge forward as he currently was…no army, Empyrean
God, or True Immortal was capable of fighting against Ji Ning’s
Heaven Punisher without assistance. The forces of the Seamless Gate
would most likely be destroyed by Ning, one at a time…resulting in
a defeat for this entire battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, they had to focus
all of their efforts on stopping him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light struck out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three White-Faced
Flood Dragons were fleeing now, with the five Heaven Punishers in hot
pursuit, as well as Ning’s Heaven Punisher. As Ning’s sword-light
flew out…the White-Faced Flood Dragon he targeted only had a chance
to let out a furious, unwilling roar of defeat. Slash! Ning’s
longsword chopped straight through the neck of the White-Faced Flood
Dragon, sending the head flying. The body of the dragon immediately
broke apart, revealing the Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals
inside of it, who immediately began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! KILL!”
Celestial Immortal Unity, Celestial Immortal Whacko, and the others
all led their Heaven Punishers in a massacre of the survivors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another massive
explosion could be heard. A tremendously powerful White-Faced Flood
Dragon had managed to force its way in front of Ji Ning. This was
Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon, which had been nearest to
Ning. Venomsong struck out with the sharp, fierce claws of his
dragon, while Ning once more swept out with the Ananda World-Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
these two massive Fiendgod-manifestations had fought head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon was actually knocked off its two scaly legs
by the force of the collision and sent flying backwards. This result
caused a look of utter shock to appear on the face of Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon! He…he was actually… this much weaker
than Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” True
Immortal Whitepole’s face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, upon seeing
Ning’s might, he had made a rough estimate of Ning’s power and
had expected Ning’s Heaven Punisher to be stronger than Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon. But to actually knock Venomsong’s
White-Faced Flood Dragon flying like that…this was beyond his
expectations. The difference in power was enormous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slow him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no time to be
astonished. True Immortal Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox both
focused their spells against Ning, and both their spells were
extraordinarily powerful. Ning had to use at least one sword at all
times to defend against them. With two of them joining forces against
him…Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon had more than enough
time to recover from that blow, then once more charge forward to
engage Ning in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, True Immortal
Whitepole, Gatemaster Azurefox, and Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood
Dragon all joined forces to just barely stalemate and tie down Ji
Ning. Just barely! Ning was still able to charge forward; he was just
somewhat slowed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat!” True
Immortal Whitepole had an ugly look on his face as he mentally roared
the order to his forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They couldn’t allow
this fight to continue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already lost
True Immortal Crimsonjoy and a White-Faced Flood Dragon. Ji Ning, all
by himself, was able to tie down Whitepole, Azurefox, and Venomsong.
The Seamless Gate no longer had any advantages whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
forces began to retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this, the
Seamless Gate had a significant tactical. After True Immortal
Whitepole, Gatemaster Azurefox, and Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood
Dragon had joined forces to tie down Ji Ning, their forces were no
longer in significant danger, and so they were able to retreat in a
very stable, orderly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, this sudden,
unexpected ‘final battle’ came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw our
troops.” The Xia Emperor’s voice rang out as well, once more
filled with vigor and willpower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war for the Grand
Xia…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t lost it
yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor stared
at the distant, awe-inspiring, half-nude Heaven Punisher commanded by
Ji Ning. In his heart, he celebrated joyfully, and he even felt a
hint of gratitude towards Ji Ning. Ji NIng truly had been the fulcrum
upon which the results of this battle had turned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beyond the Three
Realms. The seat of awakening for Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Daofather
Crimsonbright himself, a whole host of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals were watching the battle scenes depicted within that mirror
of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He just exploded
with power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Crimsonjoy just died. He actually died, just like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, he’s still
charging forward. He’s incredibly ferocious; he’s just smashing
straight through them. The Seamless Gate is panicking now. True
Immortal Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox have both used their
spells, but they can’t stop him. They can’t stop him at all! The
White-Faced Flood Dragons have started to flee. It’s useless! They
are too slow. Ji Ning just attacked with his sword…ahaha! One of
them died! Ugh, Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon just
arrived…this is going to be a bit troubleso-…he was just sent
flying?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood had been
rather depressed, but now all of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
felt their energy levels rising.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of their homelands
and major worlds had already been conquered, after all. Even the ones
that weren’t conquered yet felt grief upon seeing the Grand Xia
fall into such dire straits. If even the Grand Xia had fallen…how
could they hope to survive? Most likely, only extremely selfish
individuals like Sword Immortal Evergreen, who didn’t have any
major worlds or territories to worry about, would be completely
unconcerned with the results of this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can Ji Ning be
this powerful? Can it be that he’s become a Pure Yang True
Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His aura is simply…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was sighing in
amazement. Who wouldn’t hope for a brutal, dominating figure like
Ning to appear on their side during a battle?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
clone just stood there, smiling. Smiling with great happiness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He glanced sideways at
the nearby Sword Immortal Evergreen, who had a rather unpleasant look
on his face. Evergreen had said quite a few things just now, after
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, junior
apprentice-brother Evergreen, you weren’t able to take Ji Ning on
as your disciple all those years ago. Otherwise…you really would’ve
delayed his progress,” the Xia Emperor sighed ‘emotionally’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” Sword
Immortal Evergreen’s face sank. He immediately began a retort; he
wasn’t the sort to easily admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly, Daofather
Crimsonbright, seated above all of them on his throne, let out a
loud, clear laugh. “This Ji Ning…good, very good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The words which Sword
Immortal Evergreen was just about to spew out became stuck in his
throat. He wasn’t able to say a single thing.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals below Daofather Crimsonbright looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Years ago, I once
had the chance to take on this Ji Ning as my disciple, but of the
three choices that were made available to me, I choose Little
Woodpass.” Daofather Crimsonbright smiled, seeming to be in an
excellent mood. “I felt certain that Little Woodpass would have
more potential than Ji Ning, but it seems that my vision has grown
blurry with age.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To praise Ji Ning was
one thing; after all, he had indeed completely changed the situation
in that battle at the Grand Xia. But for the Daofather to say that
his ‘vision has grown blurry with age’ was a bit exaggerated.
What sort of a status did a Daofather have? Even if he truly did wish
to satirize himself a bit, for him to satirize himself for Ji Ning’s
sake was quite bizarre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, it was
that old friend of mine who had superior vision.” Daofather
Crimsonbright pointed towards the air, and yet another mirror of
light appeared out of nowhere. The images of yet another battle
appeared on that mirror, one in which more than a hundred Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were participating in, alongside true
dragons, Fiendgods, phoenixes, and other mythical beasts. The two
sides in the battle were battling with ferocity. Daofather
Crimsonbright said calmly, “The final battle between the Winesun
Realm and the Seamless Gate has reached the crescendo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone below watched
the battle carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Winesun Realm was
the dozens of major worlds and countless minor worlds ruled over by
Daofather Winesun. It was a realm that was not inferior to the
Crimsonbright Realm at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Winesun Realm
has actually sent nearly eighty Empyrean Gods and True Immortals into
battle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look; those eighteen
True Immortals have joined together into a Ninesongs Formation. They
must be close to a Daofather in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are going quite
berserk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the phoenix
lineage has descended.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a great
battle, one which was far more vicious than the one the Grand Xia had
just engaged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Xia Emperor
watched this battle, he suddenly understood everything. Right…as he
was feeling misery for the Celestial Immortals and the Loose
Immortals who had perished under his command, the exalted Daofathers
were watching things on a much higher level. During such a violent
tempest as this one which had swept the Three Realms, the deaths of
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals simply wouldn’t cause too
much of a reaction from the Daofathers. Only the deaths of Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals would arouse the attention of the True Gods
and Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the eyes of the Xia
Emperor, his losses had been unsustainably catastrophic. In the eyes
of the Daofathers, however…the battle in the Grand Xia had resulted
in comparable losses for both the Xia Emperor and the Seamless Gate.
Things had yet to reach a truly dire state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This great storm is
one which has swept the entire Three Realms. In the end, it will
cause many True Gods and Daofathers to perish…and to think, I was
about to give up so easily? It seems that I’ve been living a
comfortable life for far, far too long…just the slightest setback
was enough to make me feel despair and a desire to retreat,” the
Xia Emperor mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out within the Xia Emperor’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
couldn’t help but raise his head to look. The speaker was Daofather
Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The battle for the
Grand Xia has just started,” Daofather Crimsonbright sent mentally.
“The Seamless Gate has only sent a small portion of its forces; the
assault is mainly being led by the Gatemaster Azurefox’s Seamless
Gate. That is why none of us were in a hurry to intervene. If the
Seamless Gate lets it go, then we’ll let it go as well. But if they
are to summon their forces and attack en masse, then we will assist
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
instantly grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, if
you aren’t even able to withstand the limited forces which Azurefox
has brought out from her branch of the Seamless Gate, then you have
no one to blame but yourself,” Daofather Crimsonbright sent
mentally. “You can only blame yourself for not working hard enough,
for not even being strong enough to force Azurefox’s branch to
request reinforcements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
Xia Emperor nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he thought back…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, he, Xiamang,
hadn’t been ruthless enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t been
ruthless enough to his subordinates. He hadn’t been willing to let
any of his Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, or Heaven Punishers to
perish. But in a real life-and-death war, sacrifices sometimes had to
be made. The more you tried to ensure that none of your people died,
the more likely it was that you would fail. The Seamless Gate, for
example; they had essentially sent many of their Bloodcloud golems
into certain death, but the Bloodcloud golems had been very
successful. The deaths of just eight of those golems had resulted in
them slaying a Heaven Punisher and a Fiendgod army. This sort of
mindset, of going all out even at the risk of your own death, could
indeed be astonishingly successful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t been
ruthless enough to himself either. He hadn’t been willing to use up
a large amount of his own Jindan essence in activating the Grand
Xia’s Worldguard Formation a second time, because if he had, his
white-robed Primaltwin wouldn’t have been able to recover for a
very long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
needs to engage on multiple battlefronts, fanning the flames of war
throughout the entire Three Realms,” Daofather Crimsonbright sent
mentally. “Their forces are limited. Although their intelligence
reports provided them with a rough estimate of the power of your
Grand Xia and allow them to make some arrangements, they can’t
waste too much of their power either. If it hadn’t been for the
fact that three thousand Celestial Immortals of the Grand Xia had
been seduced into their service, they actually would’ve been at a
disadvantage in manpower compared to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest level
members of the Seamless Gate have ordered their subordinates to go
all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…need to go all
out as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some Celestial
Immortals may die; even Empyrean Gods and True Immortals may die. So
what? This is a tribulation, a true storm. If we can kill seven or
eight of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate in
exchange for just losing four or five of ours, it would be worth it;
it would be a great victory.” Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice
caused the Xia Emperor to feel rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing a thousand foes
while losing five hundred allies; this would be considered a
tremendous victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the midst of a
storm, you need to be awakened as to how to behave within it. When
the Primordial World was destroyed, you were very weak and so did not
take part in the battle; you have no idea how terrifying these great
storms can be. This is just the beginning…because that old bastard
has yet to fully awaken.” Daofather Crimsonbright sent mentally,
“Once that old bastard truly awakens, this storm will reach its
crescendo. By then, Empyrean Gods and True Immortals will be like
ants, and a large number of True Gods and Daofathers will perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
erred.” The Xia Emperor now completely understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to be ruthless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ruthless to his
subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ruthless to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then could he
survive this storm!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity, there was a joyous celebration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod armies,
Raindragon army, and Heaven Punisher armies were all sent back to
their quarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, it is very rare for me, Floatwater, to admire someone…but
I truly admire what you did this day.” After the Raindragon army
was dissolved, a willowy maiden dressed in black armor came flying
out from it. She was a Pure Yang True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, True Immortal Floatwater,” Ning said. He was still
pretending to be a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for such
courtesy. In fact, in terms of leading and commanding a thousand
Celestial Immortals and all those Loose Immortals, you are actually
superior to me.” True Immortal Floatwater gave Ning a close look.
“To tell the truth…I even suspect that you’ve already become a
Pure Yang True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One delighted voice
after another rang out. It was Unity, Allbeasts, Whacko, Rainsoar,
and Dustfloat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his four
sworn brothers and sworn sister, both joy and grief in his heart. He
felt grief because his sixth brother, Rainbow, had already perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…sixth brother
didn’t have a chance to see it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainbow, he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the six of them
reunited, they quickly turned sorrowful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There will always be
deaths in war.” The black-robed Xia Emperor flew over, a group of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals by his side. It was Empyrean God
Kindwater, Empyrean God Coldsavage, Empyrean God Firecloud, True
Immortal Skyfarmer, and True Immortal Dongyan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
Ning and the rest of the six all hurriedly saluted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, many
Celestial Immortals, Loose Immortals, and even Fiendgods perished.
Rainbow was just one of them,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said.
“This is just the start of this great storm. We should all
understand that even more of us will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
understood this point. Subhuti had spoken to Ning of this as well.
These two great alliances were both seeking to destroy the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…” The
black-robed Xia Emperor looked at Ning, revealing a smile. “Hahaha,
Ji Ning, you truly gave me a wonderful surprise. Haha, I had even
given an order for us to temporarily withdraw…but who would’ve
thought that you would bring me such a wonderful surprise? You even
killed a Pure Yang True Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Temporarily
withdraw’? It most certainly was not! Back then, the Xia Emperor
had wanted to completely flee from the Grand Xia and admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, the
advantage lies not with the Seamless Gate; it lies with us, the Grand
Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor looked
at his allies, his laugh loud and clear. “Right now, the biggest
headache the Seamless Gate has is addressing the question of how to
deal with Ji Ning. True Immortal Whitepole, Gatemaster Azurefox, and
Venomsong’s White-Faced Flood Dragon had to all work together in
order to just slightly slow him down; they aren’t able to
completely tie him down. I imagine that they’d have to send out yet
another Empyrean God or True Immortal in command of a White-Faced
Flood Dragon to accomplish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That would make
things much more relaxed for the rest of us. We can slaughter them.”
The Grand Xia also had the Raindragon army, the two Fiendgod armies,
as well as five Heaven Punishers and multiple Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire atmosphere
within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity became much more relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slaying a Pure Yang
True Immortal was definitely a great success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere here was
very gloomy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonjoy died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were all gathered within the main palace. Everyone,
including True Immortal Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox, had ugly
looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
killed a few Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals of the Grand
Xia, they had also lost many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals;
their losses were actually fairly comparable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had lost one of
their Pure Yang True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven Punisher
under Ji Ning’s command suddenly became incredibly powerful. Just
now, Whitepole, Azurefox, and Venomsong’s Heaven Punisher had to
join forces against him, but he was still able to charge forward. We
no longer have enough power to win this war. If this continues, we’ll
be in danger of actually losing it. As I see it…we need to request
reinforcements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Request
reinforcements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t have
enough strength left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals all spoke out in favor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gatemaster Azurefox,
however, had a dark look on her face. She snapped coldly, “Request
reinforcements…do you think it will be that easy? The Godking has a
hundred Seamless Gates which have been assigned to conquer many major
worlds. Some of them are now permanently stationed on
already-conquered major worlds. Every single Seamless Gate is in
desperate need of additional forces, of more power. Who doesn’t
want reinforcements? But if everyone wants reinforcements…it will
be hard for anyone to actually get it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone fell silent
for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their alliance’s
total military power, compared to the Nuwa Alliance, was still
weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise, they
wouldn’t have had to use all sorts of enticements and underhanded
methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, they had
an absolute advantage in terms of intelligence reports. As the saying
goes, only when you know your enemy and know yourself can you be the
victor in all your battles. In a war, intelligence was tremendously
important. It was thanks to their intelligence reports that the
Seamless Gate had been able to create so many problems for the Nuwa
alliance. In truth, the Seamless Gate’s power was already stretched
very thin. To request reinforcements? It would be difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, the Godking
had taken out a Dao-fruit of primordial chaos for them to deal with
the Grand Xia’s Worldguard Formation, but had not given them any
additional reinforcements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox, things are
different now. Ji Ning is a new variable, a major new variable in
this equation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Report it to
the Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s display of
power had been too great. He had caused the Seamless Gate to sense
that if things were to continue, they would probably lose
disastrously no matter how hard they fought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gatemaster Azurefox
fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
looked towards her as well. Although he had also taken on the Godking
as his master, Azurefox was closer to the Godking than Whitepole was,
and she was the Gatemaster of this Seamless Gate. True Immortal
Whitepole was nothing more than the temporary military commander for
this campaign against the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I’ll report
it to the Godking,” Azurefox said heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Requesting
reinforcements…Azurefox felt very ashamed for being forced to
resort to this.

Chapter 26 - The Godking’s Decision
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single candle had
already been lit. A fragrant smoke was drifting about, filling the
entire room. Azurefox was seated in the lotus position, and she
slowly closed her eyes, gradually entering the realm of slumber and
dreams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox appeared
within the vast world of darkness. At the center of the world of
darkness, a towering figure suddenly appeared atop a towering throne
that was at least thirty thousand meters tall, a figure that was
covered in black robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lost?” The
Godking looked downwards calmly, his voice reverberating within the
entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive me,
Godking.” Azurefox immediately fell to her knees. She said
hurriedly, “We’ve already done everything we can, and everything
unfolded as we expected, but…who would’ve thought that Ji Ning,
who clearly was just a Celestial Immortal, would become the most
powerful force on the side of the Xia Emperor? It is very taxing for
us to withstand just his Heaven Punisher alone. We truly have no
other options…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking just looked
at her silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox knelt there,
not daring to lift up her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was watching the
battle between you and the Grand Xia this entire time,” the Godking
said calmly. “Ji Ning’s rate of improvement truly is quite
fast…but in addition to that, each of you were cowardly and feared
for your lives. Whitepole, in particular…has truly disappointed me!
I bestowed a Dao-fruit of primordial chaos upon him, but he still
wasn’t able to gain victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive us,
Godking,” Azurefox said nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking strummed
his throne’s armrest with his hand, having fallen silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tap. Tap. Tap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only sound in the
entire world was the sound of him tapping against his armrest, and it
echoed nonstop within the darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox didn’t dare
to make a sound. She knew that the Godking was pondering…was
deciding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To reinforce them? Or
to not reinforce them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire situation
had been reversed, and they had gained a major victory. The Xia
Emperor had just summoned his Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and
Celestial Immortal commanders to the main hall to engage in a
discussion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the military
camp of the Darknorth army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That really felt
excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I felt so stifled
for so long, trapped by those black chains. Immortal Darknorth was
truly formidable; he actually led us to break those chains apart and
kill that so-called ‘True Immortal Crimsonjoy’. We even killed
that White-Faced Flood Dragon and sent the Seamless Gate scurrying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s simply
incredible. Not even the Heaven Punishers controlled by an Empyrean
God or a True Immortal can be this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
and the countless Loose Immortals within the camp all chatted
excitedly amongst themselves. The amount of power their Heaven
Punisher had suddenly wielded in the end was incredibly stimulating
to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainbowflame Fairy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing Yu Wei pass
by, all of them were very respectful. They all knew that Yu Wei and
Ji Ning were Dao-companions, and the bulge in Yu Wei’s belly was
already quite noticeable. Everyone could tell that she was pregnant.
The child within Yu Wei’s belly most likely had to be the child of
their commander, Immortal Darknorth; naturally, these Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals were extremely careful and respectful
of Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei smiled and
nodded towards them, replying with a few pleasantries before turning
and entering her residence to prepare some dishes for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning entered the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was carrying a
platter of food outside as he entered. Smiling, she said, “I heard
that you achieved a grand victory today. You even killed a True
Immortal, a True Immortal Crimsonjoy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve heard
already?” Ning sat down, surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the camp
is talking about it. How could I not know?” Yu Wei poured some
Immortal wine for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled.
“Right. I was fairly lucky. Without planning on it, I ended up
killing True Immortal Crimsonjoy in one blow. But alas…I was just a
step too slow. If I made my breakthrough slightly earlier, our side
probably would’ve lost even fewer forces.” When Ning thought of
his sixth brother, Celestial Immortal Rainbow, he couldn’t help but
feel a bit of misery. His Dao-heart, however, allowed him to quickly
smooth over and settle down his emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You made a
breakthrough?” Yu Wei said, surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded lightly, then said, “I’ve made a breakthrough in my soul
heartforce technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Subhuti,
had instructed him long ago that he was not to casually inform others
of his breakthrough to the Pure Yang True Immortal level. He was not
to tell Yu Wei or Uncle White, who he held complete faith in, about
it! If he told a single person, the Seamless Gate would have a chance
to find out about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve finally
made a breakthrough in your soul heartforce technique?” Yu Wei said
joyfully, “Wonderful. A breakthrough in soul heartforce will allow
you to control even more power from your Heaven Punisher, making it
even mightier. Right now, in the war for the Grand Xia, there’s not
many on the side of the Seamless Gate who are a match for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. For now, at
least, there’s no one who can deal with me. True Immortal
Whitepole, Gatemaster Azurefox, and the White-Faced Flood Dragon
which is under the command of an Empyrean God all had to join forces
together against me, and they still weren’t a match.” In front of
Yu Wei, Ning did something he rarely did; he bragged a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew you’d be
incredible.” Yu Wei was very happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful Ji
Ning was, the greater the chances of his survival would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ji Ning
enjoyed this meal very much. Shortly after they finished…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Wei
suddenly felt a dizzy spell strike her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking?” Yu
Wei’s heart clenched as she realized that it was the Godking
forcibly summoning her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had left
his imprint upon her soul. There was no way she could refuse his
summons at all. When Azurefox wanted to reach Yu Wei, she had to wait
for Yu Wei to fall asleep first…but the Godking could forcibly
reach out to her, not needing to wait for her to go sleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei didn’t dare to
hesitate at all. She immediately said, “Junior apprentice-brother,
I’m full. I’m a bit tired; I’m going to take a nap.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and get
some rest,” Ning immediately said. She was currently pregnant; he
didn’t dare to negligent of her health.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei moved into a
nearby room, lay down on the bed, then shut her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast world of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei appeared out of
nowhere, and as soon as she did she saw that massive royal throne
hovering in the middle of the endless darkness, as well as the
towering figure of the Godking seated upon the throne. She also saw
Gatemaster Azurefox kneeling before the Godking. Yu Wei immediately
knelt down as well. “I prostrate myself before you, Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei,” the
Godking said, “The great battle the Grand Xia Dynasty just fought
against our Seamless Gate…are you aware of it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was somewhat
startled. She immediately nodded. “I do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
suffered a major loss,” the Godking said. “The Grand Xia won a
great victory. Do you know why the Grand Xia won?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei hesitated a
moment, then said, “Because of my junior apprentice-brother, Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew very well that
the Godking had to be aware of all the details regarding the battle.
There was no way any of it could be hidden from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Because of Ji
Ning.” The Godking slowly tapped his fingers against his armrest, a
hint of doubt in his voice. “How could your Dao-companion, Ji Ning,
have increased his power by that much? Did he become a Pure Yang True
Immortal? Or is it because he’s mastered the heartforce techniques
which Old Man Yuan transmitted to him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate
doesn’t know,” Yu Wei said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
The Godking gazed downwards towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s heart shook,
but she forced herself to remain calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe he must
have become a Pure Yang True Immortal,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was surprised.
The Godking already knew the answer?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no way you
can lie in my presence,” the Godking said calmly. “I’ve
summoned you and asked you simply because I wanted to test you…but
in the future, if I ask you for any information regarding the Grand
Xia and you dare to hide anything…then I will exile you into the
Infinity Hells. When that happens…there will never be a chance for
the child of yourself and Ji Ning to enter this world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s heart shook
yet again. This was what she feared the most. The thing she wanted
above all else was to survive until her child was born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive me,
Godking,” Yu Wei said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking just gave
her a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Yu Wei
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking?” Azurefox
raised her head to look at the Godking with a belly filled with
questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that Ji
Ning did not lie to Yu Wei,” the Godking said slowly. “Ji Ning
has indeed come up with a soul heartforce technique. If he is allowed
to grow unimpeded…I’m afraid that the Nuwa Alliance of the Three
Realms shall soon gain yet another hard-to-deal-with Empyrean God or
True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox was even more
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning told Yu Wei
that he made a breakthrough.” The Godking gave his most devoted of
servants an explanation. “A breakthrough in a soul heartforce
technique! However, before this I was concerned that Ji Ning might
have been lying. The best judge of whether or not he was lying would
be Yu Wei, his Dao-companion; she knows him better than any others.
If he lied, Yu Wei should be able to detect it. I could sense,
however, that Yu Wei also believes that Ji Ning has indeed made a
breakthrough in his soul heartforce technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Yu Wei hadn’t
said it, the Godking could completely see through all of Yu Wei’s
thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What the Godking didn’t
realize was that Ning hadn’t told anyone at all that he had broken
through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal. Ning had indeed lied to
Yu Wei. His heartforce was incredibly strong, and so he was able to
reveal no flaws at all when lying. In addition, although Yu Wei had
some vague guesses in her heart, she still had complete faith in
Ning. Ning was the most important person in her life, and so harbored
no doubts about his words at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking with and
querying Yu Wei, in the end the Godking decided that Ji Ning had to
have truly made a breakthrough in heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox hurriedly
said, “That’s good. At least he hasn’t become a Pure Yang True
Immortal yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good?” The Godking
gave Azurefox a sideways glance. “You still don’t understand what
it means for him to have made a soul heartforce breakthrough. In the
Three Realms, there are many who have become Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals, but the number of individuals who have developed soul
heartforce techniques can be counted on two hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan
transmitted his teachings to Ji Ning, but I didn’t expect him to
have mastered them in just three years.” The fog around the
Godking’s black robes seemed to crackle with light. “Ji Ning has
long ago mastered a thread of swordforce, and he has a deep level of
insight into the Dao of the Sword. There is nothing impeding him from
mastering it and becoming a Pure Yang True Immortal; this is just a
matter of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mastering a soul
heartforce technique, however, is extremely difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already
accomplished the most difficult task before him,” the Godking said.
“He’s completely mastered a soul heartforce technique, which
means his control over his Heaven Punisher and the amount of power he
can command has instantly increased tenfold or twentyfold. Once he
also becomes a Pure Yang True Immortal…the power of his Immortal
army will explosively increase yet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When that happens…he
will have become incredibly hard to deal with. The Nuwa Alliance will
have gained yet another lethal weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
hesitant, not sure what to do next.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between the
two alliances was a slow, drawn-out battle where each side was
fighting for every bit of land!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time, they would
whittle away a little bit of their enemy’s strength, but over the
course of many battles, the accumulated amount of damage they had
done would allow them to gain a great advantage! At present, the True
Gods and Daofathers on each side were all unwilling to intervene,
because they knew that once one side intervened, the casualties would
instantly skyrocket. This storm, however, was unavoidable; they had
to fight at some point. At the start, however, they were going to
conserve their strength as much as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals struggled for karmic luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But towards the
end…when one side realized that they no longer had any chances at
all to improve their karmic luck…they would most likely launch
their most frenzied, berserk of assaults!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That would be when the
final battle would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, however,
both sides felt that they had opportunities to improve their karmic
standings, to improve their karmic luck. If they were able to do so,
then Heaven and Earth would be on their side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in this battle for
karmic luck…some extremely special Empyrean Gods or True Immortals
could be tremendously effective in this regard, such as Lu Dongbin
and his Eight Immortals of the High Caves, or the terrifying divine
archers. If Ji Ning was to master a soul heartforce technique and
become a Pure Yang True Immortal, the army he commanded would be able
to become an important variable that had a major influence on the
entire war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s left
hand slowly but continuously tapped against the armrest of his
throne. Tap. Tap. Tap. Azurefox felt as though each tap was a tap
striking upon her very heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the Godking’s
left arm came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox lifted up her
head. She could feel as though the entire world of darkness had just
solidified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flash of lightning
seemed to have appeared within the Godking’s eyes. He said coldly,
“Sooner or later, we will need to fight a decisive final battle
against Crimsonbright. Then…let this final battle’s location be
the world of the Grand Xia. Make your preparations. I will summon the
power of the Fifth World and send them to descend upon the Grand Xia.
We’ll prepare for a Realmwar and get rid of Ji Ning at the same
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmwar?”
Azurefox was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, the war
against a major world would explode beyond one’s expectations. The
major powers on both sides would constantly reinforce their
subordinates, resulting in a massive war which the majority of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals within that realm would participate
in, along with a truly countless number of the realm’s Celestial
Immortals and True Immortals. This sort of war…was known as a
Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and
prepare,” the Godking ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Azurefox
said respectfully. She immediately departed from the world of
darkness.

Chapter 27 - Ambush
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since that
ancient, primordial war had resulted in the shattering of the world
and the creation of the Three Realms, the Heaven Realm had been the
largest remnant-world that had been left behind. The aura of the
Heaven Realm was very similar to that of the aura of the ancient
world. In this vast realm, the Celestial Court merely held partial
sway, commanding the eastern reaches. Mount Ling of the Buddhists was
located in the west, and the many Buddhas were all located there,
resulting it in having a much higher status than the Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Celestial
Emperor saw the Buddhas, he would have to behave with the utmost of
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Buddhas were all
figures comparable to True Gods and Daofathers, after all; at most,
they would be superficially courteous to the Celestial Emperor, the
nominal leader of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Realm was
also filled with sacred grounds of the Daoist Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daoist Path, the
Buddhist Sangha…they were the true powers of the Heaven Realm.
Second only to them were the various major powers. Of course, there
were many other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals with their own turfs
and territories in this realm as well, where their rule held sway.
They paid no attention to the Celestial Emperor at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Realm. Mount
Tonglian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great King! Great
King!” A Void-level mouse-type Diremonster flew forward, calling
out loudly. He soon reached a great palace, inside of which were six
Diremonsters Gods with difference appearances. These six Diremonster
Gods were drinking from cauldrons of wine and eating large chunks of
meat with utter relish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” A
massively, burly, golden-eyed Diremonster God with long whiskers
barked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void-level
Diremonster hurriedly knelt down with a thud. “Great King, True
Immortal Songcloud has sent an emissary inviting the six of you go
gather at his Cloudsong Mountain half a year from now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Songcloud?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Diremonster
Gods immediately shook off the effects of the wine, becoming
completely sober. They each exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. True
Immortal Songcloud always wastes time dithering about. Us six
brothers, our time is incredibly precious, and we’re not in a mood
to go out wandering. Tell the emissary to f*ck off.” A tall, skinny
Diremonster God whose face was covered with azure scales barked out
at the mouse Diremonster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes, yes!”
The Void-level Diremonster immediately retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. I’m feeling a
bit woozy from all the wine. I’m going to take a nap.” The
golden-eyed Diremonster immediately lay down and began to snore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to nap
as well.” Yet another lay down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you won’t
drink, I will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the six
Diremonster Gods went to sleep, while others continued to drink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But even though they
continued to drink…as Empyrean Gods, they were naturally able to
easily create lesser clones of themselves. Their clones were all
hiding within their respective Immortal estates, and they immediately
went to sleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Realm.
Cloudmist Creek.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the flows
of Cloudmist Creek, there was an underwater palace. There were all
sorts of monsters serving within this underwater palace, including
shrimp soldiers and crab commanders. The masters of this underwater
estate were the famous Nine Cloudmist Fairies. The Nine Cloudmist
Fairies…although they were described as ‘Fairies’, in reality
they were Diremonsters who had trained to reach the Empyrean God or
True Immortal level. Because they shared deep affection for each
other, advancing and retreating in lockstep, they became famously
tough to deal with in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When all nine of them
joined forces…unless a True God or a Daofather intervened, there
were very few in the Three Realms who could do anything to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sisters, enough
play. It’s time to train. The storm has come, and we can’t waste
any time or relax.” The eldest sister of the nine, Fairy Skycloud,
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our eldest sister
speaks the truth.” The other beautiful Diremonsters all assented to
her words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all returned to
their still rooms, ostensibly to train…but in reality, they entered
the realm of dreams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast world
of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Godking sat
upon his towering, thirty thousand meter throne, his black robes cast
around him like a dark mist. He sat there, quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One group of Immortals
and Fiendgods after another began to appear before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has the Godking
summoned us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? This many
people?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The six Diremonster
Gods of Mount Tonglian have arrived. The Nine Cloudmist Fairies have
arrived as well? Hey, aren’t those the three Diremonster Gods of
Mount Dragoneater? So they are on our side as well? Last time, the
three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater killed two Bodhisattva’s
of the Buddhist Sangha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Immortals and
Fiendgods began to congregate, all at the Empyrean God or True
Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some weaker
ones who were ‘ordinary’ Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, but
the likes of the six Diremonster Gods of Mount Tonglian, the Nine
Cloudmist Fairies, and the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater stood at the very top. Although the Godking had a hundred
Seamless Gates, supreme powers like those three reported directly to
the Godking himself! The other Seamless Gates were unable to give
orders to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We prostrate
ourselves before you, Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We prostrate
ourselves before you, Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they all felt
shock in their hearts upon arriving, they all knelt down
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time passed, more
and more Immortals and Fiendgods arrived, with True Immortal
Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox included amongst them. When the
sixty-eighth member arrived, the Godking, seated upon his high
throne, finally spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Crimsonbright
Realm is under the control of Daofather Crimsonbright.” The
Godking’s voice rang out, filling every inch of this vast, dark
world as well as the hearts of his subordinates. “If the Seamless
Gate is to gain in karmic luck, then we have to take control of many
major worlds. Our previous battles against the Crimsonbright Realm
were merely small skirmishes, and Daofather Crimsonbright has been
holding his own power in reserve as well. Both of our sides have been
preparing for a true Realmwar to begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals seated below were startled. They were
immediately able to guess at what the Godking had summoned them for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we do not
completely destroy them, we won’t be able to stabilize our control
over their major worlds. We must gain victory in the Realmwar; we
must defeat them completely.” The Godking’s voice turned icy. “If
we can defeat them in the Realmwar, then the worlds of the
Crimsonbright Realm will become powerless to resist us, allowing us
to win them over with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we do not defeat
them…then they will be able to push us out from even the major
worlds we’ve taken over for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Realmwar against
the Crimsonbright Realm…shall be located on the world of the Grand
Xia!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking made his
announcement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had an
extremely high status amongst the high-level major powers of the
Seamless Gate. In addition…the still-slumbering presence had only
taken on a single apprentice; the Godking! This made the Godking’s
status quite transcendental; so long as he didn’t commit a major
error, the Godking would usually remain in control over the full
forces of the Seamless Gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The current master
of the Grand Xia is a member of the Primordial Imperial Clan, Xiamang
Sun. This Xia Emperor’s power is quite formidable,” the Godking
said. “Azurefox commanded her forces to clash against the Xia
Emperor numerous times, but at present she is losing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Losing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Immortals
and Fiendgods looked towards Azurefox. They all knew that Azurefox
was completely devoted to the Godking. Amongst the individuals
present, some were fanatically loyal while some had been seduced by
the great power the Seamless Gate had to offer, which was why they
had joined. Even those, however, were afforded tremendous respect by
the Seamless Gate, due to their own power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why she
is losing is because a new variable has emerged on the side of the
Grand Xia’s Xia Emperor; a variable named Ji Ning,” the Godking
said. “The Heaven Punisher he commands is incredibly powerful. As
for exactly how powerful…spend some time chatting with Azurefox,
and you’ll all understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” they
all assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve summoned you
here in such a cautious way because…I want you to launch a sneak
attack.” The Godking’s eyes flashed with lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sneak attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present began
to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, the Grand
Xia is most likely celebrating their great success. I trust they are
planning to completely wipe out Azurefox’s forces,” the Godking
said. “After you all assemble at the world of the Grand Xia, stay
in hiding; just accompany Azurefox and the others as they fight. When
the time comes…all of you are to appear simultaneously. Wipe out
all of the forces of the Xia Emperor. Leave no survivors!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The
Immortals and Fiendgods all grew eager.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ambush?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An unexpected surprise.
Given their power, they were indeed overwhelmingly more powerful and
would indeed be capable of utterly crushing and slaughtering the Xia
Emperor’s forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most important
aspect to this ambush…is to be careful. No matter what, do not let
this information leak out,” the Godking said solemnly. “Some of
the major powers within the Nuwa Alliance are able to watch the
entire Three Realms. That Subhuti in particular…he is Ji Ning’s
master, and is most likely keeping an eye on the war for the Grand
Xia. He’s also capable of using his [Dream of the Three Realms]…one
he finds out, our ambush will fail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So Ji Ning is
Subhuti’s disciple.” All of the Immortals and Fiendgods were
secretly surprised, and they grew even more wary of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because
Daofather Subhuti was legendary for his ability to teach and train
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be
careful. For now, gather and remain in the Void beyond the Three
Realms,” the Godking instructed. “That way, Subhuti will not be
able to discover you. Then, go into hiding and have the two Jueming
Immortals use their Protocosmic spirit-treasure to tear a hole to the
Void, bringing you straight into Azurefox’s Seamless City. That
way, even if Subhuti discovers the two of you, he’ll only think
that you are there to provide reinforcements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone below the
throne nodded. Indeed. Right now, Azurefox’s Seamless Gate was
losing. If she asked the Godking for reinforcements, and the Godking
hadn’t decided to initiate a Realmwar…sending out the two Jueming
Immortals as reinforcements was indeed his original plan. Thus, this
sort of arrangement made sense and didn’t have any visible flaws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. The most
important component of this ambush is for it to remain a secret,”
the Godking reminded them once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” they
all acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were quite
eager. They would first wipe out all of the Xia Emperor’s forces,
including the one named Ji Ning. Then, they would engage in a battle
against the army of Daofather Crimsonbright. If they were able to
wipe out the Xia Emperor’s forces, the Realmwar would be easier for
them to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
forces naturally were completely oblivious that the Godking was
summoning his forces within the dreamworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
filled with complete confident right now. He stood in midair as he
said in a loud voice, “Everyone, we are extremely close to victory.
We need to seize this chance to kill more of the Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Seamless Gate. We are going to expel them from the
Grand Xia and make it so that they never again dare to invade. If
they choose to fight to the death…then we will wipe them all out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless gathered
Immortals and Fiendgods all roared loudly. Their morale was at an
all-time high…and the Xia Emperor was filled with confidence as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entirety of
Whitepole Commandery was trapped within his formation. Not even
Greater Teleportation would allow anyone to enter this place. The
only possibility was if someone forcibly tore a hole through
space…but if that was to happen, he would definitely notice! Once
he saw any signs that the Seamless Gate was being reinforced, he
would ask Daofather Crimsonbright for help. Daofather Crimsonbright
had promised the Xia Emperor that if the Xia Emperor was able to
force the enemy to call for reinforcements, he would definitely help
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s head to the
Seamless City!” The Xia Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, many grand
formations began to take shape within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One massive, towering
Heaven Punisher after another began to take form, as well as the even
more massive Pangu War-Formations. Although some Fiendgods had
perished, most were still alive. The two remaining Pangu
War-Formations had lent the destroyed one some of their forces, and
so they were still able to form three of the Pangu War-Formations!
That massively powerful Raindragon swam about in the air above them
as well…and the Empyrean God golems were all activated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful aura
of them all, however…belonged to the Heaven Punisher that wielded
two massive swords in its hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Military
morale was at a peak as the mighty, awe-inspiring army suddenly
vanished into thin air, having teleported outside the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.

Chapter 28 - Daofather Crimsonbright’s Reinforcements
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
returned to the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back already? Didn’t
you just go out to fight a short while ago?” They were back in the
military camp, and Yu Wei was looking towards Ning in surprise. The
Immortals of the Darknorth Army had been sent back to their
respective residences. As they returned, they were all chattering
about how ‘the Seamless Gate was so cowardly that it was unwilling
to even fight,’ and how ‘it seems as though the Seamless Gate
recognizes that it is about to lose’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked into his
room, sitting down by a desk. He poured himself a glass of wine, then
said with a smile, “The Seamless Gate is feeling nervous now. We
were shouting for them to come fight for a long time, but they
refused to come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they are going to
just hide there…then what should we do?” Yu Wei was worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they aren’t
willing to fight, that’s a good thing.” Ning laughed. “Ideally,
they’d never come out to fight again. So long as they don’t
fight, the Grand Xia will remain the Xia Emperor’s, and the karmic
luck of the Grand Xia will remain on our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has two paths ahead of it right now,” Ning said. “The first path
sees them abandoning their designs on the Grand Xia. The second path
is for them to summon even more of their forces to take it by force.
I hope they take the first path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
filled with a desire to do battle, his wife was pregnant; he wanted
to calmly and peacefully accompany her and watch his child be born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
probably won’t just admit defeat like that,” Yu Wei said softly,
thinking back to the world of darkness and the Godking within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Right.
I’ve only killed True Immortal Crimsonjoy; the Seamless Gate hasn’t
really been hurt yet. For them to admit defeat right away? The
chances of that are very low.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out to
gently stroke Yu Wei’s protruding belly. He couldn’t help but
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what storms
and tempests awaited him…there were some things he absolutely had
to protect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Void beyond
the Three Realms, on a shattered, destroyed planet that was covered
in countless scars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scars had been left
behind by a battle between two major powers. Atop this shattered
planet, twenty nine Empyrean Gods and True Immortals had gathered,
with more on the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this Realmwar, we
will be following the three Diremonster Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard long
ago of their power. This time, we’ll have a chance to see it for
ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various figures
began to chat with some of the more powerful Immortals and Fiendgods,
paying the most attention to the ‘Three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater’. These three Diremonster gods were shockingly
powerful, and were considered by their fellow Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals as being nearly invincible. Each of the three were more
powerful than the Xia Emperor or True Immortal Whitepole!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their decision to join
the Seamless Gate had utterly enraged the Nuwa Alliance upon the Nuwa
Alliance finding out. Alas, there was nothing the Nuwa Alliance could
do; both sides were doing their absolute best to recruit the powerful
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Three Realms to their
respective sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, the Three
Realms had been at peace. Many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were
free and unaffiliated with any organizations. Now, with the storm
having come, they had to choose a side. Only the most supreme of
powers, such as Old Man Yuan’s faction, were still able to watch
and wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone’s here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of our fellow
Daoists have arrived.” Two Immortals who looked very similar to
each other laughed. Both had large faces and were fairly chubby. One
was dressed in white robes, while the other was dressed in gray robes
that were loose enough to reveal his bare chest. These two were the
exceptionally famous ‘Twin Jueming Immortals’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists,
please enter this gourd first.” The white-robed Immortal took out a
gourd, opening its stopper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was merely an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure; the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
present were more than capable of forcibly breaking their way out of
it if needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, one streak
of light after another flew towards the mouth of the gourd.
Afterwards, the white-robed Immortal plugged the gourd again, then
slung it over his shoulders. Smiling, he said, “Elder brother,
let’s go to Whitepole Commandery of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
gray-robed figure nodded, then immediately used a spatial technique
to teleport straight to the world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, the gray-robed
figure took out a black Protocosmic spirit-treasure that looked like
a ruler. He sliced it through the air, carving out a spatial
corridor. Through the spatial corridor, one could see that the other
side was connected to a location where a massive, towering black
citadel lay hanging in the air. This was the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
two Jueming Immortals immediately flew into the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Whitepole
Commandery. The hovering Seamless City. A spatial tear appeared in
the air above the levitating city, and two chubby Immortals came out
from the spatial tear, flying towards the Seamless City below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our two fellow
Daoists have arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Jue
and fellow Daoist Ming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gatemaster Azurefox and
True Immortal Whitepole all immediately went forward to greet the
two, the other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals right behind them.
The likes of the Hallmaster, Empyrean God Beastleave, and Empyrean
God Venomsong all called out in a very familiar manner. “So it’s
the two Jueming Immortals. Now that you two have arrived, fellow
Daoists, our side’s chances of gaining victory have increased
greatly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With your spells by
our side, we’ll no longer have to fear the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox and Whitepole
exchanged a few glances with the Twin Jueming Immortals. They didn’t
even send any mental messages. All of them were being extremely
cautious, for fear that the Nuwa Alliance would find out. If the Nuwa
Alliance found out, they would lose their chance to ambush their
foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor was upon the walls, gazing at the vast wilderness outside and
the distant Seamless City as he reflected quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space trembled. The Xia
Emperor’s grand formation had taken complete control over the
surrounding million kilometers of space. Upon the Twin Jueming
Immortals forcibly tearing a path to the Seamless City, the Xia
Emperor immediately noticed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Xia
Emperor frowned as he looked towards the spatial tear. Upon seeing
the two chubby Immortals fly out from the spatial rift, the Xia
Emperor immediately understood. “The Twin Jueming Immortals? It’s
actually the two of them? The Seamless Gate really views me quite
highly. Although these two Immortals cannot compare to Ji Ning’s
Heaven Punisher, their spells are quite formidable. With their spells
supporting an army, the Seamless Gate’s total combat power will
have risen by an entire level. If we continue to fight against
them…it’s hard to say who would win!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seat of
enlightenment of Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather was
seated upon his throne, with dozens of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals standing before him. They were all staring at the
battle-scene that was playing out within the round mirror of light in
midair. This was the Realmwar that was occurring within the Winesun
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmwars truly are
vicious. This is the third time I’ve seen a Realmwar, but I still
shudder at what I am seeing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than twelve of
our Empyrean Gods and True Immortals have died within the Winesun
Realm. The Seamless Gate has only lost seven!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The golems of the
Seamless Gate truly are unequaled within the Three Realms. If they
didn’t have so many terrifying golems, the Seamless Gate would’ve
lost ago. Now, however…it’s Daofather Winesun’s side which is
at a disadvantage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were all watching worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this war was
going on within the Winesun Realm, Daofather Winesun and Daofather
Crimsonbright were in the same alliance, after all. They all hoped
that Daofather Winesun’s forces would gain victory; in fact, some
of them itched to personally charge into the fray as well. However,
they understood that it was up to the Daofathers to decide when they
would join a battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofathers would at
most send a few Empyrean Gods and True Immortals as reinforcements.
If Daofather Crimsonbright sent all their forces…then once a
Realmwar exploded within the Crimsonbright Realm, what were they to
do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flames of war had
spread across the entire Three Realms, after all; the Winesun Realm
was merely one part of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miserable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a miserable
sight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of those who were
watching the Realmwar take place felt their hearts shudder. Almost
none of them had ever experienced such a catastrophic, miserable war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the Xia
Emperor’s clone said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Daofather
Crimsonbright looked towards the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple just
discovered that the Seamless Gate’s branch in the Grand Xia has
just received reinforcements. The Twin Jueming Immortals are now with
them,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals who had been watching the Winesun Realm’s Realmwar
all immediately turned their heads. No matter how important that war
was, they still cared the most about the events within the
Crimsonbright Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Twin Jueming
Immortals?” Daofather Crimsonbright nodded gently. He pondered a
moment, glancing downwards. “Who amongst you is willing to go aid
the Grand Xia and your fellow disciple, Xiamang, in defeating the
Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am willing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone replied in
chorus. In the face of this great tribulation, no one could shirk
back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
smiled as he looked carefully at his host of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals. Some had their own major worlds to protect, while others
had only sent their clones to this place. Soon, Daofather
Crimsonbright’s gaze turned towards two solitary figures.
“Snowdance, Evergreen, the two of you shall head to the Grand Xia
and assist your senior apprentice-brother Xiamang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen and Fairy Snowdance naturally wouldn’t dare to disobey,
and so they immediately assented to the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
solitary figures who were not attached to any worlds. They could be
sent to any place where they were needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space itself began to
grow blurry, especially the space around Daofather Crimsonbright,
which became opaque and misty. There was no way at all one could see
past the blurred space. This caused the Xia Emperor and the others to
feel completely amazed; why would their master, Daofather
Crimsonbright, suddenly unleash this sort of a formation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
stared at his surroundings, puzzled. The space around him had already
become completely twisted, and within the twisted, distorted space
appeared a bearded old man dressed in Daoist robes. It was Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said in surprise, hurriedly rising to his
feet. “Why’ve you come to my place? The last time you sought me
out, it was for the sake of your disciple, Ji Ning. This time, you’ve
come to speak to me again…is there something you need me to do?
However, your disciple is doing well right now. The Heaven Punisher
he commands has extraordinary power; he doesn’t need my help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not here to
ask for your help; I’m here to help you,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me?”
Daofather Crimsonbright was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti calmly sat
down. Daofather Crimsonbright walked towards him, then waved his
hand. A wooden table immediately appeared before them, covered with
precious Immortal wines. He personally poured a cup of wine for
Subhuti. Subhuti and Crimsonbright were on extremely good terms with
each other; they had both been born from the primordial chaos, after
all, and both were True Gods of Primordial Chaos. They had supported
each other in life-and-death battles for many years, and in truth the
relationship between them was no less than the relationship between
Subhuti and Threelives had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this about,
exactly?” Daofather Crimsonbright asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, you were
about to send your disciples to the Grand Xia, yes? You were sending
them to the deaths.” Subhuti went straight to the heart of the
matter: “Not just your two disciples; I imagine that few to none of
the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under Xiamang will survive. But
of course, my disciple will definitely survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the seven Empyrean
Gods protecting Ning…although the seven wouldn’t be able to
overcome the ambushing army, they’d still be able to ensure that he
could escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t just sit
there like a fool. The Realmwar for your Crimsonbright Realm is about
to begin. All of your disciples and students have to fight for their
lives, now.” Subhuti let out a sigh, then raised his head and
downed a cup of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmwar?!”
Daofather Crimsonbright shot to his feet, knocking aside his winecup,
splashing wine all over the table.
</P>

Chapter 29 - Openly And Honorably
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti…”
Daofather Crimsonbright stared at Subhuti. He couldn’t resist from
saying, “Is this really true?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I’d
lie to you about something like this?” Subhuti sat there, calmly
drinking his wine. “You shouldn’t be so shocked. We’ve already
had multiple Realmwars against the Seamless Gate within the Three
Realms. It isn’t odd for one to have begun within your
Crimsonbright realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
nodded slowly. Only now did he sit down, then sigh, “Right. Sooner
or later, a Realmwar was going to come to my Crimsonbright Realm. But
now that it really is happening…I still feel pained. My
disciples…my students…they’ve been by my side for countless
ages. They are all like my own children. But now, I’m going to
watch them fight within a Realmwar…watch them die, one by one…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, too, had many
disciples; he knew exactly how Crimsonbright felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all born as
True Gods of Primordial Chaos, and as such had no actual children.
Their cherished disciples were as important to them as actual
children were to ordinary mortals. This was amplified by the fact
that they would often spend countless ages training and accompanying
their disciples, resulting in extremely deep relationships.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps, as major
powers, they would have the mental fortitude to watch one of their
disciples die without interfering…but when nearly all of their
disciples were facing possible death, of course they would truly feel
heartache and panic. How many of them were truly willing to suddenly
become alone and bereft of all their loved ones?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti.”
Daofather Crimsonbright nodded solemnly. “Thank you for your
warning. If it wasn’t for you…Xiamang’s side would’ve been
doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti just chuckled,
lifting his cup of wine and continuing to drink in a leisurely
fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Since they
plan to ambush Xiamang’s forces,” Crimsonbright suddenly said,
“Should I do the same? I can openly send some limited
reinforcements, while secretly prepare a vicious little trap for
them. Shall we give them a taste of their own medicine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
Subhuti shook his head. “You know exactly how formidable the
Seamless Gate’s intelligence network is. It is far too difficult
for you to mobilize your forces without the Seamless Gate finding
out! Even if we really were so lucky as to avoid discovery…do you
have any idea as to how many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals the
Seamless Gate has actually sent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many?”
Crimsonbright immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty-six,”
Subhuti said calmly. “They include the six Diremonster Gods of
Mount Tonglian, and the Nine Cloudmist Fairies…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crimsonbright’s face
instantly became ugly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They also number
amongst the ranks the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater,
who recently caused the Buddhists to suffer catastrophic losses,”
Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? They came as
well?” The look on Crimsonbright’s face completely changed.
“But…but…this is merely a war against my Crimsonbright Realm.
For the Seamless Gate to summon the six from Mount Tonglian and the
nine from the Cloudmist Creek is one thing…but they even summoned
the three from Mount Dragoneater?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unless a Daofather
acted against them, it could be said that those three mighty
Diremonster Gods were nigh-invincible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know?”
Subhuti shook his head. “No matter what, the three Diremonster Gods
of Mount Dragoneater have indeed gone to the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Subhuti didn’t
realize…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was that the reason why
the Godking had sent the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater
was because he wanted to neatly and cleanly get rid of the
troublesome Ji Ning. As the Godking saw it, Ji Ning had already
mastered a soul heartforce technique; once he became a Pure Yang True
Immortal, his Heaven Punisher would probably be a match for those
three Diremonster Gods, all by itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the Godking
had guessed wrongly; the number of figures within the Three Realms
who had truly mastered a soul heartforce technique could be counted
on two hands. No matter how monstrously talented Ji Ning was, and
despite him having been taught the [Heart Sutra] of Old Man Yuan, he
had only been able to just barely gain a basic level of skill in the
technique. He couldn’t even be considered as being an expert in it,
much less have mastered it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this decision
to get rid of Ji Ning was indeed the right decision for the Seamless
Gate. This was because, although Ning had only just reached a basic
level of skill, as time went on his skills in the soul heartforce
technique would only grow more and more profound, and he would prove
to be a greater and greater threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve said
everything I came to say,” Subhuti said. “Crimsonbright, deal
with this information as you see fit.” After speaking, Subhuti
disappeared into thin air, and the distorted field of space once more
went back to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
waved his hand, collecting the table of wine in front of him, then
glanced downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals seated below him could now see him again. They were
all very puzzled, but none of them dared to ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve all seen
the Winesun Realm’s Realmwar,” Daofather Crimsonbright said,
pointing towards the round mirror of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What of it? Were they
about to be sent as reinforcements?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your peaceful,
relaxed days have come to an end. Our Crimsonbright Realm’s
Realmwar has begun!” Daofather Crimsonbright continued calmly, “The
major powers of the Seamless Gate have already sent a large group of
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to descend upon the Grand Xia. They
include the six Diremonster Gods of Mount Tonglian, but we can
discuss those details later. All you need to know for now is that
their reinforcements include more than just the Twin Jueming
Immortals; rather, their reinforcements include a total of sixty-six
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, including the three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s faces
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixty-six?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Including the forces
that the Seamless Gate already had within the Grand Xia, such as True
Immortal Whitepole and Azurefox…didn’t that mean a total of
nearly eighty would take part in the war? Eighty Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals…what a terrifying force that was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Could it be…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is now a
Realmwar!” Daofather Crimsonbright looked downwards. “No one can
escape it. Go and make your preparations for your various worlds.
Protect them all securely. Any remaining forces are to be pooled
together and sent to the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The
Immortals and Fiendgods all assented solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
body was covered in cold sweat. The Twin Jueming Immortals were
actually…actually just a façade for the sixty-six Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals? The Xia Emperor felt terrified just thinking
about what would’ve happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who do not
need to go summon their armies or arrange for various logistics
should head out immediately.” Daofather Crimsonbright began to give
orders. “Head straight to Xiamang’s ‘Eight Dragons Cloudcity’
in an open, aboveboard manner. Put an end to the Seamless Gate’s
fantasies of ambushing us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
did have more than a hundred Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under
his command, but battles were currently occurring on various other
major worlds as well; he had to leave some of them behind to protect
his other major worlds. If he left none behind, the Seamless Gate
would be able to effortlessly take them over. Thus, the number of
individuals which Daofather Crimsonbright could employ was actually
limited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, there were
also lone wanderers such as Sword Immortal Evergreen, Fairy
Snowdance, True Immortal Riverstar, and Empyrean God Fufang. The
figures from the fairly stable major worlds could also be sent to the
Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day,
twenty-six Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were sent to the Grand
Xia as part of the first wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia.
Whitepole Commandery. Outside the Seamless City, the black chains
continued to rustle as they anchored the city into the void. Inside
was a hubbub of noise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To prevent the Xia
Emperor from growing suspicious, True Immortal Whitepole and the
others didn’t launch an immediate attack. Instead, they had done
what they would normally do; they first held a welcoming banquet for
the Twin Jueming Immortals. The plan was to call out the Xia
Emperor’s forces after they finished the banquet! If they were too
impatient, they wouldn’t achieve their desired goals. The more
critical things were, the steadier one had to be in handling them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, drink!” True
Immortal Whitepole laughed loudly. “Now that the Twin Jueming
Immortals have arrived, we’ll be able to suppress the Xia Emperor’s
side in terms of supportive spells. The power of our Empyrean God
golems and Bloodcloud golems will improve greatly, giving us a chance
to win!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Spells and
enchantments can have a huge impact on golems. We have far more
golems than them; we were in desperate need of the Twin Jueming
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can definitely
win this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were laughing and jesting about while drinking. Then,
suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of their faces
changed. They could clearly sense the enormous ripples that were
being generated through a spatial rift being opened. The spatial rift
in question was very close to them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.” True Immortal Whitepole remained quite calm. Winecup still
in hand, he chortled as he rose to his feet. He took a single step
and appeared outside of the banquet hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
One after another, the experts all left the banquet hall and flew
into the air above the Seamless City. They stared towards the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in the distance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity had appeared. Eight divine dragons were roving around it,
giving it an aura that was even mightier than that of the Seamless
City. A spatial rift had already appeared above it, and one Empyrean
God and True Immortal after another began to emerge from the rift and
fly towards the Eight Dragons Cloudcity below. These Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals were chatting and jesting with each other,
appearing to be quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under Daofather Crimsonbright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many have
already entered the Eight Dragons Cloudcity? From the looks of it,
there must be at least twenty of them. As to how many will
arrive…hard to say.” They all had completely different looks on
their faces as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two chubby Jueming
Immortals, who had been beaming merrily in a very amiable way, now
had flat looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flames of rage blazed
in Azurefox’s eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the field
marshal…True Immortal Whitepole, who had managed to remain calm up
till now, could no longer remain calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! The winecup in
his hand shattered, breaking apart into tiny dust-like pieces. The
wine splashed out, but before the wine even drew close to him, it
froze into pieces of ice and fell to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn! DAMN!!!”
True Immortal Whitepole couldn’t refrain from cursing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the field marshal,
the fact that he had been forced to request reinforcements had
already deeply disappointed the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ambush was
extremely important. In an head-on fight in a Realmwar, killing ten
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals was incredibly difficult and
required an enormous cost to be paid. Their ambush, however, would’ve
allowed them to easily and effortlessly wipe out the Xia Emperor’s
forces. But now…they could all tell that their plot had failed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it have
failed?!” True Immortal Whitepole gritted his teeth. Almost.
Almost! He had almost wiped out the Xia Emperor and all his forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the military
camps of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity, quite a few Loose Immortals and
Celestial Immortals had emerged from their respective residences to
stare up into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei
actually flew out of the entire camp. They stood there in midair,
watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Unity, Dustfloat, Whacko, Rainsoar, and Allbeasts were standing in
midair and watching as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous rift had
appeared in the skies, and one figure after another was flying out
from it, each possessing auras of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to be Empyrean
Gods or True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many of them?”
Ning was somewhat stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come to the main
palace right away.” The Xia Emperor’s voice rang out within the
minds of Ji Ning, Celestial Immortal Unity, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to go to the
main palace,” Ning said to Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Yu Wei
nodded. Ning was a commander; he naturally had to participate in the
discussions involving this momentous event.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main palace.
Xiamang was seated atop his throne in the principal position, while
more than thirty Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, along with Ning
and the rest of the five, were seated before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We actually just
gained twenty-six Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. What in the world
has happened, for us to suddenly gain so many? If we are to launch an
ambush, why didn’t they come secretly? The entire region of a
million kilometers around us is under the Xia Emperor’s control; he
could’ve had them come in secret, then launch a sneak attack
against the Seamless Gate.” Ning’s heart was filled with
questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, seated
up high on his throne, explained: “I imagine that none of you know
what is going on. The reason why Master has sent so many Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals to reinforce us…is because the Seamless
Gate is about to launch a Realmwar against our Crimsonbright Realm,
and the location shall be our Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmwar?” Ning
and the others were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Whitepole hasn’t merely invited the Twin Jueming Immortals; he’s
actually gained a total of sixty-six Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals,” the Xia Emperor said solemnly. He paused for a moment,
giving Ning and the others some time to digest this stunning
information, then continued. “However, our side has discovered
their plot, and so Master has first sent a vanguard of twenty-six
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, with the main army arriving later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow disciples
already know about all of you,” the Xia Emperor said with a laugh.
“However, I imagine that most of you don’t recognize them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me make the
introductions. This is my senior apprentice-brother, Hiddenvoid.
Senior apprentice-brother Hiddenvoid was the first to follow Master,
and the Hiddenvoid Formation he created is quite incredible,” the
Xia Emperor said. “This is my junior apprentice-sister Snowdance…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the gazes of
these twenty-plus Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were focused on
and shifted between Sword Immortal Evergreen and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 - The Daofathers Descend
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor made
the introductions, one by one. Ji Ning had heard of some of these
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, although he had never met them
before. There were also some he had never heard of. Not everyone was
as famous as Lu Dongbin, after all…but one’s power couldn’t be
judged by one’s fame. Some especially reclusive Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals might have power comparable to Lu Dongbin’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is junior
apprentice-brother Evergreen,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said
with a laugh as he glanced towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
gave Sword Immortal Evergreen a careful look. This was a young man
who had a strange-looking face and an outstanding aura of talent. He
couldn’t help but muse to himself, “So he is Sword Immortal
Evergreen? The Xia Emperor once asked him to accept me as his
disciple, and he agreed, transferring a message talisman to me.
However…I instead went to Mount Innerheart and didn’t take him on
as my teacher.” Ning felt somewhat apologetic towards this Sword
Immortal Evergreen; after all, he had gone off to Mount Innerheart
without saying a thing. Although Sword Immortal Evergreen’s
instructions were that if Ning let ten days pass without shattering
the talisman, he would take it as Ning having refused…Ning had
slipped out in a rather stealthy fashion, afraid that the Xia Emperor
would stop him. To be fair, that wasn’t the most straightforward
and honest of actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, Ji Ning
nearly became apprenticed to junior apprentice-brother Evergreen,”
the Xia Emperor said with a laugh. “Come to think of it, it can be
said that there are karmic ties between the two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful
greetings, senior Evergreen,” Ning immediately said. “Back then,
I ignored your good intentions…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back then, I didn’t
actually want to take you on as my disciple.” Sword Immortal
Evergreen spoke quite calmly. “Because Master instructed it, I
agreed to take you on as my disciple. I’ve never been good at
teaching disciples; if you had followed me, you probably wouldn’t
be as accomplished as you are now. It is good that you have become
apprenticed to a Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words contained
arrogance within them; it was as though Evergreen was implying that
he had never taken notice of Ning, and that Ning should be thankful
that he was lucky enough to become apprenticed to a Daofather. His
words were as sharp as a sword, and they caused Ning to feel
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Sword Evergreen
Immortal…he really cares nothing about friendship at all,” Fairy
Rainsoar mused to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were Ji
Ning…just based on his attitude alone, I wouldn’t even bother to
speak to this man,” Celestial Immortal Unity mused silently to
himself as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed. “Ji Ning, junior apprentice-brother Evergreen is always by
himself in seclusion, and is a Sword Immortal; his bones are steeped
in pride. Although his words are often unpleasan to the ear, he
doesn’t have any ill intentions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. My words are
indeed unpleasant to hear; I say whatever I wish to say.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, you are a
straightforward man.” Ning smiled, not saying anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some people
whom you simply couldn’t converse peaceably with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had previously felt
a hint of embarrassment, but this simple interaction made Ning feel
certain that it was best for him to keep his distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor held a
special celebratory banquet for the newcomers. Although Sword
Immortal Evergreen was cold and arrogant, there were many other
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals present. With so many people there,
things naturally became quite lively, and so this Immortal banquet
was a joyful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the Xia Emperor
was relaxing in a carefree manner, True Immortal Whitepole of the
Seamless Gate was having an absolutely miserable time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast world
of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Whitepole
and Gatemaster Azurefox, the two fellow disciples, were both on their
knees. The towering, black-robed figure seated upon that distant,
massive throne caused them to feel dread in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, please
pardon us for our crimes,” True Immortal Whitepole said nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was the
Godking’s disciple, he still usually referred to him as ‘Godking’
rather than ‘Master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had a heart
that was as cold as ice. When he gave instructions to his
subordinates, he usually only cared about the results. Their ‘sneak
attack’ plan had died in the cradle; they hadn’t even had the
chance to initiate it. Although this really had nothing to do with
True Immortal Whitepole, in the Godking’s heart…the value and
trust he placed in Whitepole had dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Ink Bamboo
will descend upon the Grand Xia for this Realmwar. He will take
control over everything,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather is
descending?” True Immortal Whitepole and Gatemaster Azurefox were
both stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
was one of the oldest members of the Seamless Gate, who had been
alive when it had first been founded. He had experienced the war that
resulted in the destruction of the Primordial Era, and had managed to
safely survive it. However, since the Godking’s status was very
special due to the fact that he was the sole disciple of that
slumbering presence, Daofather Ink Bamboo was willing to assist the
Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitepole, you have
deeply disappointed me. There is no way I can possibly let you manage
the Realmwar now,” the Godking said. “Thus, Daofather Ink Bamboo
shall personally manage it. But of course, he won’t personally
intervene. Once the Daofathers begin to personally intervene, it’s
possible that the Endwar will suddenly happen, earlier than we
intend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Daofather Ink Bamboo
dared to attack, then the Nuwa Alliance’s major powers would strike
out as well. The other Daofathers of the Seamless Gate would then
help Ink Bamboo…and so the battle would quickly escalate, resulting
in the Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither side wished to
launch the Endwar in advance, because the results of such a war would
be catastrophic. Even the victor would suffer terrible losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate
understands,” both Whitepole and Azurefox said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send squads
of Immortal armies to reinforce you. Since we cannot ambush them,
then let us build up our strength. Once we are fully prepared, we’ll
make our move,” the Godking instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Whitepole
and Azurefox kowtowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals were very important in Realmwars, but having vast armies of
Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals was also very important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In sufficient numbers,
they could kill even True Immortals and Empyrean Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they had
‘only’ sent out sixty-six Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
earlier was for the sake of ambushing their foes; thus, they hadn’t
sent out their armies of Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals. The
armies would cause too much of a stir; there was no way to hide such
a massive mobilization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity and the Seamless City both remained there in midair, facing
each other. Neither side called out the other for battle. A strange
peace had arrived…but this sort of peace caused every Immortal and
Fiendgod on both sides to feel as though a terrible storm was
pressing towards them. What was coming next…was the eruption of a
terrifying Realmwar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
Ji Ning was meeting the Xia Emperor by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The Xia
Emperor was seated atop his throne, flipping through a few books.
Smiling, he said, “Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down. He
couldn’t help but ask, “Imperial Majesty, the countless Immortals
of our six Heaven Punishers are feeling uneasy and nervous. When,
exactly, shall we begin our fight against the Seamless Gate? Or shall
we have a long-lasting truce? It’s best if we can give a clear
answer, so as to calm everyone’s minds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fear of the unknown was
one of the greatest of fears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. This is my
fault.” The Xia Emperor understood. “My clone has been by
Master’s side at his seat of enlightenment this entire time,
helping to make the arrangements for the various armies. I forgot
about the many Immortals within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the Xia
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Realmwar…the
twenty-six Empyrean Gods and True Immortals that arrived earlier are
all people who don’t have things tying them down, which was why
they were in the first wave. There are others who will be coming as
well. Most importantly of all, there are many Immortals coming; the
number of summoned Celestial Immortals is in excess of three hundred
thousand,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
thousand Celestial Immortals?” Ning called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing to
be surprised about. The Grand Xia alone has ten thousand Celestial
Immortals,” the Xia Emperor said. “Master is in control over
dozens of major worlds and countless minor worlds. With so many major
worlds embroiled in war, many new Celestial Immortals have been
birthed through their experiences. The Crimsonbright world which
Master himself created has a particularly high number of Celestial
Immortals. The total number of Celestial Immortals under Master’s
command has to be over a million.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A million Celestial
Immortals?” Ning couldn’t breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…that’s
in the past. Even our Grand Xia has seen three thousand Celestial
Immortals turn traitor, thanks to the blandishments of the Seamless
Gate. I imagine that in the entire Crimsonbright Realm, at least a
hundred thousand Celestial Immortals have been induced to join the
Seamless Gate. The total number of Celestial Immortals currently
under Master’s command is now probably less than a million,” the
Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before the Seamless
Gate appeared, the likes of the Youngflame clan and True Immortal
Whitepole were, on the surface at least, subordinate to Daofather
Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the storm
arrived…many lines were drawn. Daofather Crimsonbright’s forces
had indeed been weakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because many other
major worlds need to be stabilized as well, it was quite hard for
three hundred thousand Celestial Immortals to be gathered here,”
the Xia Emperor said. “If we squeezed our resources a bit more, we
might be able to summon another two hundred thousand Celestial
Immortals…but the amount of pressure that would place on the other
major worlds of the Crimsonbright Realm is too great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than three
hundred thousand Celestial Immortals, and tens of millions of Loose
Immortals.” The Xia Emperor continued, “In addition, my elder
brother, Daofather Raindragon, has sent some reinforcements as well.
Based on what our Daofathers have learned, the Seamless Gate has sent
Daofather Ink Bamboo to personally command their forces in this
Realmwar…and so Master will accompany his grand army of three
hundred thousand Celestial Immortals. He will descend upon the Grand
Xia and take personal command of this war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So this was how a war
between Immortals was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides would have
Daofather commanders and dozens of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals,
hundreds of thousands of Celestial Immortals, and tens of millions of
Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a Realmwar!”
The Xia Emperor stared at Ning. “Both sides are frantically
summoning as many soldiers and generals as they can in an attempt to
build up as much power as possible before launching the war. Once the
war stars…I truly can’t even imagine how many Immortals are going
to die. During this preparatory time period, you need to focus on
your training. Ideally, you would become a Pure Yang True Immortal.
That way, the Immortals under your command will pose a greater threat
to the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He did indeed have to
start training harder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had already
become a Pure Yang True Immortal, he hadn’t even reached the expert
level in his soul heartforce technique. Every day, he had some new
insights into the soul heartforce technique; given enough time, his
power would continue to increase until the day came for him to reach
the level of mastery in it. Upon reaching that level…Ning couldn’t
even imagine how powerful his Heaven Punisher would be. One thing was
certain; by then, the amount of natural energy absorbed by a thousand
Celestial Immortals and a hundred thousand Loose Immortals would
definitely be insufficient. He would need more Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm your mind and
enjoy this final period of peace before the great war erupts anew,”
the Xia Emperor said, looking at Ning. “Once both sides have
finished their preparations…I’m not even sure if I will survive
that war. If half of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals survive,
that would be an excellent result.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent the
following days with his wife while diligently training in his soul
heartforce technique. The full attention of both his true body and
his Primaltwin were focused on the soul heartforce technique, because
it was this technique that would allow him to reach a high level of
power as fast as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Immortals
within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity knew that these were the final
days of peace they would see. The Realmwar was coming. The mood
within the city became noticeably heavier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were constantly descending upon the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity, until finally…one day…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world of the
Grand Xia seemed to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been seated in
the lotus position with his eyes closed, focusing on the soul
heartforce technique. He immediately charged out and flew into the
skies, and right away he saw that in the air above the black Seamless
City, an utterly enormous spatial corridor had appeared. A tall,
skinny man whose unbound hair seemed to gleam with infinite darkness
stepped out from the spatial corridor, entering the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked rather
ordinary, but he radiated a halo of infinite darkness. Behind him
appeared an enormous, swaying bamboo stalk that was thirty thousand
meters tall, causing Ning and the others to feel a sense of
oppression.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, a Pure Yang True
Immortal, still felt a sense of oppression. One could only imagine
the nameless dread which Celestial Immortal Unity and the others
felt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather!” Ning
immediately recognized what this individual had to be.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Ink
Bamboo?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
titanic, swaying bamboo stalk, Ji Ning instantly guessed at who this
was. There were only so many major powers within the Three Realms. If
the man hadn’t shown off his trademark, Ning wouldn’t have been
able to tell, but since he did, it became an easy guess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From what he had
heard…Daofather Ink Bamboo was famous for being ‘unkillable’.
His true body was that of a stalk of inky-green bamboo that was
filled with boundless vitality. By relying on his special life
techniques, he had managed to survive even the great tribulation that
had destroyed the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That must be
Daofather Ink Bamboo. Just looking at him from afar makes my heart
quiver. That halo of darkness around him…I can sense that if I
touch it, I’ll definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the first
time I’ve seen a Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather who
controls a Heavenly Dao…I truly wonder how powerful Daofathers
really are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Eight
Dragons Cloudcity was filled with discussions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loose Immortals made up
the vast majority of the population within the city, after all; when
Daofather Crimsonbright had summoned his million Celestial Immortals,
the Celestial Immortals of the Crimsonbright Realm had seen him in
person, broadening their horizons. The countless Loose Immortals,
however…they truly didn’t have a chance to see Daofathers in
person. This time, however…they saw Daofather Ink Bamboo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that
Daofather Crimsonbright will descend as well, for the sake of this
Realmwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what
Daofather Crimsonbright looks like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was filled
with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three months after
Daofather Ink Bamboo descended upon the Grand Xia, Daofather
Crimsonbright descended as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On that day, the Xia
Emperor had summoned Ning and the others to respectfully await his
arrival. Even the solitary, arrogant Sword Immortal Evergreen was
behaving with complete decorum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the entire
world shook once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…an
unbelievably massive chasm appeared within the skies above them, many
tens of thousands of meters long. An azure-haired old man strode out
from within it. Taking a single step, he entered the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was the
first to call out respectfully. After he did so, Ning and the others
all bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single glance; that
was all it took for Ning to form a deep impression of Daofather
Crimsonbright in his mind. Daofather Crimsonbright was a very old,
very solemn and silent individual. Looking at him was like looking at
an ancient tree that had existed for countless ages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
swept the host with his eyes, his gaze falling upon Ning. “Subhuti’s
always had a strange disposition. He’s clearly taught an entire
host of students, but he doesn’t command them to fight with him,
instead letting them remain scattered across the Three Realms. This
young apprentice of his, Ji Ning, clearly has tremendous potential,
and Subhuti clearly cares about him deeply. And yet…Ji Ning is now
following me instead of him.” Sometimes, Daofather Crimsonbright
truly didn’t understand this old friend of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had a very
strange disposition. Or perhaps it could be said that he was
excessively detached!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He clearly had a large
group of extremely powerful disciples. If he gave the order,
Subhuti’s many disciples would flock to his banner, immediately
resulting in the creation of a force that was as powerful as the Four
Ancestors of the River Source. If Subhuti truly put all of his
resources into building up such a force, it would probably become
even more powerful than the forces of the Four Ancestors of the River
Source.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…Subhuti had
no intentions of commanding his disciples at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
didn’t understand. None of the major powers of the Three Realms
understood. The feeling which Subhuti gave many of the major powers
of the Three Realms was that of mysteriousness, and so he was
acclaimed as the most mysterious Daofather of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Daofather
Crimsonbright descended unto the Grand Xia, the massive chasm in the
skies above remained open. A throng of Immortals began to flood in
through the massive chasm in an awe-inspiring stream. The flood of
Immortals seemed endless! They flew out from the chasm, then flew
straight towards the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One great Immortal army
after another…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of armies
was far, far greater than the number which the Grand Xia itself had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wo…wow…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is really…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is
too…heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ning felt
breathless. As for the Celestial Immortal and Loose Immortal soldiers
of the Grand Xia who were on duty and unable to leave their camps,
they watched this sight breathlessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no limit to
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a flood! A
flood of Immortals and Fiendgods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to this…the
so-called celestial soldiers and celestial generals of the Celestial
Court aren’t worth a damn. I heard that the Celestial Court has
several armies with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the weakest of
whom are merely at the Primal Daoist level. Celestial Immortals are
high-ranking members of the Celestial Court, while the Celestial
Emperor himself would frantically try to befriend any Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals who appear. If this Immortal army before us went
to the Celestial Court, they would wipe it out in the blink of an
eye.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I can see
millions of Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Millions? There has
to be at least ten million.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Fiendgods as
well; there is definitely more than ten million of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers of the
Darknorth army camp and the other army camps of the Grand Xia had
their horizons broadened today. The Grand Xia, all by itself, was
comparable to the Celestial Court in power. The Realmwar before
them…Daofather Crimsonbright had summoned all of his usable forces
for it. This was the might one of the true hegemons of the Three
Realms could summon, might which vastly surpassed that of the
Celestial Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this sort of
massive scale mobilizations only occurred during truly great
tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the dark
Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, skinny
Daofather Ink Bamboo was standing atop the city walls. Behind him was
a host of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, and all of them stared
towards the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have quite a
few Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals,” Daofather Ink Bamboo
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather
Crimsonbright is just putting on a show of force for us; the number
of Immortal soldiers we have on our side isn’t lower than his.”
The three Diremonster Gods who stood closest to Daofather Ink Bamboo
were the three who had come from Mount Dragoneater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Dragoneater had
three mighty Diremonster Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The boss was the Great
Sage Who Swallows the Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was the
Great Sage Who Swallows the Seas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third was the Great
Sage Who Swallows the Skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of them had
resoundingly shocking titles. When they had first given themselves
these nicknames during the Primordial Era, it had been viewed by many
as something of a joke. These three had styled themselves in a manner
imitating that of the Seven Great Sages, who had been powerful
Empyrean Gods during the Primordial Era. By now, the seven were even
more unfathomably powerful than they had been. The three from Mount
Dragoneater had grown increasingly powerful as well, and by now there
was no one who dared to mock them for overestimating their abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them were
invincible against anyone weaker than a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second brother, we
do indeed have as many Immortals and Fiendgods as they do, but many
have yet to arrive.” The lion-headed Diremonster God Skyswallow
rubbed his mouth as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The military
strength of the Seamless Gate is still a bit weaker than the Nuwa
Alliance’s, making it harder for us to mobilize,” Daofather Ink
Bamboo said calmly. “We have to rely on our advantage in
intelligence reports in order to effectively use our forces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their intelligence
reports were very formidable, allowing them to use just thirty
percent of their military power to achieve hundred percent
effectiveness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance had formidable tools at their disposal as
well which also allowed them to discover many things. Otherwise, they
would’ve been defeated in this war for karmic luck long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we are
weaker, we’re still capable of guarding this city,” Azurefox said
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo nodded. “Even if they attack, all we have to do is
defend for now. After all of our forces arrive, we’ll give them a
real fight. Victory over a single major world usually isn’t that
important, but this is a Realmwar. All of you should understand that
you have only one path open to you; the path of victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone, including the
three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater, nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they lost, it
would be hard for them to flee and escape. Many, many Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals of the defeated side would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparatively speaking,
the victors would suffer lighter casualties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
true slaughter would occur once one side was completely routed. That
was when the most Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Don’t want to be
massacred?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then win!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiring
Immortal armies and Fiendgod armies had all gathered at the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity. Fortunately, the city spanned ten thousand
kilometers, and could also transform to become even greater in size;
naturally, everyone was able to fit inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These tens of
millions Fiendgods are enough to form into seventy-eight Pangu
War-Formations.” Daofather Crimsonbright was seated high up on his
throne, a smile on his face as he gave his orders. “They shall be
commanded by Empyrean God Fufang, Empyrean God Kindwater, Empyrean
God Willowtemple…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These twenty-six
Empyrean Gods shall each command three Fiendgod armies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
twenty-six Empyrean Gods all assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not one of them
disobeyed the Daofather’s order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-six Empyrean
Gods all immediately used cloning techniques. Empyrean Gods could
easily create multiple clones of themselves. In a real battle,
however, the fewer clones one created, the more powerful one would
be. When these twenty-six each split into three clones, they sent
each clone to command one of their three Fiendgod armies. Although
their power was weakened due to the three-way split, resulting in
weaker Fiendgod armies, they were still much more powerful than any
Void-level Fiendgod commander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, with one
Empyrean God commanding three Fiendgod army squads, each of the three
would be able to better reinforce and support the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forces that
Daofather Raindragon sent…according to what Daofather Raindragon
said, you eighteen Empyrean Gods and True Immortals shall continue to
command those eighteen Raindragon armies,” Daofather Crisonbright
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, eighteen
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals stood up to salute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the
reinforcements which Daofather Raindragon had sent. In truth,
Daofather Raindragon had only sent reinforcements due to the
relationship he had with the Xia Emperor, as well as the fact that
the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater had been pulled into
this war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The remaining
Immortal armies shall be divided up to form 326 Heaven Punishers,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said with a laugh. “The Heaven Punisher
Formation is even better suited for battle than the Crimsonbright
Formation I previously created. My 326 generals…I am entrusting you
with these Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, twelve
Empyrean Gods/True Immortals and 314 Celestial Immortals all rose to
their feet, with Ning amongst the ranks of the Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Empyrean God
golems and the other tools shall be left in the hands of Xiamang,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said. “Alright…the Seamless Gate is
completely focusing on defense for now. I imagine they will need some
time to gather all of their forces. I expect that the great war will
begin within a year. Previous commanders of the Crimsonbright
Formation need to quickly become familiarized with the Heaven
Punisher Formation. Now, all of you can leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Everyone
rose to their feet, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Xia Emperor
departed. As soon as he left the main palace, he mentally sent to
Ning, “Ji Ning, Master gave me a special order; he told me to place
an extra two thousand Celestial Immortals and two hundred thousand
Loose Immortals under your command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way, you’ll
have a total of three thousand Celestial Immortals and three hundred
thousand Loose Immortals under your command, allowing you to form
into an even more powerful Heaven Punisher,” the Xia Emperor said.
“You are perfectly suited for your role as the commander of your
Heaven Punisher; naturally, you need to be given more Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Perfect Heaven
Punisher Formation involved a commander, 9000 Celestial Immortals,
and 810,000 Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
smiled. If the Xia Emperor hadn’t raised it, Ning was planning to
do so himself. This was because Ning had made some additional
improvements in his soul heartforce technique during this temporary
ceasefire; he was now able to control 100% of the power of a Heaven
Punisher formed from merely a thousand Celestial Immortals and a
hundred thousand Loose Immortals.

Chapter 32 - War Erupts
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send the
Immortals to your army camp right away. You need to quickly
accustomize yourself to commanding three thousand Celestial Immortals
and three hundred thousand Loose Immortals. The power of your Heaven
Punisher will increase yet again; perhaps, at a critical moment in
the war, I’ll have to rely on you to save my life,” the Xia
Emperor laughed. “However, you have to be careful. The most
outstanding tree within a forest is often the first to be felled.
You’ll most likely suffer attacks from many members of the Seamless
Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ji
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ideally, you should
keep some power hidden in reserve. If you suddenly unleash it at a
critical moment in a battle, you can have a major impact on the
course of the war,” the Xia Emperor reminded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t even told
his master, Subhuti, that he had become a Pure Yang True Immortal. By
now, he had already created the twelfth stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword], a stance which encompassed the entire Dao of the Sword.
However, he had never before displayed this technique, nor had he
spoken to anyone of his improvements in soul heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed onwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine months passed in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position within a private room inside his residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pure Yang Jindan
within his body was swollen with golden light, and its luster had
become an even denser color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of ripples
were currently emanating from his Jindan, ripples caused by the
merging of his soul into it. The invisible, untouchable power known
as ‘heartforce’ was constantly sending commands to his soul. He
was meditating nonstop on the soul heartforce technique. When
meditating, he would often meet with many puzzling problems. Ning
would either ponder them alone, or compare them to the information he
had in the [Heart Sutra] in the hopes that he might be inspired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There naturally were
differences between Ning’s technique and Old Man Yuan’s
technique, but they sprang from the same foundation and had certain
similarities. This was of assistance to Ning in terms of speeding up
his meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, the
Seamless Gate is prepared for battle.” The Xia Emperor’s voice
rang out by the ears of the Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and
commanders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity was the Protocosmic spirit-treasure of the Xia Emperor; he
was able to send out these messages with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepared for
battle?” Startled, Ning immediately came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pushed open the door
to his private room, then walked out. Yu Wei gave Ning a puzzled
glance. “Why have you ended your training so quickly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The war is about to
start again,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now?” Yu
Wei’s face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
I’d be able to give birth to our child first.” Yu Wei stroked her
belly, which was very large by now. One could tell just by looking at
her that childbirth was imminent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had a very gentle
look in her eyes as she stroked her belly, a look that was filled
with motherly love. She said softly, “I can feel our baby kicking
about in my belly. It’s very likely that I’ll give birth in just
another month or two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, too, was hoping
that the war would only start after our child was born.
Unfortunately…that’s not up to me,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to take
care of yourself. Don’t push yourself too hard. We have an
absolutely massive Immortal army, while you are just one man.” Yu
Wei looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about him; even
if the seven Empyrean Gods all came out, they would most likely only
be able to have a small, localized impact on the Realmwar. The three
hundred Heaven Punishers alone were comparable to three hundred
Empyrean Gods in power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
me. I have to go now.” Ning immediately turned and walked towards
the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had a look of
worry in her eyes as she watched Ning leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Realmwar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how much
faith she had in Ning, she still felt fear in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to
survive,” Yu Wei murmured softly to herself as Ning left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DARKNORTH ARMY,
ASSEMBLE!” Ning’s voice rang out, shaking the entire Darknorth
army camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Instantly, the voices of hundreds of thousands of Immortals could be
heard as they called out their assent and started to join into
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of all the formations
that were in the airspace of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity, the utterly
massive Pangu War-Formations were the most eye-catching. Although
there were only seventy-eight Fiendgod armies, their formations took
up more than half of the available space. Next to them was a total of
324 Heaven Punishers, each one thirty thousand meters tall and clad
in nothing more than fur loincloths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around them flew the
sinuous Raindragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also many
Empyrean God golems as well as some Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
no longer focusing exclusively on defense.” Ning stood there in
midair, staring at the scene outside. The distant battlefield now
held ancient, towering Godbeasts, Fiendgods, and many powerful
golems. There were also many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals; they
looked small and unremarkable, but they absolutely could not be
underestimated. The army outside had already summoned so much natural
energy from Heaven and Earth that the distant skies had turned dim,
with dark clouds filling the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather has
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
noticed as Daofather Crimsonbright appeared in the distance.
Instantly, the massive armies that were hovering in the air above the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity became completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
swept his gaze past each and every one of them. “This,” he said
calmly, his voice carrying a terrifying desire for battle, “Is the
war between my entire Crimsonbright Realm and the Seamless Gate.
There is no way to avoid, no way to escape this battle. Our only
choice is to face it head-on! If you want to survive, then there is
only one path forward…to completely wipe out the Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Either we perish, or
the Seamless Gate perishes!” Daofather Crimsonbright now had a
terrifying look in his eyes, a look of murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the
elderly-looking Daofather Crimsonbright had a savage side to him, at
a time like this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only those who had
experienced that ancient war of the Primordial Era would truly
understand that there really was no way out of a great tribulation
like this. Even figures as powerful as the Four Ancestors of the
River Source would eventually have to choose an alliance, once the
final Endwar came. Anyone who tried to avoid the war would be
assailed and killed by both camps. Neither side would allow any True
Gods or Daofathers to stand aloof and potentially mop up the
survivors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two sides!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only one side could
survive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go forth and
conquer!” Daofather Crimsonbright finally gave the order. “Kill
them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL THEM ALL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless angry roars
shook the skies, causing the ground itself to tremble, as though the
world was about to burst apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, these
Immortals may have been as graceful as the wind and as pure as the
clouds. Now, however, they had all become as savage and berserk as
demons. In the past, they may have enjoyed limitless lifespans,
allowing them to roam about in a leisurely fashion, wandering the
Three Realms and making new friends. In the face of this storm,
however…the murderous impulses that lurked deep within the bones of
the Immortals and Fiendgods would be completely unleashed. This was a
great war of two opposing paths, of two opposing Daos; for me to
live, you had to die. This was more than just a war; it was a
struggle for survival!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive armies shot
through the skies, flying outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Seamless
Gate’s forces, they stood in perfect formation, waiting and
watching coldly as the Crimsonbright Realm’s forces came forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awesome presence of
these armies was enough to cause the Celestial Immortals and Loose
Immortals to quiver in terror. In the end, however, they were nothing
more than tiny chess pieces, just parts of a greater formation. They
had entrusted their commanders with their fates, with Ning holding
the lives and destinies of three thousand Celestial Immortals and
three hundred thousand Loose Immortals in his hands. Ning’s
personal prowess, in turn, made it so that each of his soldiers were
extremely respectful towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Heaven Punisher
after another descended, landing on the ground and causing it to
tremble violently. The Raindragons flew about around them, while the
utterly massive Fiendgod armies emanated the mightiest auras of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides faced off
against each other, both of their auras equally terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals are gathered in such frightening
numbers, even someone like myself would have to give way before
them.” Daofather Ink Bamboo stood atop the walls of the Seamless
City, a smile on his face. He sighed, “Those Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals in particular…the most powerful of them are almost
comparable to Daofathers in might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
Empyrean God in the entire history of the Three Realms was Houyi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps there were some
other monstrously talented Empyrean Gods who were able to give
Daofathers a fight and live to tell the tale, but when Houyi was an
Empyrean God…he had actually KILLED a Daofather! Of course, Houyi
eventually broke through to become a True God himself, at which point
his reputation and his power grew to an even more incredible level.
He was publicly acknowledged as the number one divine archer of the
Three Realms, and he came up with the systemized heartforce archery
technique known as [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the one and
only heartforce technique that was completely systemized, allowing
anyone to train in it. The techniques which Ning had come up with,
for example, were only suitable for himself to train in; there was no
way he could teach it to someone else, no matter how hard he tried.
Old Man Yuan, in turn, had simply provided Ning with the sum of his
own personal experiences, allowing Ning to benefit from them in
coming up with his own ideas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, this great
divinity Houyi, who had caused the entire Three Realms to quiver in
terror during the Primordial Era, had completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonbright?”
Daofather Ink Bamboo stared into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
stood there atop the distant walls of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,
staring towards the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two Daofathers
stared at each other from afar. As their gazes met, it was as though
a streak of black light had suddenly clashed against a streak of
azure light, causing space itself to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonbright, long
time no see!” Daofather Ink Bamboo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed, long time no
see. Only…it would be better if you died and I never saw you
again,” Daofather Crimsonbright said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on their side,
be it Subhuti or Crimsonbright, felt nothing more than the utmost of
enmity towards the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of enmity had
existed from the eareliest of days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Subhuti,
Crimsonbright, and the others were so utterly enraged that Old Man
Yuan was just watching without choosing a side. As Subhuti and the
others saw it, he shouldn’t have even hesitated to stand with the
Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? Die? Haha…I,
Ink Bamboo, specialize in staying alive. During those bygone years,
when I followed his Majesty, we nearly wiped you out.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo sighed. “Alas…in the end, Nuwa actually broke through
to Pangu’s level. Otherwise, you would’ve been doomed. Now, the
storm has risen once again…and this time, you won’t be able to
escape it. You True Gods, you Daofathers…all of you will die. None
of you will survive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite arrogant of
you. Back then, the Primordial World was shattered, Mother Nuwa made
her breakthrough, the Lord of All Things was slain, and even your
‘king’ was forced to merge himself into the Heavenly Daos and
transform himself into part of them to survive. Even if he’s
awakened…so what? He’s still merely a part of the Heavenly Daos,
restricted and bound by them at all times, unable to be truly free.”
Daofather Crimsonbright laughed coldly, “He’s no longer the king
he once was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Majesty remains
his Majesty.” Daofather Ink Bamboo smirked. “Now that the storm
his arisen, I trust that you can subconsciously sense the way in
which the river of destiny is flowing…and that you understand that
there is no way to avoid this storm. His Majesty will move in concert
with the Dao of the Heavens in aiding our Seamless Gate in wiping you
all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wiping us out is the
will of the Dao of the Heavens?” Daofather Crimsonbright laughed
coldly. “What a joke. If the Dao of the Heavens wished for us to
perish, then why engage in a battle for karmic luck?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
was startled. He then shook his head, no longer saying anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Daofather
Crimsonbright felt regret…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
still able to maintain some degree of contact with their ancient
king, and so they knew many secrets. Daofather Crimsonbright wished
to suss out some of their secrets, but alas, the Seamless Gate was
very cautious, only revealing information which the Nuwa Alliance
already knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One thing was for
certain; the Nuwa Alliance was going to fight for every scrap of
karmic luck they could! Afterwards, they would wipe out the Seamless
Gate in the Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient, slumbering
king of the Seamless Gate was very terrifying, but in the end he was
now nothing more than a part of the Dao of the Heavens. All things
within the Three Realms were ruled by the Dao of the Heavens; one
couldn’t simply do whatever one wished! This was the reason why the
Nuwa Alliance felt absolutely certain that it would win. If that old
bastard could do as he pleased, the Nuwa Alliance would’ve lost
long ago; Mother Nuwa herself had left the Three Realms, after all,
having gone exploring the infinite primordial chaos around it. With
her gone, no one was strong enough to face that presence head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight for more
karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Win this war for
karmic luck, no matter what the cost. The more karmic luck we have,
the more the Dao of the Heavens will support us. That old bastard is
being restricted by the Dao of the Heavens, and so the amount of aid
he can provide the Seamless Gate will be lessened as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
swept the vast enemy army with his gaze. These countless Immortals
and Fiendgods were all here for the sake of karmic luck. Only by
winning this war could the countless geniuses of the world, such as
Ji Ning, be able to survive this great storm…because they had
chosen to stand with the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they lost their
karmic luck, and if even the Dao of the Heavens stood on the side of
the Seamless Gate…it was likely that they would lose the final
Endwar, at which point Ji Ning and the countless Immortals and
Fiendgods would all be wiped out and exterminated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Daofather
Crimsonbright’s voice rang out by the ears of Ji Ning and every
single commander. Ning and the others all felt their blood begin to
surge and boil. Their eyes instantly turned red with battle-lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
awe-inspiring armies began to charge forward. More than three hundred
Heaven Punishers bound forward on bare feet, charging towards their
foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the great armies
of the Seamless Gate, they too let out an earth-shaking howl: “Kill!”
They too charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgods…Terrorbeasts…awe-inspiringly
large armies…the world was filled with them. It was like two giant
floods of power had jsust crashed into each other.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 33 - Death Is But A Statistic
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bare feet of Ji
Ning’s Heaven Punisher pounded against the ground as it charged
forward. Ning lead the charge, the other Heaven Punishers by his
side. More than three hundred of them were charging forward against
the forces of the Seamless Gate, including many Empyrean God golems,
White-Faced Flood Dragons, Zhuyan Apes, and other types of
Terrorbeasts and Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two armies collided
against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite charging
forward, Ning’s Heaven Punisher continued to move at the speed the
other Heaven Punishers were moving at. Although there were twelve
Empyrean God or True Immortal commanders amongst the 326 Heaven
Punishers, neither they nor Ning moved beyond the pack. Once the two
armies collided, however, Ning and the twelve all exploded with full
power, their speed and their strength increasing dramatically!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That one is Ji
Ning’s Heaven Punisher.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Gate were naturally able to recognize Ning, but there was no
way for them to avoid him on this vast field of battle; the only
choice was to take him on! A Zhuyan Ape, completely covered with
white fur and with red feet, bellowed and charged forward with a
similarly ferocious aura of power, pushing past the other
Terrorbeasts and becoming the first to bar Ning’s path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he dares to block
me, he must have at least a bit of power behind him. This is most
likely a Zhuyan Formation commanded by an Empyrean God or a True
Immortal. This is the first clash in the Realmwar, with both sides
striking each other head-on; such a chaotic battle is the perfect
chance to render military merits!” A savage light flashed through
Ning’s eyes, and the top-grade Pure Yang ‘Splitter’ in his
hands instantly transformed into an utterly massive shield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The headless Heaven
Punisher held the shield in its two mighty arms and continued to
smash forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The burly Zhuyan Ape
was shocked. “How sly of Ji Ning! I am a Pure Yang True Immortal
with many marvelous spells; in skill and technique, I’m naturally
vastly superior to him. Although I’ve heard that Ji Ning’s Heaven
Punisher is very powerful, if he was to use sword-arts, I trust I
could tie him down for at least a short period of time. If I can do
that, the other members of the Seamless Gate will have arrived to
assist me. But he instead chooses to ram forward with a shield; my
only option is to take him head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…even if we
are competing in raw strength, I’m in command of 1800 Celestial
Immortals and many Loose Immortals. I don’t believe I can’t beat
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhuyan Apes were
incomparably savage and strong as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAAAR!” The
Zhuyan picked up a shield and also charged straight forward towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two great figures,
each holding a giant shield, rammed straight towards each other,
their footsteps causing the earth to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!! The two shields
collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! How can he be
so strong? He’s even stronger than Azurefox and Whitefox claimed
him to be!” The Zhuyan Ape felt a terrifying, irresistible surge of
energy push straight towards him. He was knocked flying away,
completely unable to control himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectators,
however, only saw that as soon as Ning and the Zhuyan Ape collided,
the Zhuyan was immediately knocked backwards, causing the other
Zhuyan Apes behind it to hurriedly clear a path to avoid being hit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the year-long
ceasefire, Ning had improved greatly in his soul heartforce
technique. In this exchange, however, Ning still concealed his true
power and true level of improvement. The simple fact that he now had
three times as many Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals resulted
in his Heaven Punisher instantly and automatically becoming much more
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t the
time for me to unleash my full power yet. I need to find a turning
point, a turning point capable of influencing the entire war.”
Massive shield in hands, Ning immediately threw himself towards a
second Zhuyan Ape after having knocked the first one flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here,
quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second Zhuyan Ape
was panicking. In truth, a Pure Yang True Immortal was already flying
towards them, preparing to cast a spell. A dazzling golden light
suddenly appeared in the skies, shining down upon Ning’s Heaven
Punisher. This sort of constrictive spell, however, was almost
negligible to something as powerful as Ning’s Heaven Punisher. Most
likely, only ten Pure Yang True Immortals casting the same type of
spell simultaneously would be enough to tie Ning down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s fight
together!” Five more nearby Zhuyan Apes charged forward in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…despite being
slowed down slightly by the spell, Ning was still able to bound
forward far more quickly than the five were. He soon arrived next to
the fleeing Zhuyan Ape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the terrified
Zhuyan Ape wanted to block, the difference in power between him and
Ning was far, far too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher leapt forward, his right hand chopping downwards as
sword-light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A simian head went
flying, and the white-furred Zhuyan Ape completely disintegrated,
revealing the utterly terrified Immortals that had been inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A palm-leaf fan
appeared within Ning’s hands. Ning swung it towards the many
fleeing Immortals, some of whom were using evasive techniques while
others were hiding within Immortal estates. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Countless Immortal estates were instantly disintegrated, with only a
very small number of extremely powerful Immortal estates being able
to safely withstand the power of Ning’s palm-leaf fan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, the Yin-Yang
Arcane Ki Bottle appeared before Ning as well. The bottle began to
ravenously devour all of the surving estates, swallowing all of them
and the Immortals inside them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this war, they had
to wipe out all living creatures on the enemy’s side!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he merely destroyed
the Zhuyan Ape and allowed the majority of the Immortals to escape,
they would quickly be used to form yet another army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were now a total
of eight Zhuyan Apes surrounding Ning, as well as two Pure Yang True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, in a battle
like this, both sides would quickly end up in a deadlocked quagmire.
Only at the very beginning would there be a tiny chance to achieve a
quick victory, and Ning used that chance to completely destroy that
Zhuyan Ape! Only a few dozen Celestial Immortals with exceptionally
astonishing evasive techniques had been able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning,
all by himself, wildly assaulted those eight Zhuyan Apes. Even after
having joined forces together, the eight were still being utterly
dominated and outclassed. Fortunately, they had two Pure Yang True
Immortals supporting them, allowing them to just barely hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, we’re
coming!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice kill,
Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the Heaven
Punishers of Celestial Immortal Unity, Celestial Immortal Dustfloat,
and a few others came charging from behind to help Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
White-Faced Flood Dragons of the Seamless Gate were drawing near as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s combat region
became a fairly densely populated battlefield. Almost a tenth of the
full power of each side was concentrated within this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s Ji Ning?
The Godking seems to pay a great deal of attention to him.” The
three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater were quite accustomed to
battlefields. They had already transformed into their true
Diremonster forms. Of the three, the eldest brother known as the
‘Great Sage Who Swallows The Mountains’ was actually a
gold-feathered eagle. His wings allowed him to move as fast as a
streak of lightning; in terms of speed, this ‘Great Sage Who
Swallows The Mountains’ was the fastest one on this field of
battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second brother, the
Great Sage Who Swallows The Seas, was an ugly dragon that had broken
horns and a completely pitch-black body. He swam through the
battlefield, his claws striking out with such power that space itself
shattered apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third brother, the
Great Sage Who Swallows The Skies, was a nine-headed lion that was as
massive and majestic as a mountain. Every step he took caused the
world to shudder with a strange, inexplicable cadence. Even when the
Pangu War-Formations on the side of the Crimsonbright Realm collided
head-on against the nine-headed lion, they would be knocked backwards
by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even True Immortal Whitepole, when going all out, was just
barely strong enough to tie down a Pangu War-Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of these three
Diremonster Gods possessed overwhelming power, so mighty that it
could be said that not a single Empyrean God or True Immortal of the
Crimsonbright Realm could compare to them on this field of battle. In
turn, none of the Empyrean Gods or True Immortals of the Seamless
Gate who were taking part in this battle could compare to them
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their fame had long
since spread throughout the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give that Ji
Ning a test.” The gold-feathered eagle, the Great Sage Who Swallows
The Mountains, let out a loud laugh, then gave his wings a flap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but that one
motion, he threw himself straight towards Ning like a streak of
light, moving at an utterly astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let him run
off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
six Empyrean Gods/True Immortals on a ship of pure light, with the
Xia Emperor one of them. These six were riding on a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, the Worldspan Lightship. It was only thanks to the
speed of this ship that they were able to keep up with the
gold-feathered eagle. Of the three Diremonster Gods, the eldest
wasn’t actually the strongest, but he was definitely the fastest.
If he was allowed to run about as he pleased on the battlefield, with
no one tying him down…he would be incredibly deadly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the
responsibility of the Xia Emperor and the rest of the six was to keep
an eye on him and tie him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chasing me?” The
gold-feathered eagle let out a snicker, making sudden and unexpected
left and right turns as he moved through the field of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When moving in straight
lines, the Worldspan Lightship was actually slightly faster than the
gold-feathered eagle…but in terms of agility, it couldn’t
compare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re coming as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoever kills Ji
Ning will have won a great victory. His bounty is worth more than the
bounty of twenty ordinary Heaven Punishers!” The other two
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater all immediately charged towards
Ning as well. When they attacked, certain forces of the Crimsonbright
Realm were forced to give chase. Multiple Raindragons and Pangu
War-Formations frantically attacked them, but the two were still able
to force their way towards Ji Ning’s direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-feathered
eagle quickly reached Ning’s location, and it charged straight
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
currently battling others, he was still keeping an eye on his
surroundings. His side had managed to kill some foes, but the
Seamless Gate had killed some of them as well. The six Diremonster
Gods of Mount Tonglian were particularly deadly; after they joined
together into the ‘Six Unities Formation’, the six of them were
able to support each other and sweep through their foes with power
far greater than each of them could individually muster. The combined
strikes of these six Diremonster Gods had slain two Heaven Punishers
and destroyed a Pangu War-Formation. In the end, it had taken three
full Raindragons to tie them down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on Ning’s side were similarly
extraordinary, also gaining many victories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This initial clash had
already resulted in countless casualties for both sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While watching the
overall battlefield, Ning suddenly saw from the corner of his eyes a
flashing golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…? Ah, the
eldest brother of the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater?”
When Ning saw the massive, terrifyingly fast gold-feathered eagle fly
towards him, he was instantly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly
growing cautious, Ning’s weapons instantly transformed into two
shields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die for me, puny
human.” The gold-feathered eagle pounced upon Ning, its sharp
talons gouging towards him like terrifyingly sharp hooks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
on the ground, not moving to dodge at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that the
attacks of the gold-feathered eagle reached him, Ning brandished the
shields in his arms. Boom! They struck head-on against the sharp
claws of the gold-feathered eagle. Now that he was commanding three
times as many Immortals, his Heaven Punisher was faster than it had
been in the past, especially its arms, which were both dexterous and
strong. Given that the shields he was using were quite large, he was
able to completely block this strange, profound, terrifying claw
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-feathered
eagle was actually sent spinning backwards through the skies, only
coming to a halt a few moments later. This instantly caused the
always arrogant and brash Diremonster God, the Great Sage Who
Swallows The Mountains, to feel completely humiliated and enraged.
“Second brother, third brother, get over here! This Ji Ning guy is
tremendously strong!”

Chapter 34 - Lying Hidden
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming! Big brother,
let me give him a try.” The nine-headed lion was like mobile
mountain range, smashing straight through all opposition and pushing
aside the Pangu War-Formations, Raindragons, and Heaven Punishers in
his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the second
brother of the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater, that ugly
dragon with snapped horns, was actually more agile than the other
three, it clearly found it rather difficult to traverse the
battlefield. It wasn’t as fast as the clumsy-looking nine-headed
lion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning could sense
space around him shudder. He glanced sideways, instantly seeing the
nine-headed lion charge straight towards him. He couldn’t help but
feel shocked: “Him? The most powerful of the three Diremonster
Gods…the nine-headed lion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine-headed lions were
Godbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the only one of
the three who had a truly exalted bloodline, one which was comparable
to that of nine-tailed foxes and Five Elements peacocks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was normally quite
low-key and unobstrusive, but in actual power it was the strongest of
the three. The nine-headed lion was ranked amongst the very top
experts in the entire Three Realms, comparable to the likes of Lu
Dongbin. But of course, Lu Dongbin was a Ki Refiner, whereas the
nine-headed lion was both a Ki Refiner and a Fiendgod Body Refiner,
resulting in Lu Dongbin being at an innate disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that his
strength is comparable to Patriarch Lu’s.” Ning didn’t dare to
be overconfident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect timing,
third brother!” The airborne gold-feathered eagle was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine-headed lion
was bounding across the ground towards Ning, all of the Fiendgods and
Terrorbeasts of the Seamless Gate parting before it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held those two
shields in his hands, not dodging in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see how
powerful someone who supposedly stands at the very top tier of power
amongst Empyrean Gods and True Immortals is.” Ning’s heart was
filled with a desire to do battle. The nine-headed lion…Empyrean
God Redsnow…Patriarch Lu…all of them stood at the very peak of
power for Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. Each of them were very
close to True Gods and Daofathers in power. However, Ning would never
have a chance to test his Heaven Punisher out in power against
Patriarch Lu and Empyrean god Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, Ning’s
true body was within the underwater estate, and had sparred with
Empyrean God Redsnow before. However…Redsnow, as the leader of the
seven Empyrean Gods, had been praised by even Subhuti himself as
someone who was just a hairs-breadth away from the Daofather level of
power. When Ning’s true body had dueled Redsnow, Ning had lost
catastrophically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this field of
battle, however, Ning’s Primaltwin had the power of a Pure Yang
True Immortal and the power of the Heaven Punisher Formation
supporting him. Ning absolutely wasn’t afraid of giving him a
fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground quivered as
the nine-headed lion charged towards Ning, and as Ning leaped forward
towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A savage
light flashed through the eyes of the nine-headed lion. It lowered
its heads, a layer of golden light emerging from them and covering
its entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hunkered
downwards, the two shields in his hands as he rammed straight
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were
fighting head-on against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine-headed lions were
Godbeasts that were famous for their strength, and this Great Sage
Who Devours the Skies had a particularly deep level of insight into
the Dao, making him even more incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s strength
didn’t need to be described; on the battlefield, he had ravaged the
many experts of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine-headed lion
felt an flood of power sweep through it. There was no skill, no
tricks to it; it was a surge of absolutely incredible raw power,
causing it to stumble backwards uncontrollably. The nine-headed lion
had no time to feel stunned; it hurriedly used an evasive technique,
causing the surrounding space to become illusory as it retreated by a
thousand kilometers in a manner that displayed no openings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
felt a strange, powerful vibration transmitted towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t just pure,
raw power; it was a type of vibration. The sort of vibration one
might feel when an earthquake hit, a vibration that couldn’t simply
be blocked or deflected. Ning immediately understood. No wonder all
of the armies on their side, be it the Pangu War-Formations, the
Raindragons, or the Heaven Punishers, were knocked backwards! In
addition, the nine-headed lion’s headlong charge didn’t seem to
have consumed much power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was actually a
type of profound, high level technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning’s
Heaven Punisher possessed nigh-infinite strength, it still couldn’t
help but take three steps back before the vibrating power dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is
strong!” The distant nine-headed lion laughed loudly, his laughter
echoing throughout the battlefield. “Come, again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think I’m
afraid of you?” Ning’s Heaven Punisher once more charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the
nine-headed lion clashed repeatedly on the field of battle. Each
time, Ning only took three steps back. While the nine-headed lion had
a profound grasp over the Dao, with each step on the ground seeming
to cause the ground to twist and space to distort, the difference in
raw power was simply too great. Each time, the nine-headed lion would
still be forced to dodge backwards by a thousand kilometers..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, if
the three of us join together to form the Three-Eyed God, would we be
able to kill this Ji Ning?” The airborne gold-feathered eagle,
still being harried by the Xia Emperor and the others, sent a mental
message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, big
brother and I are waiting for you to give the word.” The dragon
with the shattered horns was flying around the area as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods were capable of setting up a formation to form a Three-Eyed God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed God was
primarily led by the most powerful of the three brothers, the
nine-headed lion. It was very similar to the Seven Planets God, which
was formed by the seven Empyrean Gods of the Starseizing Manor but
primarily led by Redsnow. Redsnow and the nine-headed lion had the
highest level of insights into the Dao in their respective squads,
and they were the strongest in battle as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not certain,”
the nine-headed lion sent mentally. “This Ji Ning is very skilled
in commanding his Heaven Punisher, and his strength is too
incredible. Even if we join forces together into the Three-Eyed
God…in a one-on-one fight, we’d naturally able to kill him, but a
large number of experts of the Crimsonbright Realm are nearby.
They’ll frantically assail us, which means we’ll have a very low
chance of killing him, less than thirty percent at most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Both the
gold-feathered eagle and the broken-horn dragon understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. The
Crimsonbright Realm had sent a total of six Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to tie down the gold-feathered eagle, which was the fastest
of the three. There were other experts who had been assigned to deal
with the broken-horn dragon and the nine-headed lion. As soon as they
joined into the Three-Eyed God, the many experts would naturally join
forces with Ji Ning against it, giving it less than a thirty percent
chance of killing Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
nine-headed lion.” Ning was stunned by their exchange as well.
“It’s actually only at a slight disadvantage in a one-on-one
fight against me. I’m a Pure Yang True Immortal, and I’m
commanding three thousand Celestial Immortals and three hundred
thousand Loose Immortals. He’s too powerful! If the intelligence
reports are correct and they really can join together into a
Three-Eyed God, how powerful would that be?! One-on-one, I’d
probably be killed quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the three
Diremonster Gods were here, a large number of experts of the
Crimsonbright Realm had hurried here as well. There were five
Raindragons and six Heaven Punishers that were commanded by Empyrean
Gods or True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how much of a
threat the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater posed to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Seamless City. Daofather Ink Bamboo watched the battle for quite some
time. Both sides had suffered significant losses, but they continued
to battle wildly. The Daofather gave the order: “Pull back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed in the
minds of every Seamless Gate commander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pull back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate
quickly joined together to begin an orderly, step-by-step retreat
back to their camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
was watching this from atop the Eight Dragons Cloudcity. Frowning, he
gave the order as well: “Pull back and rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, how did it
go? How were our losses, compared to the losses of the Seamless
Gate?” Celestial Immortals Unity, Whacko, Dustfloat, Allbeasts, and
Rainsoar had gathered together with Ning. The six had battled
together for many years and were very close to each other; they were
a tight-knit squad which advanced and retreated in unison on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. On the
battlefield, we didn’t have any spare energy to watch the others,”
Celestial Immortal Dustfloat added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed. “Both
sides suffered sigifnicant losses, roughly ten thousand Celestial
Immortals each. I’m not sure of the exact numbers. The Xia Emperor
should know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost that many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not bad;
the Seamless Gate has many more golems than us. For us to match them
in casualties isn’t bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was just our
first engagement. The Realmwar is going to be crazy…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all let out sighs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, this had
merely been a war for the Grand Xia. Now, it was a Realmwar. It must
be understood that the Xia Emperor had only commanded a total of ten
thousand Celestial Immortals, and despite so many years of battle,
more than half remained alive. But today…ten thousand had died in a
single engagement!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battle. Rest. Battle
again a while later. Rest again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This became the cadence
of the Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battling for too long
would result in one’s magic energy and divine power being drained.
If they were forced to fight nonstop, they would have to eat Immortal
pills to replenish their energy, which neither side was particularly
willing to do. Thus, after fighting for a while, they would withdraw
their forces to rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the surface, each
clash was simple and didn’t result in heavy losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides, however,
were searching for an opportunity…and once they found it, the
seemingly morasse of a battle would instantly explode. When that
happened, large numbers of Celestial Immortals would perish, and even
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would fall. It must be understood
that despite having clashed three times, not a single Empyrean God or
True Immortal had fallen yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even when a Pangu
War-Formation was destroyed, the commanding Empyrean God had easily
escaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since neither Empyrean
Gods nor True Immortals had perished, the war clearly had yet to
reach the critical point yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast world
of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was seated
upon his towering throne, levitating high in the air and staring down
at the masses from his position in the center of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.” A figure
was kneeling before the throne.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Realmwar has
seen three clashes thus far. Daofather Ink Bamboo has essentially
finished calculating the Crimsonbright Realm’s power, as well as
some of their hidden forces. It’s time for a fatal attack.” The
Godking looked down towards the kneeling figure. “You’ve been
hiding by Daofather Crimsonbright’s side for so long…it’s time
for you to unleash your power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate has
been awaiting this day for a long, long time,” the kneeling figure
said respectfully, his voice filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After this battle,
your status will have been exposed, and you will no longer be able to
remain with the Nuwa Alliance. Come straight to the Seamless Gate.
You are the key to this battle; don’t disappoint me,” the Godking
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kneeling figure
said, “Your subordinate has been waiting and hiding for countless
years for this moment! Everything I’ve endured…all the lies…it
was so that I could explode forth at this moment. Even if I die, I
won’t disappoint you, Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Of my many
minions, you’ve always been the most dazzling one. After you return
to the Seamless Gate, I’ll personally accept you as my disciple and
give you the three Protocosmic spirit-treasures of the ‘Vacant
Sword Formation’,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the words
‘Vacant Sword Formation’, the kneeling figure instantly grew
excited. Raising his head, he said resolutely, “Godking, just watch
and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The upraised face…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was that of Sword
Immortal Evergreen!

Chapter 35 - Evergreen Reveals Himself!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity. The main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
sat on the throne. Below him sat a host of Empyrean Gods, True
Immortals, and Celestial Immortal commanders, Ji Ning amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both Daofather Ink
Bamboo and myself have been keeping an eye on our respective armies.”
Daofather Crimsonbright looked downwards upon his subjects. “We are
both trying to suss out the true strength of each other’s forces,
find a weakness, then launch a fatal attack! The Seamless Gate’s
greatest advantage lies in its intelligence network, making it much
easier for them to investigate us. Based on the multiple Realmwars
which have occurred within the Three Realms…the Seamless Gate often
launches a fatal attack first. Thus, I have to warn you…the more
battles that occur, the greater the chances that the Seamless Gate
will launch an all-out fatal attack on the next one. You have to be
vigilant at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The Xia
Emperor said worriedly, “To always be vigilant isn’t a winning
solution…when will we lauch our own all-out attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
nodded. “I understand what you are saying, of course. However…I
can dimly sense that the Seamless Gate has another force that is
lying in wait. I have to hold some of my forces in abeyance to deal
with it. Otherwise…if we launch our all-out attack, we might end up
being tricked and countered by the Seamless Gate, resulting in a
great loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone, Ji Ning
included, nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing for
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whenever there was a
significant disparity in intelligence, the only choice was to allow
the enemy to strike first. Perhaps one might suffer a bit for it, but
they would still be able to deal with the forces they saw. If they
revealed all of their trump cards at once in an attack…their fate
would be completely up to luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one thing
we can be certain of.” Daofather Crimsonbright looked at Ning. “Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather,” Ning
replied respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
looked at Ning. “You have a talent for commanding Heaven Punishers.
Once you breakthrough to become a Pure Yang True Immortal, the power
of your Heaven Punisher shall explode to a new level. Thus, the
Seamless Gate is definitely going to try and kill you to avoid future
problems! The intelligence we’ve obtained regarding them concurs;
they’ve wanted to get rid of you this entire time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During each of the
past three battles, the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater
have been in your surrounding area,” Daofather Crimsonbright said.
“This has resulted in much of both side’s forces being
concentrated around you, roughly 30% or so of the entire battlefield.
Minor battles are going on in other places; the only place where both
sides are concentrating their forces is the area around you. Once an
all-out attack is launched, that place will be the most dangerous
place on the entire battlefield…and the first target they will want
to eliminate is you, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
looked towards the Xia Emperor. “Stay next to him and assist him.
You have to protect Ji Ning; be wary of any sudden changes in the
battlefield.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,” the
Xia Emperor said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you need
to keep an eye out as well. Even if the other minor battlefields take
a turn for the worse, casualties will be limited. The region around
Ji Ning and Xiamang, however…once there are casualties there, the
casualties will be heavy, so heavy as to potentially change the
entire dynamic. You need to keep an eye out and be prepared to deal
with anything on the fly,” Daofather Crimsonbright instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
nodded. “Alright. You can go back and rest now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the hundreds
of Immortals and Fiendgods present all walked out of the main palace.
Only after exiting did they start to discuss matters in small groups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, if you can
just keep those three from Mount Dragoneater tied down, you’ll have
rendered a major contribution,” the Xia Emperor said, walking
alongside Ning. “Don’t be in a rush to try and kill enemies; keep
an eye out for those three at all times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Darknorth, if
you are defeated, we’ll have lost a powerful military unit. For you
right now, not screwing up is already a contribution.” A bald old
man in loose robes next to them chuckled while fanning himself with a
fan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, you are
our main defense against those three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals spoke out. They were all responsible for tying
down those three Diremonster Gods, and so during the three clashes of
this Realmwar, they had been by Ji Ning’s side. To be honest, it
was rather strange; those three Diremonster Gods were always close to
Ning. The main reason for this was that the Godking viewed Ning as an
extremely important target, believing that if Ning suddenly broke
through to the Pure Yang True Immortal level, his Heaven Punisher
would instantly rise to a level of power where it would be no weaker
than the combined power of those three Diremonster Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be honest, with
Ji Ning around, it makes things easier for us. His Heaven Punisher is
so strong, not even those three Diremonster Gods can suppress him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is indeed
formidable as a Heaven Punisher commander. If he becomes a Pure Yang
True Immortal…how powerful would he become?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals continued to chat with Ning and amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, someone
walked past them. It was Sword Immortal Evergreen, who gave them a
sideways glance and a cold snort. “All of you are quite smug,
aren’t you? Don’t forget…if Ji Ning dies in battle, the entire
situation will become quite ugly for us. As I see it…you need to
focus on what you will do in the event that Ji Ning dies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
words, Sword Immortal Evergreen walked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned upon
hearing these words. On the surface, Sword Immortal Evergreen was
reminding them to be careful…but he kept on saying ‘Ji Ning
dies’, ‘Ji Ning dies’…anyone would feel displeased upon
hearing someone say such things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, don’t
mind him.” The Xia Emperor glanced at Sword Immortal Evergreen,
frowning at him before turning to smile at Ning. “That’s just how
junior apprentice-brother Evergreen is. Still…he’s not wrong to
remind us that we need to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth.” After Sword Immortal Evergreen walked away, a delicate,
white-robed female Immortal who had heard his words walked towards
Ning and hurriedly said, “Senior apprentice-brother Evergreen is
always like that. Please don’t mind him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. “A minor
matter, fellow Daoist Snowdance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Snowdance smiled
towards Ning, then followed Sword Immortal Evergreen in leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked the nearby
Xia Emperor, “What is the exact relationship between Fairy
Snowdance and Sword Immortal Evergreen? I often see them together,
and even on the field of battle, they are an inseparable duo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Snowdance is devoted to junior apprentice-brother
Evergreen, but he is excessively solitary and aloof; he’s
completely unreceptive to her advances. She, however, continues to
quietly watch over him. Although the two haven’t joined together to
become Dao-companions, Evergreen is indeed closer to Snowdance than
to any of our other fellow disciples. Still…in the end, he always
treats her in an icy manner. Junior apprentice-sister Snowdance
really is blinded,” a barbaric-looking man said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen’s simply
too sharp. His heart is like a sword, and he acts like a sword in
dealing with both people and business. He’s let her wait for him
for so long…alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals chatted amongst themselves for a bit, then
all departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few days later, the
Xia Emperor sent the mental order for his army to assemble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful. You said
it yourself; the Seamless Gate is trying to kill you if at all
possible. Our child is soon to be born; I don’t want our child to
never have the chance to meet you,” Yu Wei warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
senior apprentice-sister; the Seamless Gate is far from being able to
kill me,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the start of the
Realmwar, before each clash Yu Wei would give Ning many warnings to
be careful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m off.” Ning
smiled, then transformed into a streak of light and flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei rubbed her
stomach, watching as Ning flew away. She could sense that their child
was most likely going to enter the world in around half a month…but
why was it that she was feeling increasingly nervous?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, awe-inspiring
army had assembled, then flown out from the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
The wilderness outside the city had long been transformed into a
desolate, crater-ridden wasteland. The two opposing armies once more
charged against each other, and everything was as it had been in the
past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soldiers against
soldiers. Generals against generals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were now
experienced with each other. The heaviest casualties had come in the
first clash, while the following clashes had seen much fewer deaths.
In this clash, the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater once
more had their sights set on Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the opportunity
arises, you have to kill this Ji Ning. The most important mission you
have in this Realmwar is to kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the
instructions which both Daofather Ink Bamboo and the Godking had
given them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were evenly
matched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, those six Heaven Punishers are in danger; let’s
go help them.” Sword Immortal Evergreen and Fairy Snowdance were
flying through the sky. Sword Immortal Evergreen scanned the field of
battle, then sent a mental message to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Snowdance glanced
over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far from from, within
the region where Ning and the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater were, six Heaven Punishers were being assaulted by three
White-Faced Flood Dragons, with one of them apparently being
commanded by an Empyrean God or True Immortal. They were clearly
superior to the six Heaven Punishers in power, but the Heaven
Punishers weren’t in any real danger yet; by joining forces, they
were able to stave off defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…Fairy Snowdance
didn’t refuse. “Fine, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately flew
down to the battlefield, beginning to cast spells and use their magic
treasures to support those six Heaven Punishers. With their help, the
six instantly found the battle much easier, and in fact they were
even able to seize the advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, be careful; this region is the most dangerous
region in the entire battlefield,” Fairy Snowdance sent mentally.
“Both sides have sent more than twenty Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to this place, and we have over fifty Heaven Punishers
here, as well as Raindragons and Pangu War-Formations…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Evergreen said confidently. “We just need to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Fairy
Snowdance was just giving him a reminder; thus far, not a single
Empyrean God or True Immortal had died in this Realmwar. As long as
there wasn’t a sudden change in events, it wasn’t likely that one
of them would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen continued to cast spells to help the Heaven Punishers below
while keeping a careful eye on the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, one of
the six Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on his ship of light,
noticed that Sword Immortal Evergreen and Fairy Snowdance had arrived
as well. It must be understood that the Xia Emperor was controlling
the local formation; he naturally saw everything that happened on the
battlefield, and he generally would arrange for the disposition of
their forces. He immediately sent mentally, “Junior
apprentice-brother Evergreen, junior apprentice-sister Snowdance, go
and help out those five Heaven Punishers to your left; they are in
serious danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen and Fairy Snowdance immediately noticed it as
well. Those five were indeed suffering a group attack, and there were
no other Empyrean Gods or True Immortals nearby, aside from the two
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flew in that
direction while casting their spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Fairy
Snowdance pointed, and instantly a snowy-white lance pierced through
the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a streak of
sword-light flashed past her. Blood splattered everywhere, and as the
blood splattered on the snowy white lance of light, it was instantly
frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Snowdance stared
at her chest uncomprehendingly. A sword had pierced straight through
it, cutting quite cleanly through her Pure Yang Jindan. She raised
her head to look towards Sword Immortal Evergreen in disbelief.
“Senior, senior apprentice-brother…” In her heart, there was
one thing she wanted to say: “If you want to join the Seamless
Gate, I’m willing to join you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Snowdance
revealed a hint of a smile…the smile of release.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick. Sword Immortal
Evergreen pulled his sword out, and as his sword-ki trembled…her
entire body was instantly turned into dust, her treasures left for
Sword Immortal Evergreen to pick up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Sword
Immortal Evergreen felt a certain dull pain. “If you spend years
raising a dog, you’ll feel pain when it dies.” Sword Immortal
Evergreen immediately wiped away the tiny bit of pity he felt in his
heart, then looked downwards. He charged straight downwards, charging
towards those five Heaven Punishers. Not only did not he not support
them, he launched an assault that caused those five to feel utterly
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EVERGREEN!” The
distant Xia Emperor saw this happen. Upon seeing Fairy Snowdance’s
chest be pierced, his eyes widened so much they threatened to split
apart. He let out an utterly enraged roar that caused the heavens
themselves to tremble!
</P>

Chapter 36 - The War Changes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen paid no attention to the Xia Emperor’s furious roar at
all. His eyes flashed with red light; clearly, he had gone berserk.
“I, Evergreen, have waited for so many years…and this day shall
be my most glorious, most dazzling moment.” He fully released all
of his hidden power, and the Immortal swords he controlled
transformed into three streaks of azure-black sword-light that
pierced through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Evergreen…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Traitor!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Heaven
Punishers felt completely despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were already in a
dangerous situation, having suffered a group assault by the forces of
the Seamless Gate; that was the reason why the Xia Emperor had sent
Sword Immortal Evergreen and Fairy Snowdance to reinforce them. If
they hadn’t, the five Heaven Punishers wouldn’t have been able to
hold on for much longer. Sword Immortal Evergreen had slain Fairy
Snowdance, then unleashed an attack that wasn’t one whit inferior
to the attacks of True Immortal Whitepole or the Xia Emperor. This
terrifying attack was not meant to reinforce them…it was meant to
kill them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could the five
Heaven Punishers possibly resist?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Boom! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under repeated assaults
from Sword Immortal Evergreen, Zhuyan Apes, White-Faced Flood
Dragons, and Empyrean God golems…the five Heaven Punishers
instantly were shattered into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local battlefield,
which held 30% of the forces of each side, had just changed
dramatically!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the
Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
was watching this entire battle from afar. The Godking had secretly
told him long ago that the Seamless Gate had hidden an extremely
important chess piece within the forces of the Crimsonbright Realm, a
chess piece which, when employed at the right moment, could cause the
entire course of the battle to change. As for who that chess piece
was, Daofather Ink Bamboo didn’t know. Only the Godking himself
knew. Clearly, this was an extremely important secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daofather Ink
Bamboo’s eyes lit up. He couldn’t help but feel overjoyed when he
saw Sword Immortal Evergreen suddenly kill Fairy Snowdance, then
assault the five Heaven Punishers below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an
eye…all five Heaven Punishers were destroyed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local battlefield
had instantly changed. The Crimsonbright Realm had lost two Pure Yang
True Immortals and five Heaven Punishers, whereas the Seamless Gate
had not only gained the powerful Sword Immortal Evergreen, the forces
that had been assaulting the five Heaven Punishers were freed up as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Launch an all-out
attack!” Daofather Ink Bamboo knew how rare an opportunity like
this was. He immediately sent out the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Launch an all-out
attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather’s voice
rang out in the minds of every single commander, Empyrean God, and
True Immortal of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The Nine
Cloudmist Fairies, who had previously been locked into a stalemate,
suddenly exploded with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The three
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater, who had been battling
separately in the region, all revealed looks of joy. Diremonster God
Skyswallower roared loudly, “Assemble into formation!” Instantly,
the three Diremonster Gods charged towards each other, joining
together into formation. Divine power flowed across them like light,
quickly transforming them into a towering, bald, three-eyed Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon’s
aura was utterly unearthly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various White-Faced
Flood Dragons and Zhuyan Apes actually began to crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as they
crumbled…they reformed into multiple Empyrean God golems. Each
White-Faced Flood Dragon instantly transformed into ten Empyrean God
golems!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
had suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen!” Even
as the Xia Emperor roared with rage, Ji Ning saw Evergreen make his
move as well. He was watching the entire battlefield at all times. He
couldn’t help but feel disbelief as he saw it happen. Although he
didn’t have any positive feelings towards Sword Immortal Evergreen,
he had never suspected that Evergreen was actually a spy for the
Seamless Gate. Fairy Snowdance had followed him for so long…how
could he have been hard-hearted enough to actually kill her?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vile creature!”
Ning ground his teeth, rage blazing within his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Launch an all-out
attack!” A heartbeat after Daofather Ink Bamboo gave the order,
Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice rang out in the minds of his
subordinates as well. “Launch an all-out attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go all out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimsonbright Realm
and the Seamless Gate almost simultaneously began to launch their
most powerful attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the minor
worlds of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dirty-looking
middle-aged man was displaying his martial prowess, leading a group
of beggars at high speed towards a large innhouse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kids, seal that door
up!” The dirty-looking beggar called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of beggars
completely blocked up the doorway, terrifying the guests and
customers who had been eating inside it and preventing any outsiders
from entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honorable sir, if
there’s something you want, just tell us. Why have you brought so
many people to seal off my innhouse?” The innkeeper hurriedly came
out, bowing and scraping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Beggar’s
Clan wishes to block your door, we’ll block your door! I’ve never
liked you. Today I’ve come to eat something,” the middle-aged
beggar barked. “Got a problem?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No problems, no
problems at all.” The innkeeper felt misery in his hearts; he knew
exactly how powerful the Beggar’s Clan was within this city.
Fortunately, these people were just here to eat. “If you want
something to eat, just tell me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple. Gimme…”
Halfway through his words, the look on the face of the middle-aged
beggar changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because, right
at this moment, a voice rang out within his mind: “Eastbreak, come
to the Grand Xia battlefield right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Realmwar had
first started, he had been told that he would serve as a lethal
weapon for the Crimsonbright Realm. To prevent the Seamless Gate from
finding out, the only people who were aware of this were two
Daofathers and the ‘beggar’ himself. Even the message-delivery
system was an extremely secretive one. He had been extremely careful,
and indeed, the Seamless Gate hadn’t discovered him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beggar raised his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large rift suddenly
appeared in the skies above him. The middle-aged beggar took a single
step, soaring into the rift in the skies…and then the massive rift
vanished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guests, beggars,
and innkeeper were all completely dazed by what they had just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan…clan
leader…?” The beggars stared stupidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person extorting
me was…was actually…” The innkeeper was even more dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A divinity. A
divinity!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must have been an
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, the countless
mortals in the region all fell to their knees, kowtowing. They had
seen this Immortal with their own eyes. The massive rift in the
skies…the aura of power and majesty from it…it had filled the
deepest parts of their hearts with utter terror and awe. They would
never even think of resisting such power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia. The
battlefield within Whitepole Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive rift
appeared, and the middle-aged beggar with tousled hair appeared out
of nowhere. He had been roaming a minor mortal world that was located
very close to the Grand Xia, and so as soon as the order had come, he
had been able to immediately tear a rift through the Void to arrive
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastbreak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastbreak, the
divine archer!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Gate who saw the middle-aged beggar appear were all
terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastbreak…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the great
divinity Houyi had vanished, the most powerful divine archers of the
Three Realms had consisted of Eastbreak and his peers. Empyrean God
Eastbreak possessed tremendous power, and his heartforce had reached
the peak of the fourth level. His divine arrows…they had more than
enough power to cause each and every Empyrean God and True Immortal
to feel utter terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if Eastbreak
has come? We have many allies on the battlefield; two or three
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals can combine their power to block his
arrows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can a single
Eastbreak possibly have an impact on our great army?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just as they were
consoling themselves…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine archer
Eastbreak produced a gray fruit in his hands. He swallowed it, then
manifested a silvery-white greatbow as well as a black arrow. He
nocked his bow, then drew it, the tip of the arrow covered with a
blurry gray energy aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Daofruit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of
primordial chaos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow flashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It lanced through the
skies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh!!” “No!”
Three White-Faced Flood Dragons were pierced by that black streak of
light. The three White-Faced Flood Dragons immediately collapsed,
revealing the Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single arrow had
slain three of the White-Faced Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastbreak pulled back
his bow yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madman. He’s using
both the power of primordial chaos and filling his arrows with
heartforce. Given his terrifying archery skills…his arrows are
almost comparable to a Daofather’s strikes. They even cause spatial
compression; we won’t even have a chance to hide into our Immortal
estates. But he’s going after the White-Faced Flood Dragons and the
Bifang Cranes instead of us?” The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
were both furious and frantic…because they knew that Empyrean God
Eastbreak was making the right choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was extremely close
to the Daofather level to begin with. By relying on the power of the
Daofruit of primordial chaos, his full-strength arrow attacks had
already reached the level of power a Daofather’s attacks would
have. But of course, he paid a heavy price for this; a single chaos
Daofruit would most likely only be enough to allow him to shoot two
arrows, with each fruit representing a True God or Daofather
sacrificing some of their insights into the Heavenly Dao of
Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on both sides were moving
in pairs or triplets; in fact, some of them were moving in groups of
seven or eight. If he used his arrows to assault Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals, they would be able to stay alive by joining forces to
defend. Even if he did manage to kill an Empyrean God or a True
Immortal, it wouldn’t have much of an impact on the overall course
of the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But by killing
White-Faced Flood Dragons, Bifang Cranes, Zhuyan Apes, and such
creatures…he was able to slay two or three with each arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo,
atop the walls of the Seamless City, just coldly watched as this all
happened. He smiled grimly. “The Nuwa Alliance really is willing to
spend its resources. They are actually using Daofruit of primordial
chaos to allow a single supreme archer to have an impact on the
entire war. But despite that…he’s only on par with the combined
power of the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater. Perhaps the
three combined are even slightly weaker than Empyrean God
Eastbreak…but they can fight for a long period of time, whereas he
is using up a Daofruit every two arrows. Let’s see how many arrows
he can shoot!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the White-Faced
Flood Dragons, Bifang Cranes, and Zhuyan Apes had been voluntarily
disbanded when the all-out attack was initiated, transforming into
multiple Empyrean God golems. After all…a thousand Celestial
Immortals could command ten of the Empyrean God golems, while three
golems were comparable to each White-Faced Flood Dragon in power.
Clearly, using the same number of Celestial Immortals to control the
Empyrean God golems was more powerful and effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…manufacturing
the golems was very difficult. Daofather Ink Bamboo was only able to
have 20% of his Celestial Immortals control the golems…but despite
that, the Seamless Gate’s forces had just been strengthened
dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To put it another
way…although Empyrean God Eastbreak was very valiant, slaying two
or three thousand Celestial Immortals with each arrow, his impact
merely neutralized the sudden appearance of so many Empyrean God
golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the flow of
battle within the area where both sides had concentrated 30% of their
forces was extremely detrimental to the forces of the Crimsonbright
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that
Evergreen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Crimsonbright Realm were livid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater’s power was within their realm of
expectations, and they had planned for it. Sword Immortal Evergreen’s
betrayal, however, caused their situation to turn uglier than they
had expected. It must be understood that in mortal wars, there had
been cases where a flag-bearing soldier fell, bringing his flag down
with him and resulting in the loss of both the battle and his
country.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s slaying of Fairy Snowdance and the five Heaven
Punishers, then continued attacks alongside the Seamless Gate against
the forces of the Crimsonbright Realm…it had caught them completely
offguard. Unable to reinforce each other in time, they lost another
Raindragon, two Pangu War-Formations, and six more Heaven Punishers.
Only after such heavy losses was Evergreen forced back by the utterly
berserk forces of the Crimsonbright Realm, driving him into the
protective embrace of the three Diremonster Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, the state of
the battle around Ji Ning had turned horribly grim for the
Crimsonbright Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disparity in power
between two sides was now enormous.

Chapter 37 - Seven Seniors, Please Assist
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The city walls of the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity. Daofather Crimsonbright was watching over
the entire battlefield, his heart scorching with worry. He
immediately saw how ugly the situation had become in the area where
Ji Ning and the Xia Emperor were battling. Sword Immortal Evergreen
had launched his traitorous attack there, causing a minor collapse in
the battle lines of the Crimsonbright Realm. Fortunately, the Xia
Emperor and Ji Ning had gone all out to hold their positions,
allowing things to settle down…but the situation was still
extremely grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing I
can do. The many Empyrean God golems that just appeared on the
Seamless Gate’s side are spread out throughout the battlefield.
Multiple areas need reinforcements.” Daofather Crimsonbright stared
at the battlefield. The distant divine archer, Eastbreak, was sending
out arrows like needles from the God of Death. Every single arrow
slew two or three White-Faced Flood Dragons, Zhuyan Apes, or other
types of Terrorbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can only choose to
give up Xiamang’s region for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have Eastbreak keep
his region suppressed.” Daofather Crimsonbright knew that he had to
make his choice right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had Eastbreak
suppress the entire battlefield…because of how bad the situation
was for Ji Ning and the Xia Emperor’s area, they would still
probably be at a disadvantage. As for the other regions…if
Eastbreak wasn’t able to help them out enough, they would probably
only be able to reach a stalemate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Eastbreak going
berserk on a few select regions…although Ji Ning’s region was in
trouble, the other seven regions temporarily gained the upper hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastbreak’s arrows
were simply too terrifying. However, both Daofather Crimsonbright and
Daofather Ink Bamboo knew very well that these terrifying arrows used
up Daofruits of primordial chaos, with each Daofruit only sustaining
two arrows. He wouldn’t be able to maintain this state for too
long…and so he had to kill as many as he could, while he could!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, your region
will have to rely on yourselves.” Daofather Crimsonbright hardened
his heart. He had experienced the destruction of the Primordial
World; he knew that sometimes, sacrifices had to be made for the sake
of the bigger picture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EVERGREEN!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
stared at the distant Sword Immortal Evergreen, cold light flaring
from his eyes, his face completely ashen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humiliation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been
catastrophically deceived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had trusted Sword
Immortal Evergreen too much; he hadn’t suspected him of being a spy
at all. The main reason for this was because Evergreen normally
didn’t have any friends; in fact, he was an extremely solitary
person who focused completely on the Dao. Evergreen had lived in
seclusion within that Daoist temple on his minor world for countless
years, focusing on the Dao. It might be easy for a person to pretend
for a period of time, but to pretend for their entire life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evergreen, however, was
terrifying in this regard. In the past, Daofather Crimsonbright had
rather admired Evergreen for his temperament and his complete
dedication to pursuing the Dao. He had believed that of his many
disciples, Evergreen had the best chance of becoming a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen is focused
on pursuing the Dao, and his heart has no other desires; I definitely
wasn’t wrong about this. When he killed Snowdance, he showed no
mercy or hesitancy at all; he didn’t even show the slightest hint
of doubt in his eyes. After killing her, he immediately destroyed her
corpse. His heart is truly merciless. I wasn’t wrong…he is indeed
incredibly dangerous.” Daofather Crimsonbright knew very well that
such a decisive, merciless person would likely become an astonishing
figure in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One’s level of
accomplishments had nothing to do with whether one was virtuous or
vile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stronger one’s
Dao-heart was, the easier it would be for one to travel a long
distance on the Immortal path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the most vile of
individuals, even when they did vile things, they wouldn’t truly
believe themselves to be vile. A completely pure Dao-heart could be a
terrifyingly powerful thing, even if that pureness was evil; not even
demonheart tribulations and other such tribulations would have an
effect on it. However, there were very, very few such ‘natural-born
devils’. Prior to this, Daofather Crimsonbright hadn’t been able
to tell that Evergreen was such a person…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battlefield region
where Ning and the Xia Emperor were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen.” Ning
was utterly enraged by what he was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All-out attack!”
The Daofather’s order came. The three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater temporarily paused their attacks, beginning to join
together into a formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Taking advantage of the
lull offered by the three Diremonster Gods pausing, the enraged Ji
Ning charged straight towards Sword Immortal Evergreen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept out with his
two arms. Boom! Boom! Boom! The Empyrean God golems that had been
bothering him were all knocked flying backwards. The difference in
power was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Bifang Crane
commanded by an Empyrean God golem flew forward towards him.. This
particular Terrorbeast looked like an Immortal crane. Its body was
completely azure, and it was bathed in fiery flames as its blazing
wings flapped. It only had a single claw, but this claw was enormous
and pitch-black. As the Bifang Crane flew forward, its claw ripped
forward towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he reached
out with both arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He grabbed that giant
claw with his hands. The Bifang Crane suddenly manifested a black
wing in front of it, smashing it down towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Wielding’ the claw
with both hands, Ning smashed the Bifang Crane towards a White-Faced
Flood Dragon in front of him. As for the black wing…Ning just
gritted his teeth and endured the blow. In this moment, he unleashed
all of the power of his soul heartforce technique. By now, he had
nearly reached the ‘expert’ level in the soul heartforce
technique; the increase in power was quite noticeable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This made it so that he
was able to take control over increasingly greater amounts of the
flood of natural energy being generated by the Heaven Punisher. His
body quickly began even stronger and even more resilient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
black wing slammed against Ning, but it only left behind a small
wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did his strength
just…” The Bifang Crane was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bifang Crane was
slammed straight down against a White-Faced Flood Dragon, knocking it
flying away. Ning kept one hand around the claw of the Bifang Crane,
manifesting an incredibly sharp sword within his other hand.
Tightening his grip around the sword, he viciously stabbed it towards
Bifang Crane’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two lightning-fast
sword-strikes passed straight through the Bifang Crane’s boddy,
causing it to instantly begin to break apart. Many Celestial
Immortals and Loose Immortals began to run, with the Pure Yang True
Immortal commander the first to flee in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Two massive
shields appeared within Ning’s hands, and he smashed them towards
each other, with the fleeing Pure Yang True Immortal caught between
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two shields
slammed together, countless Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals
perished. The True Immortal simultaneously used an evasive technique
as well as magic treasures to resist, but Ning had already unleashed
his true power. His soul heartforce had nearly reached the expert
level, and the amount of power he now unleashed was simply
astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this…”
The True Immortal felt a great power sweep through his magic
treasures like a sword sweeping through rotted wood. And then…boom!
He was completely disintegrated by the collision of the two massive,
mountain-like shields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill this Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance,
the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater had already
transformed into the Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were stunned and
furious. They hadn’t expected that during the short period of time
when they had paused their attacks, Ji Ning would have wiped out one
of their Immortal armies. And even more importantly…he had even
killed the True Immortal commander! They thought that the deceased
True Immortal was to blame for his carelessness; they had no idea
that Ji Ning, upon seeing Evergreen turn traitor, had known that the
situation was grim and so had finally unleashed his full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of Ning’s
Heaven Punisher had instantly increased several times over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the nine-headed
lion, the ‘Great Sage Who Devours the Skies’, was to once more
fight head-on against Ning…he would lose even more disastrously
than last time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
Three-Eyed Demon charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie it down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The True Immortals and
Raindragons were all going all-out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that he had
no time to continue his slaughter of the fleeing Immortals. He
immediately turned and charged straight towards the Three-Eyed Demon.
While charging forward, Ning launched a kick towards a nearby Zhuyan
Ape. BOOM! The Zhuyan Ape was not only knocked flying, it also blew
apart in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chains…black
dragons…golden light…snow flowers…vines…tendrils…strange
runes…all sorts of spells and magic treasures landed on the body of
the Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Three-Eyed
Demon’s aura wasn’t diminished in the slightest. It completely
ignored the spells and magic treasures, focusing only on Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Evergreen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill this traitor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Raindragons
and Heaven Punishers had gone berserk as well. In fact, they ignored
their own safety as they launched all-out assaults of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen had taken advantage of the earlier opening to lead the
Seamless Gate army in wiping out a Raindragon, two Pangu
War-Formations, and six Heaven Punishers. After the situation turned
dangerous, he had immediately begun to flee towards the Three-Eyed
Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning and the
others were going all-out in their efforts…the Three-Eyed Demon
simply held too enormous of an advantage. The Seamless Gate had also
sent out other Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and armies as well.
After Sword Immortal Evergreen had caused heavy casualties, more
forces of the Seamless Gate had been freed up to assist the
Three-Eyed Demon..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
definitely going to win this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Sword Immortal
Evergreen flew towards the Three-Eyed Demon, he actually said aloud,
“You should all join our Seamless Gate. You’ll be able to survive
if you do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vile traitor, I
swear I’ll kill you!” The Xia Emperor’s eyes were completely
bloodshot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despicable
creature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Foul thing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals of the Crimsonbright Realm were all enraged. They had
been stabbed in the back at a critical moment by one of their
‘allies’; how could they not be angry? And their dearly beloved
junior apprentice-sister Snowdance had also been killed as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher, the mightiest one of them all, finally clashed with the
Three-Eyed Demon for the first time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been very
cautious, choosing to use shields…but he was still knocked flying
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The difference in
strength is too great.” Ning instantly realized this as he flew
backwards. “The stories were true; the Three-Eyed Demon’s power
has already reached the Daofather level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods already possessed tremendous, overwhelming power. The Three-Eyed
Demon they joined together to form had a qualitatively superior level
of strength; it had reached the Daofather threshold. Perhaps
Eastbreak, by relying on Daofruit of primordial chaos, was able to
unleash arrows that were comparable or even slightly superior in
strength…but the Three-Eyed Demon still definitely had a
Daofather’s power. Ning was far from being a match for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and kill Ji
Ning.” Atop the distant walls of the Seamless City, Daofather Ink
Bamboo was sending a mental order to the three Diremonster Gods.
“Ignore all else for now; get rid of Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get rid of Ji Ning.”
The Godking’s voice rang out within the minds of the three
Diremonster Gods as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
The Three-Eyed Demon, filled with a terrifying unearthly aura, was
staring at Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher with all three of its eyes,
watching as it was sent flying backwards. The Three-Eyed Demon
bounded forward with large steps, ignoring all spells and magic
treasures. Its charge simply couldn’t be stopped! Right now, the
Three-Eyed Demon had only a single goal…to kill Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The calm Empyrean God
Redsnow. The child-like Empyrean God Primalfire, whose eyes flashed
with savage light. Empyrean God Snow Scorpion. Empyrean God
Dovesnake. Empyrean God Ninefangs. Empyrean God Sunblaze. Empyrean
God Darkmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six of them were
watching the battle outside. The giant yellow bear, through his
attunement to the scenes happening outside the estate, was revealing
images of the battle in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They saw the Three-Eyed
Demon take form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They also saw how Ji
Ning’s Heaven Punisher was instantly knocked flying by the
Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those three little
brats of Mount Dragoneater…back then, they were nothing more than
jokes. But now, they’ve become this powerful?” A desire for
battle could be seen in Empyrean God Redsnow’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve disappeared
for far, far too long. Naturally, some powerful figures will have
emerged…but the Three Realms have nearly forgotten how formidable
our Starseizing Manor was.” The bald old man, Empyrean God
Ninefangs, narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nearby
fur-clad Ji Ning, he bowed respectfully and said, “I’d like to
ask you, seven seniors, to please assist.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ji Ning
spoke out, all seven of the Empyrean Gods, along with the giant
yellow bear, simultaneously turned to look towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really want us
to act?” The lovely Empyrean God Snow Scorpion sent urgently to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t regret it.”
The child-like Empyrean God Primalfire sent mentally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve only
promised to assist you once,” the bald Empyrean God Ninefangs
looked at Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Dovesnake,
Empyrean God Sunblaze, Empyrean God Darkmoon, and even the giant
yellow bear sent urgent mental queries as well. The reason why they
sent mental messages was because the battle outside had reached a
fever pitch; they had to communicate in the shortest amount of time
possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Empyrean God
Redsnow remained silent. He just looked at Ning, who looked back at
him. Their gazes met…and their was no hesitation in either of their
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.” This was the only thing Empyrean God Redsnow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Empyrean
Gods couldn’t help but begin to laugh. Blazing eagerness appeared
within their eyes. They had been in seclusion for far, far too long.
Although they had been peaceful for countless years, they remained as
hot-blooded as ever, and had always been looking forward to the day
when they could once more enjoy a blood-soaked battle. The Realmwar
for the Crimsonbright Realm…this was exactly what they were
hungering for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, there was an
explosion of light within the underwater estate as a rainbow of
colors appeared…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battlefield where
Ji Ning, the Xia Emperor, and the Three-Eyed Demon were located. The
battle here between the two sides had truly reached a fever pitch,
with the heart of the battle centering around the Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon
served as the leader for the Empyrean Gods, True Immortals,
White-Faced Flood Dragons, Bifang Cranes, Zhuyan Apes, and golems of
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Crimsonbright
Realm’s side, the Heaven Punishers, Raindragons, Pangu
War-Formations, Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals were struggling to
hold on. Alas…they were at a clear disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen had broken the balance between the two sides, and the
Three-Eyed Demon had just made things worse for the Crimsonbright
Realm. Most importantly of all…even Daofather Crimsonbright had
painfully given up on their region for the sake of the bigger
picture. Ji Ning’s side was now in extremely dire straits.
Fortunately, Ji Ning, the Xia Emperor, and some of the other powerful
figures on their side were still able to fight back for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, all of you.
Just die. What’s the point of struggling?” The Three-Eyed Demon
was acting with wanton brashness. At this moment, the Three-Eyed
Demon was brandishing two giant warhammers in his hands, smashing
them down in every direction. This was the weapon of choice, because
the Three-Eyed Demon was being commanded by the nine-headed lion, the
‘Great Sage Who Swallows the Skies’, who was especially skillsed
in using giant warhammers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Raindragon that was
being assaulted by the forces of the Seamless Gate was knocked flying
towards the direction of the Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, the
Three-Eyed Demon immediately leapt forward, smashing down the giant
warhammer in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Raindragon
tried to dodge, and although the Xia Emperor and the others wanted to
assist…it was too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A giant warhammer
smashed directly on the body of the Raindragon. With a boom, the body
blasted apart, revealing the many Immortals inside of it, as well as
a terrified, silver-haired Empyrean God who immediately began to
flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” The
incomparably savage Three-Eyed Giant once more smashed down with his
giant warhammer, sending it towards the silver-haired Empyrean God in
a vicious blow. Fortunately, the Empyrean God hurriedly split his
body in half and began to flee in two different directions. Although
one of his bodies was destroyed, the other one managed to escape,
allowing him to avoid catastrophe. Despite this, half of his divine
power was instantly used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three-Eyed Demon
has definitely reached the Daofather level of power. I couldn’t
block him, no matter how hard I tried,” the silver-haired Empyrean
God frantically warned the others mentally while flying away. After
moving a good distance away, he cast a few spells and used some
magical treasures, then began to battle against the other White-Faced
Flood Dragons, no longer daring to fight against the Three-Eyed Demon
head-on again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones who did
dare to fight the Three-Eyed Demon head-on were Ji Ning, as well as
the Raindragons, Pangu War-Formations, and Heaven Punishers that were
commanded by Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. So long as they
weren’t caught offguard, and as long as there was at least two or
three of them, they were capable of blocking the blows of the
Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was once more
knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During that short
period of time, he had already clashed three times against the
Three-Eyed Demon. Each time, he had been completely suppressed; if
the Three-Eyed Fiendgod had been given just an extra breath’s worth
of time, Ning probably would’ve been killed. Fortunately, many of
his allies were helping him, giving him a chance to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re coming.”
As Ning flew backwards, a hint of joy actually appeared on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Directly behind Ji
Ning, a towering Empyrean God appeared out of nowhere, dressed in a
rainbow-colored armor and wielding a longspear that was thirty
thousand meters long. The face of this Empyrean God was fairly
handsome; it was the face of Empyrean God Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Empyrean God?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’d he come
from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew backwards,
the Terrorbeasts of the Seamless Gate who had come to try and pin him
down were badly shocked. However, moments later, they dismissed the
new threat. “Who cares which Fiendgod this is? Just kill him! If he
appeared out of nowhere, he had to have come out from a dimensional
treasure. He’s just here to provide a bit of help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t really
to blame for the fact that they couldn’t tell how powerful the
Seven Planets God was. Empyrean God Redsnow and the rest of the seven
worked together absolutely perfectly, and they had completely
retracted their auras of power. In addition, this type of Empyrean
God formation was different from the Heaven Punisher Formation; the
Heaven Punisher Formation drew out the natural energy of Heaven and
Earth, resulting in tremendous power that was hard to control. This
type of Empyrean God formation, however, pooled together the divine
power of the multiple Empyrean Gods who participated in it, using it
to form a physical body that, from the surface, looked absolutely
identical to a real body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s Heaven
Punisher is very hard to deal with; most likely, only the Three-Eyed
Demon can kill him. Let’s get rid of this new Fiendgod instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Get rid of
him first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Terrorbeasts of the
Seamless Gate knew very well that in a fight, it was better to sever
a single finger than to damage ten. Thus, quite a few combatants of
the Seamless Gate chose to temporarily ‘spare’ Ji Ning, instead
focusing their attacks on the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
stared at them coldly in a manner reminiscent of Empyrean God
Redsnow. However, the longspear in its hands swung out in a simple
sweeping motion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It completed a full
circle around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty thousand
meter longspear instantly caused snow to begin to drift down in the
surrounding area, with time itself beginning to turn chaotic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
A Zhuyan Ape was just about to charge forward, but it suddenly felt
an incredibly sick feeling, one generated after suffering from
temporal distortion. He felt as though his movements were alternately
between speeding up and slowing down dramatically. This sort of
temporal distortation made it want to vomit blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It felt trapped within
a nightmare. Before it could wake up…a longspear smashed directly
onto its body. BOOM! Its body instantly blew apart. The Immortals
within it began to flee in terror, but the drifting flakes of snow
instantly froze them solid. Aside from a very small number who
managed to hide into their Immortal estates, the rest all perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That simple sweeping
motion by the longspear resulted in the destruction of a total of
four White-Faced Flood Dragons, two Zhuyan Apes, and three Empyrean
God golems in the surrounding area. Even the incredibly resilient
golems had been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the four
White-Faced Flood Dragons had been commanded by an Empyrean God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“White snow drifting
about…a longspear…can it be him?” The fleeing Empyrean God
revealed a look of terror. “If it’s the Seven Planets God…I’m
finished…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He instantly split his
body into seven parts, beginning to flee in multiple directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish swish
swish swish swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light reflected off the
longspear, creating seven flowery streaks of spear-light that wiped
out all seven of the clones of the fleeing Empyrean God. If the
Three-Eyed Demon could be described as focusing on ‘overwhelming’
and ‘crushing’ its foes, then the Seven Planets God commanded by
Redsnow focused on ‘accuracy’ and ‘precision’. His spear-arts
were simply perfect. The field of temporal distortion only lasted an
instant, but to the enemies trapped within, it felt like an eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the fleeing
Empyrean God already knew that he was doomed. If he divided into too
many bodies, each body would be extremely weak; most likely, even the
snowflakes would be capable of destroying him. However, if he didn’t
create enough bodies, then he probably wouldn’t be able to dodge
the spear. Thus, he chose to split into seven and give it a try…but
he failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, he died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha. How long
has it been? Our Seven Planets God of the Starseizing Manor has once
more appeared in the world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful! Darkmoon, it’s been a long time since we brothers have
fought together like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill!
Kill them until their blood flows like a river. Fight until the
heavens collapse and the earth caves!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Kill them
all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven Empyrean Gods
were filled with a desire to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the other six
Empyrean Gods called out in delight, the controller of the Seven
Planets God, Redsnow, sent it charging forward with full power as he
displayed the full power of the terrifying spear-arts he had spent
countless eras perfecting. It must be understood that when the Seven
Planets God had battled against the three Queen Mothers, those three
had created bodies from an enormous amount of energy, with each body
having reached the Daofather level. When faced with the Seven Planets
God, however, they were still injured. The only issue was that their
bodies had no weak spots at all, allowing them to automatically
recover from any wounds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The longspear
swept sideways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! It stabbed
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! It smashed
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longspear moved
like a roving dragon. Wherever the Seven Planets God moved past, it
left devastation in its wake. It actually slaughtered its foes even
faster than the Three-Eyed Demon. Clearly, its unfathomable,
ghostlike spear-arts were even harder to defend against than the
overwhelmingly powerful warhammers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the city walls of
the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
had a hint of a smile on his face as he watched the entire
battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ink Bamboo, it seems
we are going to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The stage is
already set; Crimsonbright shouldn’t have any cards left to play
that can change the course of events. You really are formidable; you
were actually able to place a chess piece like Sword Immortal
Evergreen by Crimsonbright’s side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…that was-”
The Godking’s voice suddenly halted, but not before a hint of shock
and rage appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
and the Godking were conversing through space through usage of
coresense. Right now, they both revealed looks of
astonishment…because they saw the Seven Planets God suddenly appear
out of nowhere. When it began to massacre their soldiers, when its
longspear began to lay waste to the many Fiendgods and Terrorbeasts
of the Seamless Gate, and especially when it slew an Empyrean God…all
doubts were erased from their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“White snow drifting
about…hair as crimson as blood…can it really be…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you, be
careful. That’s the number one wargod of the Starseizing Manor,
Empyrean God Redsnow. He’s dressed in that rainbow armor; this is
very likely the former ‘Seven Planets God’ of the Starseizing
Manor, with Redsnow as the commander.” Daofather Ink Bamboo
immediately sent a mental message to the three. He had never
personally seen Empyrean God Redsnow before, but as a Daofather, he
had long ago seen reports which included Redsnow’s appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon
had been engaging in a wild slaughter. Upon hearing this message,
they took a look at what was happening…and saw the Seven Planets
God, which was slaughtering its foes even faster than the Three-Eyed
Demon had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number one
wargod of the Starseizing Manor? White snow drifting about, hair
crimson as blood…Empyrean God Redsnow, who roamed about during the
Primordial Era?” The nine-headed lion was shocked, while the
gold-feathered eagle and the broken-horned dragon felt stunned as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had lived through
the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, however,
they weren’t very well known. When they had styled themselves as
the Great Sages, they had actually been mocked. Back then, however,
Empyrean God Redsnow had been an even greater legend than the Seven
Great Diremonster Sages. He was a peerless god of war who had been
famous long ago, back when the humans had begun to fight with the
Fiendgods for control of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the Empyrean God
spearwielders of the Primordial Era, there were two who were
exceptionally famous and exceptionally powerful. The first was the
most powerful wargod of the Celestial Court, Yang Jian 1. The second
was the ancient Empyrean God Redsnow, who had followed the True God
of Primordial Chaos, Daoist Threelives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Primordial Era,
the difference between them and Empyrean God Redsnow was simply
unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however…the
three of them stood at the very pinnacle of power amongst Empyrean
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if it’s
him? So what if he was strong back then? We’re not the weaklings we
used to be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I refuse to
believe that we can’t beat those seven cowardly mice who have been
hiding all this time. The Starseizing Manor? It might’ve been
famous in the Primordial Era, but that was countless years ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother,
second brother, let’s attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon
didn’t show any fear at all as it charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
Empyrean God. Where did he come from? Is he here to help our
Crimsonbright Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“White snow drifting
about…a longspear…? Can this be the number one wargod of the
Starseizing Manor of the Primordial Era…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that Redsnow?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the Seven
Planets God, with Redsnow as the commander!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, that’s
Empyrean God Redsnow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Crimsonbright Realm also noticed this terrifying Fiendgod, filled
with an unearthly, murderous aura and possessed of a power that had
reached the Daofather level. There were quite a few Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals who had been alive during the Primordial Era, and so
they had heard of the legends of Empyrean God Redsnow. Some had even
seen him in person. For example…the Xia Emperor himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the three
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater possess unstoppable might as
well. They stand at the very pinnacle of power amongst Empyrean Gods,
and the Three-Eyed Demon they’ve joined together to form has
reached the Daofather level of power. Can the Seven Planets God which
Redsnow is commanding defeat the Three-Eyed Demon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be
dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimsonbright
Realm’s forces were slightly nervous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!” Bellowing
loudly, the Three-Eyed Demon charged forward towards the Seven
Planets God with two warhammers at the ready, each step causing a
minor earthquake. It no longer paid any attention to Ji Ning; its
full focus was on the Seven Planets God before it. The Three-Eyed
Demon had only one thought in its mind…to completely wipe out this
target!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hmph, naught but an old
bastard who had been hiding like a coward for countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
Seven Planets God charged towards the Three-Eyed Demon as well,
sending the longspear in its hands to sweep forward. It was like
pushing through tall grass; the Fiendgods and Terrorbeasts of the
Seamless Gate that were unable to dodge in time all exploded. Not
even the armies commanded by Empyrean Gods and True Immortals dared
to move close to the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
instantly closed the gap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost everyone on the
entire battlefield was focused on their location. Even the divine
archer Eastbreak, who had only two Daofruits of primordial chaos left
due to his frantic arrow storm assault, was focused on this location.
Even the Daofathers on both sides were watching this fight nervously.
The Seven Planets God…the Three-Eyed Demon…if one of them was
defeated, a lethally effective blow would have been dealt to their
respective sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die! Go die! I’m
the strongest, now!” The Three-Eyed Demon struck like a giant
windmill, hammering down with its two mighty warhammers. The
warhammers even carried spatial ripples with them, a sensation of
absolute massiveness and weight. It felt as though two unfathomably
large continents were smashing towards the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
didn’t use its marvelous, intricate spear-arts. Instead…it took
the blow head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
took a two-handed grip over the longspear. Focusing its strength
around its waist, it suddenly unleashed its full power. Time itself
seemed to twist as countless snowflakes suddenly began to manifest
atop the longspear, forming an utterly enormous and snow-white
silhouette.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A collision that seemed
to cause the heavens themselves to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snow-white
longspear silhouette swept sideways against the great warhammer.
Although it trembled slightly, it still twisted and struck against
the body of the Three-Eyed Demon. The Three-Eyed Demon only had
enough time to place a warhammer in a blocking position before its
chest, but was still struck so hard that it was knocked off of its
feet and sent flying backwards.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 39 - Redsnow The Invincible
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the Seven
Planets God flashed with cold light as it thrust the longspear in its
hands forward. Swoosh! The longspear struck out like lightning, and
around it swirled an almost ripple-like pattern of spatial
distortions, with the tip of the spear gleaming with light. No one
would doubt how astonishing the power of this spear was. The
Three-Eyed Demon had just been knocked flying, but it didn’t have
any time to feel rage or embarrassment. It immediately leapt
backwards, causing the space around it to seemingly blur as it used
an evasive technique. Its movements were very orderly, and it swept
the two warhammers forward to strike at the attacking spear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother,
Redsnow’s not that special. There’s seven of them but just three
of us; it only makes sense that their Seven Planets God is slightly
more powerful than our Three-Eyed Demon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We’re a bit
weaker in terms of the strength of our divine body, but in a real
battle, we can still kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-feathered
eagle and the broken-horned dragon sent mental messages to each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. There
are no Empyrean Gods who can defeat me.” Flames of rage were
blazing within the nine-headed lion’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was an extremely
proud person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was ranked
third amongst the three brothers, and although he was normally very
low-key…his ambitions were far greater than the ambitions of the
other two. His actions in his youth, his roaming of the Primordial
World, and even his decision to call himself the Great Sage Who
Swallows the Skies…all of these were due to his tremendous
ambition. His greatest desire was to grow more powerful…and he had
indeed become incomparably mighty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were born before
me; in fact, you were born when the universe was first established!
You were also a follower of a True God of Primordial Chaos.
However…no matter how good your luck was, I can still defeat you.”
The nine-headed lion had entered a completely berserk state. “Today,
during this Realmwar which is being watched by countless Daofathers…I
am going to take your life, Empyrean God Redsnow, and use it to prove
how mighty I am!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great warhammers in
the Three-Eyed Demon’s hands no longer were swung with mere brute
force; instead, they began to carry a strange, rippling force with
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
remained icily calm as it stabbed forward with its longspear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Boom! Clash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sounds of the
longspear slamming against the warhammer suddenly became rather odd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
was actually unable to overcome the Three-Eyed Demon for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the
Primordial Era, this little fellow wasn’t very famous. He seems
rather similar to that old bull, however…and he’s even a bit more
sinister than the old bull.” Empyrean God Redsnow had tremendous
experience; he immediately understood what the nine-headed lion’s
battle strategy was. He also immediately understood what the best way
to defeat the Three-Eyed Demon was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the beginning, both
the Seven Planets God and the Three-Eyed Demon had all relied on
using tremendous physical power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, the
spear-arts of the Seven Planets God suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh!
Drifting, unpredictable spear-light began to appear in the air as the
longspear seemed to have transformed into an agile serpent, striking
about with no apparent pattern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon
swung about its twin warhammers with tremendous force. Although they
still contained that strange, powerful rippling attribute, the Seven
Planets God’s longspear seemed to be empty and void-like; the
ripples of the twin warhammers were completely unable to affect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
devilish spear-art is this?” The nine-headed lion was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm down, third
brother. During the Primordial Era, Empyrean God Redsnow was
especially famous for his fusion of the Grand Dao of Time and the
Grand Dao of Snow, which he applied in his battle strategies. Given
that he had mastered the Grand Dao of Snow, he must certainly have a
high level of insight into the Heavenly Dao of Water. Look at his
spear-arts; they flow like water in an unbreaking stream, surrounding
by temporal fluctuations. You need to be steadier,” the
golden-feathered eagle sent mentally. The eldest brother and the
second brother were quite formidable as well, and they had been alive
for longer than their third brother had been. They were quite
observant as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I started to use a
Qiankun-based hammer-art, so he began to use this devilish spear-art.
When I slow down and fight more stably, he goes berserk on me.” The
nine-headed lion was impatient as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His previously arcane
hammer-arts suddenly became as stable and as weighty as a mountain,
with each blow of his warhammer containing incomparably massive
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
used all sorts of techniques, be it ferocious chops, lashing blows,
or vicious slashes. The Three-Eyed Demon was forced to retreat
repeatedly, having been forced into a losing position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, we can’t
hold this area much longer.” The nine-headed lion finally began to
grow truly frantic. He truly felt stifled during this battle.
Although he possessed tremendous power, his Three-Eyed Demon was
innately weaker than the Seven Planets God. His supreme battle
technique had been completely suppressed as well! Redsnow’s
spear-arts were simply unfathomably mysterious and profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning continued to
fight, wielding Ananda World-Swords that were many thousands of
meters long in each hand. Sword-light flashed about him as the
Fiendgods and Terrorbeast about him fell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and his
five allies on his ship of light were casting their spells and using
their magic treasures as they wildly assaulted the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Raindragons,
Heaven Punishers, and Pangu-War Formations were assaulting the
Seamless Gate’s forces as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that prior to this, all of these forces had been focusing on the
Three-Eyed Demon. Now that the Seven Planets God was beating the
Three-Eyed Demon backwards, Ji Ning and the others who had been
dealing with the Demon were suddenly freed up. They could begin to
launch unobstructed assaults against the nearby Fiendgods,
Terrorbeasts, Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate.
All of a sudden, the Crimsonbright Realm held an absolute advantage
in this battle region!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen, don’t
flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others were still utterly furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” As soon as
Sword Immortal Evergreen saw the Seven Planets God emerge, he had a
bad feeling. He had immediately begun to flee and only launch spells
and magic treasures from a great distance. Whenever the Xia Emperor
and the others drew near him, Evergreen would immediately retreat
once more. If he retreated any further, he would have left this
battlefield region and entered another one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others understood…killing Evergreen was important, but winning this
battle was more important. Thus, they temporarily gave up their
attempt to kill Evergreen, instead turning their energy to
slaughtering the other forces of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the walls of the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity. Daofather Crimsonbright’s face turned
completely ruddy from excitement, and his lips were parted in a huge
grin. “Redsnow! Ahahaha, it’s been forever since I’ve seen him!
His power seems to have improved a bit compared to before. Is that
the Seven Planets God of Threelives? With the seven of them…we have
a chance to win this war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…we’re out
of chaos Daofruits.” Daofather Crimsonbright glanced towards the
distant divine archer, Eastbreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastbreak had shot out
a total of sixteen arrows, and he had used up almost all of his
heartforce as well as his eight chaos Daofruits. Although he had only
destroyed around thirty-plus White-Faced Flood Dragons, Bifang
Cranes, and other Terrorbeasts, he had tactically chosen his targets
from across the entire field of battle. As a result, the Seamless
Gate actually lost nearly a hundred Terrorbeasts in total! However,
they still had far, far too many Empyrean God golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastbreak is out of
arrows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Counter-attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morale of the
Seamless Gate’s forces, previously at a disadvantage, instantly
surged as they began a wild counter-attack. When they had launced
their all-out attack, they had produced many Empyrean God golems.
Although Eastbreak had caused them to lose a portion of their forces,
their remaining combat power was no lower than the combat power of
the Crimsonbright Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo’s
face was ashen. A perfectly superb situation had suddenly ended up
like this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on his previous
predictions, once Eastbreak ran out of arrows, the other battlefield
regions would return to a stalemate, while the Three-Eyed Demon would
be able to completely dominate Ji Ning and the Xia Emperor in their
region. The Three-Eyed Demon would then lead the Seamless Gate’s
forces to reinforce the other battle regions, breaking through the
forces of the Crimsonbright Realm and crushing them until their
entire line of battle collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When that happened…they
would have won this war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Daofather
Crimsonbright immediately ordered his forces to retreat, the Seamless
Gate would have still dealt the Crimsonbright Realm a devastating
blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow? This
‘Redsnow’ character is actually this powerful?” Daofather Ink
Bamboo had an ugly look on his face. Gritting his teeth, he sent
mentally, “The eighteen of you are to go reinforce the three
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater right away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate who were scattered throughout
the battlefield heard and immediately acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
watched coldly as eighteen of his Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
were began to move. This resulted in the situation in multiple other
battle regions becoming dangerous for the Seamless Gate, but
Daofather Ink Bamboo had picked quite carefully; the battle wouldn’t
be lost as a result. The Seamless Gate still had many Empyrean God
golems, after all, and killing them was very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The combined power
of eighteen Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, as well as the
Three-Eyed Demon…I refuse to believe they aren’t enough to
suppress the Seven Planets God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After defeating you,
the Three-Eyed Demon will then lead the eighteen to sweep through and
lay waste to the other battle regions.” Daofather Ink Bamboo’s
eyes were filled with ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle region where
Ning was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow, be
careful.” Ning immediately noticed the streaks of light flying
towards them from far away. There were a total of eighteen streaks of
light, each of which represented an Empyrean God or a True Immortal.
He couldn’t help but feel shocked and sent a mental message to
Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighteen Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually sent
eighteen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Crimsonbright
Realm’s side. Ji Ning, the Xia Emperor, and the others were
immediately shocked…and then their eyes turned red with bloodlust.
“Kill, kill, kill! The more we kill, the easier it will be to deal
with the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die for me.” A
sharp awl appeared atop Ning’s right fist. He launched three heavy,
vicious attacks towards the head of an Empyrean God golem. Boom!
Boom! Boom! The three lightning-fast punches caused the Empyrean God
golem to completely collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here!” The
Xia Emperor and the others cast multiple spells, completely binding
an Empyrean God golem then sealing it away within a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were frantically trying to whittle away the Seamless Gate’s combat
power, so that they could go and assist the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack Redsnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate that
Seven Planets God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble into
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals flying in the air began to launch their
attacks. The eighteen of them quickly divided into three groups. Nine
of the True Immortals joined together to form a formation, the ‘Nine
Precious Godtowers Formation’. Three of the Empyrean Gods joined
together to form a second staff-wielding Three-Eyed Demon. The six
remaining Empyrean Gods and True Immortals focused on casting spells
and using magic treasures to slow down and bind the Seven Planets
God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just in time.” The
original Three-Eyed God, who had been beaten so badly it had been
considering fleeing, finally let out a sigh of relief. Then,
invigorated, he turned to launch a counter-attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
staff-wielding Three-Eyed God bounded forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend!” The eyes
of the nine True Immortals were filled with madness. They pointed
into the distance, and instantly a pagoda that glowed with golden
light began to descend from the heavens, moving to swallow the Seven
Planets God within its depths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six remaining
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals began to cast spells as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
wanted to move to assist, but Redsnow’s voice suddenly rang out,
shaking the entire battlefield. “Don’t worry about me. Wipe out
the other members of the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His longspear flashed
like lightning. “BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime itself
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden pagoda of
light that was descending towards the Seven Planets God was actually
pierced apart by a single spear-strike. It ignored the binding
spells, sending its longspear out in dragon-like strikes that caused
spacetime itself to twist. Boom! Boom! The unfathomable longspear
seemed to somehow simultaneously strike both of the Three-Eyed Gods
at once. The one wielding the longstaff was instantly knocked far
away, while the one led by the nine-headed lion staggered back
multiple steps as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals, combined with the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater…were actually being completely suppressed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daofather
Ink Bamboo was watching from far away, and his face instantly turned
extremely ugly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” All
the Crimsonbright Realm’s forces, spread throughout the
battlefield, began to roar in jubilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a completely
different world. Mount Innerheart..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti was
seated in the lotus position. Next to him sat a wizened old man who
held a fan in his hands; Subhuti’s second disciple, ‘Crazy Ji’.
The two of them were both watching this Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spacetime?” Crazy
Ji called out in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti’s eyes lit up
as he revealed a smile. “This red-haired kid has actually managed
to merge the Grand Dao of Space and the Grand Dao of Time into one.
He’s begin to truly touch upon the power of spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master, for having found another with such talent,” Crazy Ji said
immediately.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_40___Allfiend_World"></A>
Chapter 40 - Allfiend World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t overstate
things. This red-haired kid has just touched upon spacetime; he can
be considered to have just barely gained a basic level of insight
into it.” Subhuti sighed. “Still…I’ve finally found a
suitable successor to the supreme skills I developed, just as the
great tribulation has arrived. It seems the heavens have taken pity
on me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji nodded as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of Subhuti’s
disciples believed that their second brother, Crazy Ji, had become
the true heir and successor to their master’s skills. This wasn’t
wrong; Crazy Ji had learned all of Subhuti’s Buddhist techniques
and Daoist techniques, as well as even the [Dream of the Three
Realms]. Naturally, Crazy Ji had long ago reached the Daofather
level, and was ranked as the highest authority amongst the countless
Arhats of the Buddhist Sangha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji himself knew
very well, however, that the true supreme technique of his master,
Patriarch Subhuti…was a supreme spacetime technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Subhuti
was able to be so mysterious was precisely because his mastery over
spacetime was absolutely astonishing. Other Daofathers couldn’t
even locate his ‘Crescent’ major world, thanks to his utterly
amazing control over spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has finally
found a successor for his supreme technique. It seems as though the
heavens are on our side,” Crazy Ji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti raised his head
to glance towards the skies. “The Seamless Gate’s ‘king’
ended up merging himself into the Dao of the Heavens. My Crescent
world is governed by the Dao of the Heavens as well. The other
Daofathers might not be able to find it, but the Seamless Gate’s
‘king’…he might not have been able to find it before fusing
with the Dao of the Heavens, but now, by relying on the Dao of the
Heavens, he can. This means that the living creatures on this world
will not be able to escape this storm either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are worrying too
much, master. That ‘king’…in the end, he’s still just a part
of the Dao of the Heavens, now. He cannot simply act as he wishes,”
Crazy Ji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes…and so we have
a chance to win.” Subhuti nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow
wasn’t the only one in the Three Realms to have gained a basic
level of skill in spacetime; two other Daofathers had as well. They
were members of the Nuwa Alliance, but these two Daofathers had their
own paths to follow; there was no way they would divide their
attention to focus solely on the path of spacetime. After all, there
were many paths of training in the Dao, with the most powerful one
still being the path of primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two who had
completed that path were Pangu and Nuwa.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia.
Whitepole Commandery. The battlefield of the Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
brandished its longspear, causing spacetime to fluctuate and change
as white snow drifted down. It hammered down upon the forces of the
Seamless Gate, including the group of Empyrean Gods/True Immortals
and the three Diremonster Gods, to the point where they found it hard
to even withstand its blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too powerful.
Empyrean God Redsnow is too powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has no weaknesses
at all. His group combat skills and his solo combat skills…all of
them are perfect and flawless. No matter how well we coordinate with
each other, we still have some flaws and openings. We’re going to
lose for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We simply can’t
stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods, the Immortals of the Nine Precious Godtowers Formation, and the
others all felt completely despair and powerlessness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Dao of combat is
completely flawless. It’s as though he was born to fight this sort
of war.” The eldest brother of the three, the gold-feathered eagle,
let out a shocked sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t forget that
he was born when Heaven and Earth was first created. He experienced
the very earliest wars of the universe. Large-scale battles like
this…he’s been through countless numberse of them, and his battle
style was honed, tempered, and perfected countless times through
those countless battles. In the end, we simply didn’t have the
chance to experience that era. We haven’t experienced enough of
these large-scale battles. Although our third brother is comparable
to Empyrean God Redsnow in terms of the Dao, in a real life-and-death
battle, especially one on a battlefield like this…he’s still a
bit inferior. Now that Empyrean God Redsnow is commanding the Seven
Planets God…the Three-Eyed Demon which our third brother is
commanding is naturally going to be weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, let’s
retreat. We can’t stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s
retreat. Let’s reflect on what we’ve learned, then fight him
again in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The
nine-headed lion nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three-Eyed Demon
sent a mental message that echoed in the minds of all allies present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the many
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals that had been battling the Seven
Planets God immediately began to retreat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack! Don’t let
them escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the Xia
Emperor, and the other Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, Heaven
Punishers, Raindragons, and Pangu War-Formations instantly began a
frenzied pursuit upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most dazzling
figure of all was that of the Seven Planets God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His longspear…it was
a life-taking instrument of death. Even the Three-Eyed Demons had
fled rather than face it; naturally, there was now nothing and no one
capable of stopping it at all. Within this battle region, the
Seamless Gate’s forces quickly began to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the
Seamless City. Daofather Ink Bamboo was watching over the entire
battlefield here. Upon seeing that the eighteen Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals he had sent out were still unable to stop the Seven
Planets God, he knew that this battle was over! As he expected…just
a short while later, the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater
began to lead the others in a frantic retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw!”
Daofather Ink Bamboo had a dark look on his face. He said just that
single word, his voice echoing throughout the entire battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Gate in every single region on the battlefield were in
difficult situations. Upon hearing the order be given, they all let
out sighs of relief and began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Empyrean God
Redsnow…” Daofather Ink Bamboo stared at the Seven Planets God,
an ugly look on his face. He knew that there was a limit to the
amount of energy it could unleash; the reason why it had been so
incredibly powerful was because of the person commanding it. The
reason why the Three-Eyed Demon was so powerful as to have reached
the Daofather level was because its commander, the nine-headed lion,
had an extremely high level of insight into the Dao. The Seven
Planets God was even more powerful, precisely because its commander,
Empyrean God Redsnow, was simply far too formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of his
insights into the Dao, he was actually roughly on par with the
nine-headed lion. He had far too many combat techniques, however,
resulting in the nine-headed lion feeling complete despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Press the attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let them run
off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Crimsonbright Realm immediately began to chase after and slaughter
their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
entire battle line began to collapse as they began to flee. The three
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater, the six Diremonster Gods of
Mount Tonglian, and the other powerful Empyrean Gods were now all
fleeing as well. When faced with such an awe-inspiring enemy army…if
they let themselves be trapped, they would be doomed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of
large-scale disorderly retreat actually resulted in incredibly heavy
casualties. The forces of the Seamless Gate had lost all their desire
to fight; the only thing they wanted to do was flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle right now
was a slaughter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
watched silently, not saying a single thing as he saw it all unfold.
He had been forced to give the order to withdraw; if he had tried to
insist on continuing this battle, even more of his forces would be
wiped out. If he didn’t order a retreat right away, he might lose
the majority of his forces. The difference in power between the two
sides wasn’t that great right now; the losses they were sustaining
were acceptable, if painful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
looked towards the walls of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity, where
Daofather Crimsonbright was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
had a smile on his face. A wide smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo turned and left the city walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity. Everyone was cheering in celebration. The
countless Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals were incomparably
jubilant right now. This had been a simply wonderful battle! That
final pursuit in particular…the enemies they managed to catch and
trap had all been utterly massacred. The sensation of being able to
massacre their foes…it was glorious!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Immortals
all looked towards a group of Empyrean Gods who were standing in
midair. The most dazzling figure was a red-haired Empyrean
God…Redsnow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Immortals
and Fiendgods present knew that the person who had changed the entire
outcome of this battle was Empyrean God Redsnow. As a result, they
all looked towards him with scorching, excited gazes. He was too
strong. He was the most powerful Empyrean God they had ever seen, and
the way he had used his spear…it was simply unbelievable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Redsnow, long time no see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Redsnow, you saved the day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow, why have
you come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of those who had
met Empyrean God Redsnow before, such as the Xia Emperor and a few
other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, were chatting with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primelight.” The
Xia Emperor was particularly animated when chatting with the foster
son of Daoist Threelives, Empyrean God Primelight. They two actually
had quite a good relationship in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later, the
entire Eight Dragons Cloudcity began a massive celebratory banquet,
with the countless Immortals and Fiendgods celebrating together. In
the main palace, Daofather Crimsonbright personally feted the
Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and Celestial Immortal commanders who
had risked their lives in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway through the
banquet…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow.”
Daofather Crimsonbright sent a mental message over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather.”
Empyrean God Redsnow replied mentally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sudden
appearance…why is it that I haven’t heard of any Daofathers
arranging you to come here?” Daofather Crimsonbright asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We promised Ji Ning
to help him once,” Empyrean God Redsnow replied. “After having
helped him this time, we’ve finished our assignment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
was surprised that it was Ji Ning who had caused them to come.
Immediately afterward, he grew rather worried. He immediately sent
over, “You are only helping out once? You won’t be helping out
after this?” <BR> Empyrean God Redsnow nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
sent urgently, “The Seamless Gate has suffered heavy casualties
during this Realmwar. It is very possible that they might retreat,
which means the Realmwar will be over. But if they aren’t willing
to accept this outcome and attack again…without the seven of you
standing against the Three-Eyed Demon, we might not be able to win.”
He knew exactly how important the Seven Planets God was, and how much
of an impact it had on the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, you
helped Ji Ning. This time, help me,” Daofather Crimsonbright sent
mentally. “I’m not insisting that you join me in battle, but if
the Seamless Gate refuses to give up and assaults us once again, I’d
like you to assist our Crimsonbright Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow
hesitated momentarily, then began to confer mentally with the nearby
Primelight, Dovesnake, Snow Scorpion, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daofather was asking
them to help out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Daofather
Crimsonbright had indeed been on very good terms with Daoist
Threelives. Ji Ning was participating in this war as well. Soon, they
came to an accord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you have made
the request, Daofather, the seven of us shall do as you ask. If the
Seamless Gate once more comes in force, we shall continue battle,
only stopping once this Realmwar is completed,” Empyrean God
Redsnow sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
instantly let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wonderful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These seven Empyrean
Gods had been the most elite of generals under Threelives. It was
true that Threelives’ death had resulted in the disbanding of his
forces, with quite a few of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of
the Starseizing Manor leaving for other pastures. Only Redsnow and
the rest of the seven had been unwilling to leave due to the loyalty
and devotion they felt towards Threelives. They had continued to hide
within the Starseizing Manor and waited…waited for their new leader
to arise. Each of the seven were incredibly powerful, and when they
joined forces…twenty or thirty ordinary Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals wouldn’t necessarily be a match for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost.”
Daofather Ink Bamboo knew that there was a limit to how much strength
the Seamless Gate could employ. They had reached that limit for the
sake of this Realmwar; it was unlikely that further reinforcements
would be made available. Even if there were further
reinforcements…it’d be hard to make up for difference in power
that now existed. The Seven Planets God was simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms. A
mysterious major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This major world was
known as the Allfiends world. This was the true headquarters of the
many Myriad Demons Caves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a hundred
Seamless Gates; in turn, there were also a hundred Myriad Demon
Caves. They were spread out throughout the Three Realms, frantically
collecting precious materials and building golems. The reason why the
Seamless Gate was so terrifyingly strong was in large part because
their skill in the Dao of Constructs was truly unrivalled in the
Three Realms. They were able to produce some truly top-tier golems
that the Nuwa Alliance was completely unable to manufacture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for how secretive
and mysterious the Allfiends world was? Not even the commander of the
Seamless Gate, the ‘Godking’, was qualified to interfere with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiends world was
under the protection of an even more powerful leader of the Seamless
Alliance. The entire Nuwa Alliance had been frantically attempting to
find a core formation-diagram for the golems, but alas…they weren’t
able to find diagrams for even the Empyrean God golems, to say
nothing of the truly top-class golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a massive,
levitating fortress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fortress had been
completedly sealed off. Inside the sealed fortress, there was an
enormous palace that was a hundred thousand kilometers in size.
Inside the palace, there was a veritable horde of Celestial
Immortals, at least a million of them or more. They were as numerous
as ants, scattered throughout the palace as they focused on
manufacturing various parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the highest part of
the palace, a massive throne was levitating in the air, with two Pure
Yang True Immortals standing respectfully before it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the throne sat a
wanton, dissolute-looking man. He slouched against the throne,
resting his jaw on his right hand while holding a gourd of wine with
his left hand. He stared downwards. “1,800,000 Celestial Immortals.
It’s been three full years…but they still haven’t finished this
Daofather golem?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be done
soon, Grandmaster Blackheaven,” the two True Immortals said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man seated atop the
throne was, amazingly, ‘Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two True Immortals
knew that Grandmaster Blackheaven usually lived a relaxed, carefree
life; all he did these days was order his disciples and
grand-disciples around in creating various golems. It was now quite
rare for him to personally take control over golem production. He
was, after all, the most skilled expert in the Allfiends world in the
Dao of Constructs. In fact, even this ‘Celestial Immortal body’
of his was actually manufactured through the art of constructs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even True Gods or
Daofathers could tell that this body of Blackheaven’s was merely a
golem-body. Even if the Nuwa Alliance slew it, they would have merely
killed a golem-body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grandmaster
Blackheaven…supposedly, he himself wasn’t particularly powerful
in combat. His skill in golems, however, was unrivaled in the Three
Realms. Even the toys he casually created possessed enormous power,
and by relying on these little toys Blackheaven was able to roam the
Three Realms with ease. It was hard for even Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals to deal with him, which was why almost everyone in the
Three Realms treated Blackheaven as they would a True Immmortal. But
none of them knew the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Azurefox or
True Immortal Whitepole knew the truth, that Blackheaven was in
reality the Seamless Gate’s most skilled expert in the art of
constructs. His status in this regard was a tightly held secret.
Although quite a few Celestial Immortals and True Immortals in the
Allfiends world knew, they weren’t permitted to leave this place at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven’s face sank. Crack! The wine gourd in his hand
was crushed into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despite all that,
they still weren’t able to kill Ji Ning. Empyrean God Redsnow?
Empyrean God Redsnow actually appeared out of nowhere and ruined
everything. Fortunately…I didn’t place all of my hopes on those
three Diremonster Gods. In the end, it’ll be up to my golems.”
Blackheaven had an ugly look on his face as he coldly issued an
order: “Issue a decree in my name. The Daofather golem must be
completedly within one month. The 1,800,000 Celestial Immortals are
merely focusing on these parts, whereas I am managing the
manufacturing of the Daofather golem as a whole, but it still isn’t
finished…if it isn’t finished within one month, then all
Celestial Immortals shall be punished by the seven flames…as will
you two!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the words
‘punished by the seven flames’, the two True Immortals were
horrified. They immediately said respectfully, “Yes, Grandmaster.
It will definitely be completed within a month.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. You don’t need
to stay here and serve me,” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two True Immortals
immediately flew downwards, beginning to make the arrangements for
countless Celestial Immortals to refocus on the project. The two
began to go all-out to manufacture some parts as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven just looked
downwards at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven.”
Suddenly, a sonorous voice rang out by Blackheaven’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven was
startled. He immediately said respectfully, “Master, your powers
are all-encompassing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This type of
Daofather golem is too weak. They are just barely at the Daofather
level. When the Endwar comes, the truly supreme True Gods and
Daofathers of the Three Realms, like the leaders of the Daoist Path
and Buddhist Way, will be able to annihilate these golems with one
blow.” The sonorous voice said calmly, “You shouldn’t divide
your attention. Focus on manufacturing the ‘Envoy of All Things’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this is
merely one of my avatars,” Blackheaven said respectfully. “And as
you said, master, this sort of Daofather golem is just barely at the
Daofather level; it’s fairly simple for me to work on it. It’s
just two or three years; it won’t have much of an impact on things.
All these years, I’ve roamed the Three Realms in a carefree,
relaxed manner. That little girl Violetgrass…I did indeed dote on
her. She’s dead, now. There’s no way I can let it go without
taking revenge for her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I never would’ve
thought you’d feel affection for someone.” The sonorous voice
held a hint of amusement within it. “If that’s the case…then go
do what you need to do. However, you should know what truly matters
and what does not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Once this
Daofather golem is completed, I’ll immediately send back these
1,080,000 Celestial Immortals and have them continue to work on the
Envoy of All Living Things,” Blackheaven said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Alliance
only had so many Celestial Immortals, after all. The number of
Celestial Immortals who were skilled in the art of golems was even
lower. 1,080,000 Celestial Immortals who were skilled in golems…this
represented nearly 20% of the total number available. Sending them to
work on this Daofather golem did indeed have a negative impact on the
advancement of the Envoy of All Things. However, manufacturing that
golem was a very arduous, lengthy task; it was true that ‘wasting’
the time of 20% of their Celestial Immortals for just three years
wouldn’t make much of a difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If that wasn’t the
case, Blackheaven wouldn’t have dared to reallocate these Celestial
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
understand this. We absolutely must win the Endwar. We already lost,
once…I don’t wish to lose a second time,” the sonorous voice
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Blackheaven
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The presence departed
from his mind. Only now did Blackheaven let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to go see the
Godking as well. Otherwise, they might foolishly decide to give up
that Realmwar,” Blackheaven mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast world of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was seated
high up on his towering throne, looking down at the world below him.
A figure appeared in the darkness below; it was Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking,”
Blackheaven said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandmaster.” The
black-robed Godking had a hint of amusement in his voice. “Why have
you come to my place, Grandmaster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like to ask
you, Godking, to invite Daofather Ink Bamboo as well,” Blackheaven
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The Godking
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, yet another
figure appeared within the world of darkness. It was Daofather Ink
Bamboo, who glanced towards Blackheaven and said with surprise,
“Grandmaster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the most top-tier
figures of the Seamless Alliance knew who Blackheaven really was. It
was precisely because of his status that they treated Blackheaven as
they would an equal, and in fact were quite courteous to him. First
of all…Blackheaven’s master was, at present, the most powerful
figure of the entire Seamless Alliance…the Lord of All Fiends 1!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition,
Blackheaven was the most skilled grandmaster the Seamless Alliance
had in the Dao of Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whether it was his own
artistry in golems, or his master being the Lord of All
Fiends…Blackheaven had a truly transcendental status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve created a
Daofather golem,” Blackheaven said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather golem?”
The Godking frowned. “Those golems use up many precious materials,
but are fairly weak. Didn’t the Fiendlord give up on them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
looked towards Blackheaven in puzzlement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were core members
of the Seamless Gate; they knew much about the plans they had to
conquer the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was the
leader who commanded the various parties of the Seamless Alliance.
But it was the Lord of All Fiends, however, who was the most powerful
figure of the Seamless Alliance. It was precisely because the Lord of
All Fiends was guarding the Allfiend world that the Nuwa Alliance was
completely unable to acquire the core formation-diagrams they so
desperately wanted. The most supremely powerful golems were all built
within the Allfiend world, and the Lord of All Fiends was
reverentially referred to by the Seamless Alliance as the
‘Fiendlord’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Things
didn’t take part in worldly matters, and so it was left to the
Godking to command the Seamless Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that even when the former ‘king’ of the Seamless Alliance was
alive, the Lord of All Fiends was second only to him! After the king
had failed to defeat Mother Nuwa, he had been forced to merge his
body into the Dao of the Heavens. That way, at least his soul
wouldn’t be destroyed. The Lord of All Fiends, however, had relied
on his own techniques to flee from and escape Nuwa. After so many
years having passed, the Lord of All Fiends had only grown even more
unfathomably powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even major powers like
the Godking or Daofather Ink Bamboo would be extremely respectful
when meeting the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master knows of
this, of course,” Blackheaven said. “I’ve created this
Daofather golem for the purpose of killing someone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing someone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking and
Daofather Ink Bamboo both looked at Blackheaven. The Godking asked,
“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I watched
Violetgrass grow up. I absolutely won’t allow her to have died for
nothing. I’m going to make Ji Ning pay a price.” Cold light
flashed in Blackheaven’s eyes. “He has to die. I know that you
encountered the Seven Planets God during this Realmwar. Once my
Daofather golem appears, the Seven Planets God will definitely be
defeated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Seven Planets
God is defeated…you should be able to win this battle, yes?”
Blackheaven asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it really is a
Daofather golem…then we can win this battle.” Daofather Ink
Bamboo nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew exactly how
powerful Daofather golems were. Even some actual Daofathers such as
Daofather Ink Bamboo, the weaker ones, would find it very hard to
actually do anything to a Daofather golem.. It was much like how many
Empyrean Gods found it hard to do anything to an Empyrean God golem;
the principle was the same. Daofather golems had bodies comparable to
Protocosmic spirit-treasures. They were very hard to damage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They also possessed
enormous, unearthly amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, the truly
supreme True Gods and Daofathers of the Three Realms could easily
destroy these golems. But the Seven Planets God?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
was merely created through a formation of seven Empyrean Gods; its
attack power was just barely at the Daofather level. Its attacks
wouldn’t even scratch the body of a Daofather golem. The Daofather
golem, however, could launch attacks with impunity. In the entire
Crimsonbright Realm…there was nothing and no one that was a match
for it. The only option was for many armies to join forces against
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Blackheaven
character really is quite the madman. The amount of precious
materials needed to forge a Daofather golem is enough to create more
than a thousand Pure Yang treasures. We are currently in the process
of creating the Envoy of All Things, but he’s actually split off so
many Immortals and precious materials to manufacture a Daofather
golem? I imagine the Fiendlord can’t be too happy about this
either.” The Godking and Daofather Ink Bamboo both had the same
thoughts about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With Blackheaven’s
Daofather golem joining us…naturally, we would win. But if the Nuwa
Alliance ends up sending over the Eight Immortals of the High Caves
or similarly powerful Empyrean Gods or True Immortals to assist the
Seven Planets God…they’d absolutely be able to block the
Daofather golem.” Daofather Ink Bamboo expressed his concerns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that happens…then
forget about the battle. There’s only one target; Ji Ning,”
Blackheaven said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it’s just to
kill Ji Ning…fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Godking and
Daofather Ink Bamboo agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They both knew very
well that the Crimsonbright Realm had already summoned a significant
amount of their forces for this Realmwar. The Nuwa Alliance had to
worry about many different theaters of war as well; it wasn’t that
likely that they would send some of their supremely powerful forces
to take part in the Crimsonbright Realm. If they did, their other
regions would be thrown into danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…they should be
able to win this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One month. The
Daofather golem will be ready in one month. A month from now, go to
the Allfiend world and I’ll give it to you,” Blackheaven said,
then disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking and
Daofather Ink Bamboo exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Realmwar in the
Crimsonbright Realm is starting to spin out of our control,” the
Godking said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Seven
Planets God which Daoist Threelives left behind emerged, the entire
battlefield was thrown into a state of frenzied chaos,” Daofather
Ink Bamboo said. “To be honest…to manufacture a Daofather golem
simply for the sake of winning a single Realmwar isn’t really worth
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still. We’ve
already paid a very high price…which makes winning this Realmwar
all the more important,” the Godking said heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
The Seamless Gate isn’t retreating?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless City is
still there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity were often occupied by Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals, as well as the Celestial Immortal commanders. They would
stare at the distant Seamless City, and indeed….that towering black
citadel was still there, not having budged at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve suffered
catastrophic losses, and our Seven Planets God is much stronger than
their Three-Eyed Demon. Why haven’t they retreated?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They fled quite
quickly last time. If they dare to fight us again, we’ll completely
wipe them out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimsonbright
Realm’s forces had very high morale right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Daofather
Crimsonbright often ordered his armies to go out and call for the
Seamless Gate’s forces to come out and fight, but the Seamless
Gate’s armies remained inside their city, not budging at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, half a month
passed after the last major battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a world of
pristine mountains and lovely streams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the vast world
within the Pure Yang Treasure, ‘Violetdawn Pearl’. Long ago, Ji
Ning had relocated all of the Ji clansmen to this place. Uncle White,
Mu Northson, Little Qing, and Autumn Leaf were living here as well. A
short time ago, Ning had moved Yu Wei to this place as well. His
Primaltwin, however, remained within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,
prepared to enter combat at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet
courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Ji Truekeep,
Uncle White, Little Qing, and Mu Northson were all here. Ji Ning was
seated on a stool, occasionally glancing towards the closed door of
the courtyard residence. His senior apprentice-sister, Yu Wei, was
currently within that room along with Autumn Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at him. He’s
not saying a thing, and he has a strange little look on his face,”
Northson snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s about to
become a father. Of course things are going to be different.” The
Whitewater Hound lay there to one side as he smiled towards Ning. He
felt quite gratified. Ji Ning was finally about to become a father.
Finally, he would have a child of his own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, don’t
be nervous. Wait patiently. You’ve been able to wait for several
years; it’s just a little bit longer,” Uncle White said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was a Celestial
Immortal; naturally, she would be completely safe in childbirth. But
when he thought of how his child was about to enter this world, Ning
felt an inexplicable nervousness and uneasiness. Would he be able to
take good care of his child? To protect his child?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five years, two
months in the womb. I wonder what your child will look like, senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This made Ning even
more nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later,
suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your child greets
you, Mother. Uh, where’s my father?” A clear, crisp, childish
voice rang out from within the room, followed by a surprised cry from
Autumn Leaf..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had previously
been nervous. Now, he was simply stunned.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be in such a
rush! Get dressed before you go out!” Yu Wei’s voice could be
heard within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The clothes we
prepared…were too small…” Autumn Leaf’s worried voice rang
out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the
residence was blasted open, and a butt-naked child with tousled hair
came flying straight out of it. Ji Ning immediately saw that this
child was a little girl. Her skin was so soft and tender, it seemed
as though water was about to come out of it. Her eyes were filled
with lively intelligence, and she actually had the divine tattoo of a
flame in the middle of her forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around the
little girl was surrounded by flames, as though she was a young fire
elemental.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The little girl
first happily flew out, then gave the wooden door yet another kick,
causing it to completely splinter apart. She revealed a look of
delight, then turned and swept Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Ji Truekeep, and
the Whitewater Hound with her gaze. She said in a clear, crisp voice,
“You guys…which one of you is my father?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, Uncle
White, and the others all stared in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long moment passed
before they were able to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good…heavens.”
Northson blinked several times. “This…this is a newborn?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
legends, the children of Immortals and Fiendgods are quite
incredible. This is my first time seeing one. This is too…”
Truekeep was somewhat dazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the child
of my son Ning and Yu Wei?” Uncle White was rather dazed as well.
“My son Ning is such an obedient child, while Yu Wei is kind and
virtuous. How is it that they’ve given birth to a little girl like
this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his
formidable Dao-heart, Ning was the first one to go back to normal.
Laughing, he said, “You can’t just run around butt-naked like
that. You have to wear clothes in the outside world; otherwise,
you’ll be laughed at. Uh…you are the size of a three year old
child. They didn’t exactly prepare the appropriately sized clothes
for you…but ordinary clothes can’t withstand the flames that you
are born with control over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed towards
her. Whoosh! Strands of fire and strands of water began to twist
around her body, quickly forming an adorable-looking water-colored
undergarment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are my
father?” The girl-child stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a very
satisfied feeling in his heart as the girl stared at him. The main
reason was that this daughter of his was simply too adorable. The
heavens must have absolutely doted on her, to have blessed her with
such cleverness and cuteness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning smiled
and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s your father.”
Yu Wei and Autumn Leaf walked out from the residence. The looks on
their faces were absolutely priceless. The look on Yu Wei’s face
was particularly complicated. Clearly, the fact that the child was so
big, could speak, could run around, and control fire…wasn’t
exactly what she had expected. Although it was said that the children
of Immortals and Fiendgods would be rather special, most would still
be ordinary infants when first born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I was in
Mother’s belly, I could hear people chatting outside. I know that
my father is named Ji Ning. Is your name Ji Ning?” The girl-child
nibbled on her fingers as she stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I am Ji
Ning.” Ji Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your child greets
you, Father.” With a thudding sound, the girl immediately fell to
both knees, kowtowing towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
The girl looked at Ji Ning and Yu Wei. Quite excitedly, she asked,
“Have you picked a name for me yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei
exchanged a glance. This daughter really wasn’t what they had
expected…but neither Ning nor Yu Wei were ordinary figures either.
Ning laughed. “Senior apprentice-sister, you said that you would
pick out a name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded gently.
“Since our child is a daughter…let’s call her Brightmoon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had shocked
everyone during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. It was within the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Riverse that he and Yu Wei
had grown close and become Dao-companions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today forth,
you shall be named Ji Brightmoon.” Ning looked at the
flame-wreathed girl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Brightmoon? Ji
Brightmoon? Haha…Ji Brightmoon, Ji Brightmoon…” The girl
happily ran around the courtyard, calling her name out repeatedly in
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Little Qing
drew close to Ning. In a low voice, she whispered, “Master, why is
it that your daughter seems to be even more energetic and wilder than
a boy? She was just born, but she’s already this crazy…I can’t
even imagine what she’ll be like in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed and
nodded. “Yes, in the future, I’ll have to teach and guide her
properly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter,
Brightmoon, truly possessed tremendous innate talent. From the moment
of her birth, she possessed a Zifu-level Fiendgod body, and was able
to control the power of fire. This was actually quite normal; even
the weakest of Fiendgods that were born from the natural world were
at least at the Xiantian level of power, while the most powerful ones
that were born forth from the primordial chaos were the Empyrean Gods
and True Gods of Primordial Chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine children of
the Ancestor Dragon, for example, were all born at the Empyrean God
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Primordial Era,
it was quite common for Immortals and Fiendgods to have children. The
Ancestor of the Youngflame clan, Youngflame Freak, for example, was
born from the couple of a Youngflame clan member and a Fiendgod,
which was why he was so ugly. Many Godbeasts, in turn, were created
during the Primordial Era when powerful Fiendgods couple with certain
Diremonsters. Their monstrous bodies contained Fiendgod blood in
them, and so they were referred to as ‘Godbeasts’; the more pure
their bloodline was, the more powerful they would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
both humans, and so their child was naturally a human as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since Ji Ning’s
bloodline was a bit weaker, his daughter was ‘merely’ born with a
Zifu-level Fiendgod body. However, she had no skills as a Ki Refiner
at all. In this regard, she would have to train from scratch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any and every Fiendgod,
even the most supreme of True Gods of Primordial Chaos, would have to
train from scratch if they wished to become Ki Refiners. Daofather
Crimsonbright, Patriarch Subhuti, and the other True Gods of
Primordial Chaos had to slowly train as Ki Refiners as well,
eventually reaching the Daofather of the Great Firmament level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Father!
Piggyback, piggyback!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father’s the
best!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carried his
daughter on his back, wandering Brightheart Island. Although it had
been moved to the Violetdawn Pearl’s world, it hadn’t changed all
that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Fiendgod
Body Refining is so boring. Let’s train in ki instead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon, do you
want a taste of your mother’s crop?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bad Father! You are
so bad!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When facing his
adorable daughter, Ning simply couldn’t put on a show of being the
‘strict father’, no matter how he tried. Yu Wei, however, was
hard-hearted enough to carry a riding crop around with her. Whenever
her daughter was disobedient, she would use the crop to teach her
daughter a lesson and spank her. This caused Brightmoon to be rather
nervous around her. In front of Ning, she would be playful and silly,
but in front of Yu Wei, she would be respectful and extremely
obedient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honestly, you don’t
have to be so strict with her.” Ning had discussed this matter with
Yu Wei in private before. “Our daughter is still young. You can
tell how talented she is. She’s like a scroll of white parchment
right now, waiting to be filled up. We have to teach her patiently.
There’s no rush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in the middle
of a great tribulation, right now. We can’t just slack off.” Yu
Wei shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonstrate the
[Sixteen Stances of the Firecloud Sword] which your father taught
you.” Yu Wei held a willow branch in her hands. Although this was
just an ordinary willow branch, there was a layer of Celestial
Immortal energy protecting it. When Yu Wei grew angry, she’d grab
Brightmoon and then whack Brightmoon on her little bottom with it
until Brightmoon began to howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Celestial
Immortal, it was easy for her to control her power so that the
spanking hurt but didn’t cause her any actual damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Brightmoon’s
eyes were slightly red. She bit her little lips, as though she was
about to start crying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Wei
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Terrified, Brightmoon
immediately picked up a sword and began to train in sword-arts. This
was a sword-art technique which Ning had created; it was perfectly
suited for someone who needed to build up a solid foundation. The
sixteen stances were divided into two parts, the first part ‘hard’
and the other part ‘soft’. Both parts, however, fully encompassed
the Dao of the Inferno.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood off to one
side, beaming merrily as he watched. Brightmoon gave Ning a sad look,
secretly mumbling to herself, “Bad Father! Both of you are bullying
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her potential truly
is exceptional. She’s only trained for three days, but she’s
already broken through to the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner.” Ning
sighed with feeling. “And from the many sword-arts that I’ve
taught her, it seems as though her talent in fire is particularly
high, far higher than in metal, wood, water, or earth. Senior
apprentice-sister was referred to as the ‘Rainbowflame Fairy’,
but she was quite talented in water as well. I myself am talented in
all five of the Five Elements. Why, then, is this daughter of mine so
very different?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five elements,
her talent in the other four elements could be considered as ordinary
for a cultivator. Her talent in fire, however, was at an absolutely
monstrous level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ji Ning and Yu
Wei didn’t think about it too much. Both of them were very
talented. Yu Wei had become a Celestial Immortal; how could she not
be? As for Ji Ning, his Primaltwin had become a Pure Yang True
Immortal! Thus, for his daughter to be so incredibly talented in the
element of fire wasn’t that surprising.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of thundering
sounds rang out unabated as dark clouds covered the earth. The Eight
Dragons Cloudcity and the Seamless City, these two massive cities,
remained in their original positions, levitating high in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ink Bamboo.” A
thought-strand suddenly reached out from across the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonbright.”
Another thought-strand replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Seamless Gate
really is quite lavish. You actually created a Daofather golem for
this Realmwar. Is it worth it? Even if you win, and even if you take
over the entire Crimsonbright Realm…in the future, we’ll still
counter-attack and take it back.” Daofather Crimsonbright’s
thought-strand was filled with absolute furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Your Nuwa
Alliance intelligence reports are quite timely,” Daofather Ink
Bamboo replied. He had just received the Daofather golem moments ago.
Who would’ve thought that the Nuwa Alliance would find out right
away?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been nothing
Daofather Ink Bamboo could do. If it wasn’t for the fact that they
held absolute advantages over the Nuwa Alliance in terms of
intelligence and the Dao of Constructs, they wouldn’t be a match
for the Nuwa Alliance at all. The Nuwa Alliance had controlled the
Three Realms ever since the Primordial Era, after all! The Daoist
Path, the Buddhist Sangha, and even the Primordial Imperial Clan…all
of them belonged to the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Nuwa Alliance,
experts were as common as the clouds, and they had quite a few
top-tier major powers as well. The three most powerful emperors of
the Primordial Imperial Clan…the two leaders of the Daoist Path and
the Buddhist Sangha…some True Gods who had been born from the
Primordial Chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the Nuwa Alliance
had formidable tools available to them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
intelligence, they were only inferior because they couldn’t match
the Seamless Gate’s ‘king’, who had become one with the Dao of
the Heavens itself. However, 1,080,000 Celestial Immortals had been
dispatched to work on the creation of the Daofather golem, and an
enormous amount of resources had been diverted. This was a huge
affair, and the Nuwa Alliance had learned of it long ago. Although
they weren’t able to break their way into the Allfiend world, they
had never ceased their infiltration attempts or their surveillance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ink Bamboo, you
should know that although this Realmwar is important, the struggle
for karmic luck has just begun. You are acting rather excessively in
your attempts to conquer my Crimsonbright Realm.” Daofather
Crimsonbright was extremely dissatisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms were
incredibly vast. Up till now, there had only been a few Realmwar, and
the struggle for karmic luck had just started. For them to start
using Daofather golems right away meant that if the Nuwa Alliance
wished to win, they would have to use enormous amounts of resources
as well. If this was how the game was going to be played each
time…even Daofathers and True Gods would feel heartache at the
cost. The cost would be utterly ruinous, be more than what either
side could endure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms only
had so many treasures in them, after all, and the Seamless Gate only
had so many manufacturing materials. This was why Blackheaven’s
Daofather golem project had resulted in the Lord of All Fiends having
made a personal inquiry. The only reason why the Lord of All Fiends
didn’t pursue the matter any further was because of Blackheaven’s
special status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, our
Seamless Gate is definitely going to win,” Daofather Ink Bamboo
said. “Since you know we have a Daofather golem…you should spend
some time thinking about how you are going to deal with it.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 43 - Sieging The City
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Seamless
City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather.”
Sixty-one Empyrean Gods and True Immortals all called out
respectfully in unison. As for the others? They had all died in that
great clash when the Seven Planets God had appeared. The Seamless
Gate had suffered heavy casualties during that battle; if it hadn’t
been for Grandmaster Blackheaven intervening, the Godking and
Daofather Ink Bamboo probably would have chosen to give up the fight
for the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our losses in this
Realmwar were very heavy.” Daofather Ink Bamboo stared downwards at
his forces. “However…our Seamless Gate isn’t giving up this
Realmwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not giving up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixty-one Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were all surprised. The three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater in particular stared intently at Daofather
Ink Bamboo. The three of them had truly been beaten so badly by
Redsnow’s Seven Planets God that they didn’t have any of their
usual bravado remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, dare I
ask…how are we to deal with the Seven Planets God?” The eldest of
the three Diremonster Gods, the Great Sage Who Swallows the
Mountains, called out in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous creature
suddenly appeared out of nowhere into the air above the palace. It
was a red-gold color, dazzling to behold. It had a body similar to
that of a spider’s, with a total of eight slender and knife-sharp
legs. It crouched there in the air, emanating an aura that caused the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals below to feel shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather golem?!”
A series of shocked cries rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
nodded. “It is indeed a Daofather golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to pick one
of you to be the controller of this Daofather golem,” Daofather Ink
Bamboo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixty-one Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were all stunned for a moment…and then they
grew wildly excited. Even the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater were rather eager. They all knew exactly how powerful a
Daofather golem was, how tough its body was. Not even True Gods or
Daofathers would find it easy to destroy it. It possessed the
strength of a Daofather and was nearly indestructible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The might of a
Daofather golem was definitely above that of the Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are spoils of
war which we gained from vanquished members of the Crimsonbright
Realms; ‘Splitters’.” Daofather Ink Bamboo willed the
‘Splitter’ to transform into the appearance of the Daofather
golem. “Each of you shall take control over a Splitter that has
been transformed into the form of a Daofather golem. Use the eight
legs to launch your attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spar against each
other,” Daofather Ink Bamboo ordered. “The victor shall control
the real Daofather golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were all extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They began to spar
internally against each other. Soon, the more formidable ones were
clearly evident, such as True Immortal Whitepole, Sword Immortal
Evergreen, the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater, the Elder
Fairy of the Nine Cloudmist Fairies…and then they began to compete
against each other as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most dazzling
performances were actually rendered by Sword Immortal Evergreen and
the nine-headed lion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, after a
long and hard struggle, Sword Immortal Evergreen was actually able to
just barely achieve victory over the nine-headed lion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great Sage Who
Swallows the Skies, the eight slender legs of this Daofather golem
are like eight Immortal swords. I am a Sword Immortal, and specialize
in the ‘Eight Trigrams Demonslayer Sword Formation’ that was
created by Human Emperor Fuxi. I’m perfectly suited for controlling
this Daofather golem, which is why I was able to fight against you
for so long and just barely win,” Sword Immortal Evergreen said
with a smile. “You, Great Sage, are an Empyrean God; you are best
suited for close combat, and so were at a disadvantage when competing
with me in this manner. I won, but I was lucky to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evergreen had a very
modest attitude right now. He knew very well when he could afford to
be arrogant, and when he had to lower his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater clearly weren’t people he could afford to
offend. Even if he ended up controlling the Daofather golem, that was
only in service to the Seamless Gate. The Daofather golem belonged to
the Seamless Gate; it hadn’t been gifted to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
nine-headed lion had an ugly look on his face. He had actually lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s face flickered slightly, then quickly returned to
normal. In his heart, however, he mused to himself, “It’s rare
for me to be so courteous, but he actually gives me no face at all.
Once I become a Daofather, you’ll be kneeling before me like an
obedient puppy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen, you shall
have temporary control over this Daofather golem,” Daofather Ink
Bamboo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen shall not
let you down, Daofather.” Sword Immortal Evergreen was extremely
respectful, but his voice was filled with complete confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dark clouds covered the
skies, and a savage wind howled through the land. Drops of rain could
be seen within the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast army of the
Seamless Gate, however, was filled with an utterly indomitable aura.
The energy of the natural world flooded through them in a tidalwave,
causing even the Golden Crow in the skies to appear distorted. The
dark clouds in the skies rammed into each other, causing lightning to
crash down chaotically, as though they too were terrified of the
Immortal army below it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crimsonbright, come
out and fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand army was
calling for their foes to come out and engage them. They were within
just a few thousand kilometers of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity, and
the sound of their cries filled the heavens themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually dare
to call us out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They didn’t dare
to come out earlier, but now they do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, it seems as
though the Seamless Gate feels that they haven’t lost enough men
yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s teach them a
good lesson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity became filled with eager cries. The Empyrean Gods,
True Immortals, and army commanders all flew towards the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main palace.
Daofather Crimsonbright was already seated upon his throne.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
entered, their eyes filled with an eagerness to do battle; clearly,
they wanted to go out and fight right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are not to
engage.” A hint of worry could be seen on Daofather Crimsonbright’s
face as he spoke in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was stunned.
Not to engage?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask,
Daofather…why not?” Empyrean God Redsnow asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
feels a very, very strong desire to take over the Crimsonbright
Realm. They’ve actually manufactured a Daofather golem for that
purpose.” Daofather Crimsonbright shook his head. “Sending you
out right now is tantamount to sending you to your deaths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather golem?”
Empyrean Gods Redsnow, Primelight, Snow Scorpion, and the others
revealed puzzled looks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven of them had
been staying in seclusion on the Starseizer major world for far too
long. They knew very little about the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather golem?”
The Xia Emperor and the others, however, cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled as
well. He didn’t know what this golem was either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should have
already seen Empyrean God golems,” Daofather Crimsonbright said. “I
trust you are fully aware of how hard they are to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. They’ve just
barely reached the Empyrean God level in terms of power, but they are
incredibly tough. It is very hard for ordinary True Immortals or
Empyrean Gods to damage them.” Empyrean God Redsnow nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather golems
have just barely reached the Daofather level of power. They possess
enormous power, and are also incredibly tough. Even I am unable to
destroy one.” Daofather Crimsonbright sighed. “There’s no way
whatsoever for the rest of you to damage it, while it can damage you.
Redsnow…we would probably need a second Seven Planets God of equal
power to yours in order to tie down that Daofather golem.
Otherwise…you by yourselves will be completely dominated to the
point of not being able to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present now
understood. Their hearts turned icy cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For them to have gained
the assistance of one Seven Planets God was already a stroke of
tremendous luck. A second one? How likely was that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single Daofather
golem was much more powerful than the Seven Planets God and Ji Ning’s
Heaven Punisher combined. There was simply no way to fight such a
thing. It must be understood that the enemy also had a Three-Eyed
Demon, which was only slightly weaker than the Seven Planets God. If
they were to truly fight…it really would be a lopsided battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood within the
main hall was quite depressing. Everyone felt resentful and unwilling
to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a ripple
began to spread out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t help but look upwards. Through the gates to the main
palace, they saw that in the distant skies above them, a tear in the
heavens could be seen. Through that tear, out walked a handsome youth
who had a red dot in the center of his forehead. The handsome youth
was dressed in Daoist robes, and he gracefully flew towards the main
palace of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudust greets you,
Daofather,” the youth said with a smile as he bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather
Crimsonbright’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On orders of Human
Emperor Shennong, I have come here to assist you in winning this
battle, Daofather.” The robed youth smiled confidently as he spoke.

Chapter 44 - The Moment Finally Arrives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human Emperor
Shennong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals and
Fiendgods nearby, Ji Ning included, were shocked. Nuwa was the
creator of mankind, and mankind had quickly multiplied. During the
Primordial Era, however, mankind was still a very weak race amongst a
myriad of races. However, the puny race had given birth to three
dazzling, brilliant figures. They were Suiren, Fuxi, and Shennong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under their command,
mankind rapidly and steadily began to grow more powerful, rising to
prominence amongst the races. Mother Nuwa herself cared deeply about
the three of them, and their accomplishments caused the entire Three
Realms to feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
figures of the Nuwa Alliance were, without a doubt, the leader of the
Buddhist Sangha and the leader of the Daoist Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Human
Emperors, however, were comparable to these two mighty leaders!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of Old Man
Yuan and Patriarch Subhuti were ranked below them. But of course,
that didn’t mean that Old Man Yuan and Patriarch Subhuti were
necessarily weaker than them. After all, after countless ages of
training, they might’ve made breakthroughs that allowed them to
reach brand new levels of power. Without actually engaging in battle,
it’d be hard to say…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But from the power that
the three Human Emperors had already displayed, there was no question
about their might at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because the three of them existed that mankind became the masters of
the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Primordial
Imperial Clan had successive generations of emperors, only the three
of them were truly acknowledged as sovereigns by the entire Three
Realms. Even major powers had to bow their heads in their presence.
There was nothing for it; the Three Emperors were simply too strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong, one of the
Three Emperors…he’s actually made his move. He is someone who is
a true ruler of the Three Realms.” Ning secretly sighed in
amazement. “I wonder…now that one of the Three Emperors has made
a move, what sort of a move will it be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the youth
before him say that he came on the orders of Human Emperor Shennong,
Daofather Crimsonbright was delighted. He deeply trusted and
tremendously respected Shennong…but he couldn’t help but ask in
puzzlement, “Does the Human Emperor know what dire straits my
Crimsonbright Realm is in? Daofather Ink Bamboo’s army now includes
a Daofather golem within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Human Emperor
already knows,” the youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can we win?”
Daofather Crimsonbright grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides had truly
fought viciously in this war. Daofather Crimsonbright truly wished to
win as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m confident we
can.” The youth nodded. “However, we still need to plan things
out carefully, and I need to speak to you in private, Daofather. I
have to keep this private and away from the other Immortals and
Fiendgods for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
nodded. Sweeping his soldiers with his gaze, he laughed. “You can
leave for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
all assented respectfully, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the main
palace. The Immortals and Fiendgods were all chatting animatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong has
actually intervened. He’s one of the Three Emperors of Mankind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re definitely
going to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what sort
of method Shennong is going to employ against that Daofather golem.”
Everyone was discussing this matter, and everyone was eager to know
the answer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was walking by the
side with Redsnow and the rest of the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow, do
you think we can win?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should…but
nothing is guaranteed,” Redsnow said in a low voice. “Shennong is
one of the Three Emperors of Mankind. He’s unfathomably more
powerful than even Master had been. For him to send people…he must
have some degree of confidence. However, our foe is the Seamless
Alliance, after all. They have terrifying major powers amongst their
ranks as well. You can view it as them competing on a strategic
level. It’s hard to say who will win and who will lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow
knew very well how powerful both sides were, because during that war
that ended the Primordial Era…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was so, so close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had been
finished. Their side had suffered countless casualties, and even the
likes of Daoist Threelives fell during that final battle.
Fortunately, Mother Nuwa made a sudden breakthrough and reached
Pangu’s level, which was why they had suddenly stormed to victory.
Despite that, the ‘king’ of the Seamless Gate had managed to
merge himself into the Dao of the Heavens to preserve his life. As
for the Lord of All Fiends, he had managed to escape, preventing
Mother Nuwa from being able to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, let’s
just watch as the two sides compete strategically with each other,”
Redsnow said. “For this battle to have reached a state like
this…this is crazier than I expected.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was indeed quite
crazy. There had already been several Realmwars, but they had all
occurred within fairly weak Realms. In truth, the Crimsonbright Realm
could also be considered a fairly weak world; after all, Daofather
Crimsonbright himself wasn’t one of the most powerful figures of
the Three Realms. None of the previous Realmwars, hwoever, had
reached such a crazy level as the Crimsonbright Realm’s Realmwar
had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All we have to do is
wait for our orders. In the midst of this great storm…that’s all
we can do.” Ning thought of his newborn daughter, his incomparably
adorable and naughty daughter. A powerful desire to grow strong
filled Ning’s heart. “I have to become even more powerful. In the
midst of this tribulation, only growing in power will allow me to
have a chance to protect Brightmoon and senior apprentice-sister…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
realize…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A major reason why this
Realmwar had escalated to this degree was because of him, Ji Ning.
First, Old Man Yuan had transmitted to Ning the [Heart Sutra],
resulting in his Heaven Punisher gaining such extraordinary strength
that even the Godking viewed him as a threat that had to be
eliminated as early as possible. And secondly…Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven wished to gain revenge for Violetgrass. Ning asking the
Seven Planets God to help out was yet another new variable that
changed this Realmwar yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if the
Seven Planets God hadn’t appeared, the Crimsonbright Realm would’ve
lost long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast world of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering throne
levitated in the air at the very center of this world. The Godking
sat on his throne, his right hand resting on the throne’s armrest
and gently tapping on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tap. Tap. Tap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound echoed
throughout the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong is
intervening as well.” Lightning flashed through the black eyes of
the Godking. “It seems our Seamless Gate has pushed too hard,
incurring the wrath of the Three Emperors. They want to use this
Realmwar as an opportunity to frighten and shake the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly should
I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking began to
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortal
Cloudust and Daofather Crimsonbright…what exactly are they
planning? What is their scheme? Also, Shennong has sent over just one
Pure Yang True Immortal…what does he have up his sleeves?” The
Godking was extremely worried; these were things which he hadn’t
been able to find out yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking raised his
head to stare at the dark sky. His voice was very low. “What
exactly is Shennong doing? What is the Crimsonbright Realm planning?
Please help me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Heavens
was omnipresent in all places…and nothing within the purview of the
Dao of the Heavens could be hidden from the ‘king’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful yet
incredibly arcane thought-ripple was sent directly to the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
momentarily startled. He instantly revealed a look of delight, then
said respectfully, “Thank you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the war that
destroyed the Primordial Era, their king had suffered extremely
serious injuries. Nuwa had been unwilling to let up on her pursuit of
him, resulting in him being forced to merge himself into the Dao of
the Heavens. Even now, the largest part of the king’s consciousness
remained asleep. But perhaps because he was part of the Dao of the
Heavens, that tiny sliver of consciousness was enough to engage in
some degree of communications with the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that if we
are to win…our opportunity lies with ‘Yu Wei’.” The Godking
nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately began to
summon Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed woman
appeared on the ground within the vast world of darkness. It was
indeed Yu Wei. Her aura had changed slightly; she was quite similar
to Yuchi Snow, filled with a warm, motherly aura. After arriving, Yu
Wei immediately knelt down. “Respectful greetings to you, Godking.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 45 - Shennong’s Medicine
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking sat atop
his throne, staring downwards towards her. “Yu Wei, how have I
treated you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking’s
benevolence towards Yu Wei has been weightier than a mountain,” Yu
Wei responded respectfully from her kneeling position. These words
sprang from the bottom of her heart. In her previous life, she had
turned into a complete demon, had become as berserk as an Asura. It
was the Godking who had guided her out from her berserk state and
helped her recover from it, regaining her mind and her sanity. If it
hadn’t been for the Godking, she would’ve been lost long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had also been the
Godking who had patiently taught them all, one by one. They were all
filled with the utmost of veneration towards the Godking, and were
all willing to die for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was nothing more
than one of countless such individuals. When Yu Wei had become
apprenticed to Patriarch Lu, her status amongst the countless spies
under the control of the Seamless Gate had instantly skyrocketed. The
vast majority of the spies were merely at the Earth Immortal or Loose
Immortal level, after all. Less than one in ten thousand would be at
the Celestial Immortal level, much less have a connection to an
important figure like Patriarch Lu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, Yu Wei was
connected to not only Patriarch Lu, but also to Ji Ning. She had
become the sole chance the Seamless Gate had at reversing their
fortunes during this Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is now time for
you to sacrifice yourself,” the Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei couldn’t help
but tremble…then she pressed her forehead to the ground and said
respectfully, “Please give me your command, Godking.” Every
single spy was waiting for the moment where they would be used.
Things weren’t so bad for the likes of Sword Immortal Evergreen;
even after being exposed, he could flee back to the Seamless Gate. Yu
Wei, however, was merely a Celestial Immortal. There was no way she
could possibly escape at all. And, to the Seamless Gate, even though
Yu Wei was a Celestial Immortal, once her status was exposed she
would instantly become much less valuable to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the Three
Emperors of Mankind, Shennong, has sent True Immortal Cloudust to the
Eight Dragons Cloudcity…” The Godking began to narrate things in
order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei listened
attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In her heart, Ji Ning
and her daughter were who mattered most to her…but the Godking was
very important to her as well. This was partially because of
gratitude, but was also also because the Godking had left behind his
imprint upon her soul. The Godking was capable of influencing her
inner heart without her even knowing about it, causing her to trust
him even more and make her feel even more indebted to him for his
kindness, to the point where she was willing to give up life itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Violetdawn
Pearl’s world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and
their daughter Brightmoon were living a blissful life together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kneel!” Ning had a
hint of anger on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter Brightmoon
meekly fell to her knees, her little mouth trembling as though she
was about to cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said angrily, “You
need to understand the consequences of your actions. Not everyone is
an Immortal cultivator. Your mother and I, as well as your Uncle Mu
and your Grandpa White are very powerful, and we aren’t afraid of
the power of your flames. Most of the servants and attendants of
Brightheart Island, however, are mortals. To you, you were just using
flames to prank them, but to them, they were just a heartbeat away
from death. If I hadn’t noticed in time, you would’ve burned your
maid to death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon didn’t
dare to say a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her parents…Ji Ning
had always been very gentle, whereas Yu Wei was fairly strict. This
time, however…Ji Ning had been truly angered, and his anger had
completely stunned and terrified Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
blamed for his anger. Just two days ago, he had picked a pair of
female maids for his daughter. Both were of the same age, roughly
eleven or twelve years old. The two had naturally been extremely
attentive in taking care of their young mistress, and Brightmoon had
liked them very much and had been very happy when playing with them.
And then…she started to use her flames to tease and prank the
maids, just as she often did with the Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That maid had instantly
been burned beyond recognition. Fortunately, Ning had reacted very
quickly, immediately casting spells on her and providing her with a
spirit-pill, allowing her to make a complete recovery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you how
important it was for you to remember that you live in a world of
Immortal cultivators. I told you that you can be tremendously
dangerous to ordinary commoners. Have you forgotten everything I told
you?” Ning roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…I…”
Brightmoon quavered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you are still
crying?!” Ning growled, “I want you to stay here on your knees
today. You are not allowed to rise until I tell you to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
led Yu Wei away, leaving behind Brightmoon by herself kneeling there
pitiably on the ground inside the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A giant, snowy-white
hound padded past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa White!”
Brightmoon hurriedly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy-white hound
gave her a glance, then continued to pad forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another period of
time, an azure-robed woman walked past as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunt Qing!”
Brightmoon immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
revealed a resigned look on her face as she continued to walk
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we being too
severe to her?” Yu Wei said worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I don’t give
her some punishment this time…in the future, she’ll cause utter
chaos,” Ning said angrily. He then looked towards Yu Wei with
surprise. Laughing, he said, “Senior apprentice-sister, usually you
are even stricter with her than I am. Why are you so soft-hearted
today?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I see that sad
little look on the kid’s face…” Yu Wei shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “She’s
just acting. She knows very well that whenever she puts that look on
her face, we’ll feel sorry for her and ease up on her. That’s why
she’s acting this way right now. This time, we really do need to
teach her a lesson. She’s clearly very talented and innately
clever, but she was still born just a short while ago. She’s like a
blank sheet of paper. She doesn’t know the consequences of her
actions, doesn’t know right from wrong. We have to teach her well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we do. It seems
as though you are even better suited to teaching her than me,” Yu
Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, senior
apprentice-sister, you are a better teacher.” Ning shook his head.
“Mothers are usually more careful and attentive when teaching
children.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded blankly,
not responding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
could sense that something seemed a bit off. This was his
Dao-companion, who had been by his side for many years, after all. He
could naturally sense that her mood was off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Yu Wei seemed
to come back to her senses. Shaking her head, she said, “It’s
nothing. I’m just thinking about the Realmwar going on outside. Now
that my child is born…I’ll probably have to take part in the war
soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled for a
moment, but then he nodded slowly. “Right. All Celestial Immortals
must take part in the war. Prior to this, you were pregnant and
temporarily exempted…but now, you’ll probably have to participate
as well. Still…there’s no rush. As long as the Daofather or the
Xia Emperor don’t say anything, for you to delay a while is a minor
matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s best not to
make things difficult for the Xia Emperor,” Yu Wei said. “I’ll
leave behind an incarnation to accompany our daughter. I had best
return to the Eight Dragons Cloudcity and prepare to join the war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. That works
as well. You can stay in my Darknorth army.” Ning smiled. “Go to
war by my side.” Ning would only have peace of mind if she was
within his own army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei returned to the
residence they previously stayed in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be hasty.
Right now, both sides are watching and waiting. The Seamless Gate has
a Daofather golem, while we should be receiving assistance from Human
Emperor Shennong. They should be planning things out now…it isn’t
time for another battle just yet,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next battle
will most likely be the final, decisive battle that will decide this
Realmwar,” Yu Wei said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Thus, it’s
very dangerous. Later on, we’ll work together in the Heaven
Punisher Formation. You’ll be right by my side,” Ning said. “If
anything unexpected happens, I’ll still be able to protect you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked towards
Ning. She could see from Ning’s eyes how much he cared about her.
This made her emotions only become even more complicated; she felt
both warm and miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, come to my
place.” Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice rang out by Ning’s
ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to go
meet with the Daofather.” Ning rose to his feet, then immediately
flew outwards. As he left, Yu Wei quietly gazed at his departing
figure, as though she didn’t want to miss any glimpse of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon entering, Ning
realized to his amazement that the only figures within the entire
main palace were Daofather Crimsonbright and True Immortal Cloudust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, Daofather. Respectful greetings to you, True Immortal,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” Daofather
Crimsonbright smiled towards Ning, as did True Immortal Cloudust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
said, “I’ve invited you here because I have an important mission
to give you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning
immediately began to listen attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, Cloudust
has come on Human Emperor Shennong’s orders to bring me two
treasures.” Daofather Crimsonbright waved his hand, producing two
jade bottles, one completely black and the other completely white.
Both immediately caught Ning’s eye; could it be that the treasures
within these two bottles were capable of deciding the fate of this
Realmwar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that their foes had a Daofather golem. Were these things even more
powerful than Daofather golems?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within the black
jade bottle is a type of Immortal medicine which Shennong just
finished creating, having spent enormous amounts of work on it.”
Daofather Crimsonbright pointed towards the black bottle. “If you
shatter this black bottle, then the medicine within it will quickly
spread out and take effect within a field of ten thousand kilometers.
All Immortals within the region, including Pure Yang True Immortals,
will find their Immortal energy to be completely locked and
unusable.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning
called out in shock, “Even True Immortals are affected by this? If
they can’t use their Immortal energy, won’t they be like ordinary
mortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daofather
Crimsonbright nodded. “This Immortal medicine is newly
manufactured. Since the Seamless Gate has never even seen this sort
of medicine, they naturally can’t manufacture an antidote for it.
This concoction does, however, have a major flaw; it doesn’t
differentiate between friends or foes! Within ten thousand
kilometers, all Immortals, friendly or enemy, will be affected by
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was normal and
common for most poisons. Poison wasn’t sentient, after all; it
couldn’t differentiate between friend or foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, the white jade
bottle has the antidote within it.” Daofather Crimsonbright pointed
towards the white jade bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you go back,
pour out the medicine into this wine gourd.” Daofather
Crimsonbright next produced a calabash gourd. “Every single Loose
Immortal only needs a single drop. Celestial Immortals need ten,
while Pure Yang True Immortals need a hundred. The Darknorth army
under your command has three thousand Celestial Immortals and three
hundred thousand Loose Immortals. All of them need to drink the
medicine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When battle begins,
the Seamless Gate will definitely continue to try to kill you;
they’ll send their armies to surround and assault you. When the
time comes, just shatter the black jade tablet…and instantly, all
Immortals within ten thousand meters will collapse. Since your army
will have consumed the medicine in advance, you won’t be affected
at all…and the only thing you’ll have to do is massacre them,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was overjoyed upon
hearing this. How wonderful! The Seamless Gate currently had an
absolute advantage in terms of Immortal power, as their many Empyrean
God golems were all controlled by Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it useless
against Empyrean Gods?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The influence on the
divine power of Empyrean Gods is negligible.” Daofather
Crimsonbright nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the Seamless
Gate’s intelligence capabilities…I imagine that they will soon
know that this thing is in my hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This concoction of
Shennong’s is incredibly valuable. The Emperor of Mankind just
recently finished manufacturing it at an extremely high cost.
Although we only have a small amount, we have given it to another
person as well, in addition to you.” Daofather Crimsonbright
laughed, “When the time comes, both of your armies are to
simultaneously use the medicine. Even though the Seamless Gate knows
about it, there’s nothing they can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are very
powerful, and the Seamless Gate has a deep urge to kill you. If they
surround and assault you, you’ll use Shennong’s concoction. If
they don’t surround and assault you, break them down and destroy
them one-by-one,” Daofather Crimsonbright said. “This is an
obvious ploy, but there’s nothing they can do about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up
when he heard this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were definitely
going to win!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t disappoint
me.” Daofather Crimsonbright looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry at
all, Daofather.” Ning was filled with confidence.

Chapter 46 - No Regrets
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning reverently
accepted the black jade bottle, the white jade bottle, and the
calabash gourd!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go now.”
Daofather Crimsonbright smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left the main
hall, now in an absolutely wonderful mood. He returned to the
Darknorth army camp, going back to his own residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back so soon?” Yu
Wei was there to welcome Ning back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning just
couldn’t stop chortling. “Bring me some wine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei immediately
produced a bottle of Immortal nectar. Even as she was just beginning
to bring out the winecups and other drinking implements, Ning
immediately grabbed the bottle, raised his head up high, then began
to guzzle it down happily. He felt a smooth feeling fill his entire
body, surging straight to his head. He couldn’t help but exclaim,
“How wonderful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you are in
quite a good mood, junior apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei sat down next
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I not be?”
Ning laughed. “I’ll have you by my side on the battlefield,
senior apprentice-sister, and we now have a daughter. In addition, we
are going to achieve a grand victory in this Realmwar. Everything
will be just perfect. The heavens are truly kind to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei smiled as well.
She reached out with her left hand to take Ning’s hand as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me mix up the
medicine first.” Ning waved his hand, producing the white jade
bottle and a gourd. He pulled the stoppers out from the gourd and the
jade bottle. The gourd was a magic treasure meant for the express
purpose of holding wine. It wasn’t that precious, merely an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure; Daofathers were capable of casually
manufacturing such items. A suctioning power appeared within the
mouth of the gourd, pulling all of the medicine within the jade
bottle into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mix up the
medicine?” Yu Wei was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Later, we’ll
give this antidote to our three thousand Celestial Immortals and
three hundred thousand Loose Immortals to ingest,” Ning said with a
laugh. “You need to ingest it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ingest this
antidote? Why?” Yu Wei asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Can’t
you guess? Senior apprentice-sister, Human Emperor Shennong is a
master of medicine. In terms of creating Immortal medicines, no one
in the entire Three Realms can compare to him. Once this medicine is
released, all Immortals within ten thousand kilometers will have
their energy completely frozen and unusable. They’ll be like
ordinary mortals. Tell me…if this is suddenly used on the
battlefield, what will happen to the Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that
amazing?” Yu Wei nodded slowly in amazement. “If that happens,
the Seamless Gate will lose disastrously. But junior
apprentice-brother…the Seamless Gate supposedly has formidable
intelligence networks at their fingers. Can it be that they don’t
know and aren’t prepared?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given their
intelligence networks, they probably already know.” Ning shook his
head. “But this is an open scheme, not a hidden one. If they
assault me en masse, I’ll release the Immortal medicine and wipe
them all out. If they don’t…given the power of my Darknorth army,
I can break then down one at a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded gently.
“This truly is an open scheme. They know you have the Immortal
poison, but without the antidote, there’s nothing the Seamless Gate
can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Human Emperor
truly is incredible.” Ning let out a sigh. “He’s actually able
to manufacturing such an incredible Immortal medicine as this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slosh, slosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning picked up the
wine-gourd and gave it a good shake, listening to the sound of the
wine sloshing around within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The medicine’s
been mixed in.” Ning smiled as he looked at Yu Wei. “Want to be
the first one to use it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush.” Yu Wei
said with curiosity, “What does this Immortal medicine look like?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “The
antidote? It was in this white jade bottle, while the poison is in
this black jade bottle.” Waving his hand, Ning produced the black
jade bottle as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Yu Wei
reached out for it. “Let me take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. For
a brief moment, he wanted to refuse…but it was just a brief moment
and a brief thought. He didn’t actually refuse or stop her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful with it,
senior apprentice-sister,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Yu Wei
held the black jade bottle in her hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Violetdawn Pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s incarnation
was here, alongside Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Her
daughter, Brightmoon, continued to kneel there. She stared wide-eyed
at Yu Wei. “I know I was wrong. Can you plead with Father on my
behalf? Ask him not to be angry with me. I really know I was wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s incarnation
walked over to her daughter’s side, kneeling down next to her and
gently embracing her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon was
startled…and then she happily inhaled deeply, smelling of her
mother’s scent. “Mother, you smell so nice. Brightmoon loves it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to be a
good girl. In the future, don’t make your father angry,
understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. I really know
that I made a mistake this time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I know you are a
good girl, Brightmoon. The best girl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s incarnation
held Brightmoon in her arms. Suddenly…her tears began to fall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry. I’m
so sorry.” Yu Wei’s incarnation held Brightmoon in her arms,
while the confused Brightmoon raised her head to look at her mother
puzzledly. Yu Wei just looked back at her, as though wanting to
firmly engrave the memory of her daughter into her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She dissipated like a
mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother?”
Brightmoon hurriedly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Whitepole Commandery. Within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity,
hovering in midair. Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s slender,
pale fingers held the black jade bottle as she looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She still remembered
the first time she had met this junior apprentice-brother of hers…it
was back when Ning had first entered the Black-White College. During
the Dao Debates at the Black-White College, Ning had repeatedly
overcome all challengers in an absolutely dazzling fashion, causing
Yu Wei to become intrigued. She thus personally challenged Ning to a
duel. Perhaps…even as far as back then, she had subconsciously
wanted to leave Ning with an impression of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That trip to the
Witchriver Immortal Estate…she had watched as Ning and Ninelotus
had parted ways, watched as Ning had left all by himself…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Brightmoon
Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers…she had experienced life and
death by his side. She had protected him, and he had protected her.
Their hearts had grown closer, and when she suddenly was faced with
life-threatening danger, he had finally charged forward and taken her
into his arms. Faced with his embrace, she could no longer hold back.
Even though she was a member of the Seamless Alliance, she swore an
oath to herself to never, ever hurt him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later on, she had
returned from her tutelage under Patriarch Lu, and Ning had come back
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, they were
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Be it her past life or
her present life…these days were the happiest days she had ever
experienced. They had viewed flowers together, watched the moon
together, and their two hearts were like one…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She would stroke her
belly, watching as her junior apprentice-brother practiced with the
sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She would prepare
delicacies as she waited for her junior apprentice-brother to return…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And finally…finally!
Their daughter was safely born into the world. Although the Godking
had issued the order soon afterwards, at least the two of them had
been given some time together, and at least they now had a child
together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was enough. These
happy days had been the most blissful, joyful days she had ever
experienced, in this life or the previous one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only…she truly felt
sorry towards her junior apprentice-brother, towards their daughter…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of thoughts,
countless emotions…they all flashed through her mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
within the Violetdawn Pearl’s world, Yu Wei’s incarnation was
tightly holding her daughter in her arms as tears began to cascade
from her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRACK!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slender, white,
dainty fingers…shattered the black jade bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been in a
superb mood. The sound of the shattering jade bottle was like an
explosion that rang out against his very soul. He stared at the
already-shattered black jade bottle in disbelief. How…how could…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silently and
soundlessly, Shennong’s medicine that had been contained within the
black jade bottle began to immediately spread outwards in every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei were
the first to be affected by it. The Immortal energy within their
bodies was instantly congealed, giving them no way to activate it at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost instantly, all
of the Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals within the Darknorth
army camp felt their bodies turn soft. Their Immortal energy became
completely unusable, and the light, airy feeling of grace they
usually felt was gone as well. They were like completely ordinary
mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong’s medicine
quickly began to spread out in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It spread out to cover
an area of ten thousand kilometers…and in truth, the entire Eight
Dragons Cloudcity was only ten thousand kilometers in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SHIT!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A furious roar rang
out, echoing throughout the entire Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Daofather
Crimsonbright’s voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a surge of
powerful energy swept out and encompassed the city, immediately
curtailing the spread of Shennong’s medicine and causing it to
remain where it was. However…although Daofather Crimsonbright had
reacted quite quickly, a terrifying number of Celestial Immortals and
Loose Immortals had been afflicted. The poison had spread far, far
beyond the confines of the Darknorth army camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stared
disbelievingly at his senior apprentice-sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Dao-heart was
strong…but no matter how strong it was, Ning was still thrust into
a state of terror and absolute disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the most
terrifying of demonheart tribulations would have been capable of
throwing Ning into a state of despair like he currently felt. When
the black jade bottle had been shattered, Ning had instantly
realized, but…his realization only caused him utter terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked at Yu
Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met in
midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It became a moment
eternal, a memory eternal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
endless love and affection contained within his senior
apprentice-sister’s eyes, could sense how absolutely unwilling she
was to part from him. He could sense that her love for him in this
moment was so deep, it was etched into her very bones, into her very
soul. He could also sense something else in her gaze…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry.” Yu
Wei said these words softly. She just looked at Ning, as though she
wanted to completely memorize his appearance and imprint it into the
deepest parts of her soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind blows…the
sand flies…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s immediately
body began to break apart and collapse, as though it was being
transformed into tiny granules of sand. It was like a tiny flame
being extinguished. In the instant that she had shattered the black
jade bottle, she had unhesitatingly chosen to end her life as well.
Her Celestial Immortal Jindan had already completely collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a wind blew
past…and she was like smoke being blown away by the wind,
completely vanishing from the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out with
his hands, wanting to catch something…but there was nothing to
catch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stood there
stupidly, arms stretched out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His inability to use
his Immortal energy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that the
destruction of Shennong’s medicine would influence the entire
Realmwar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that they
might lose this Realmwar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of these thoughts
entered Ning’s mind at all…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He just stared blankly
at the spot where his senior apprentice-sister had been sitting. Just
now, a moment ago, she had been sitting there. She had prepared
Immortal wine for him, had smiled merrily at him, just as she had
always done whenever he had returned from those many battles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all gone now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no one seated
on that chair. It was empty…as though Yu Wei had never been there,
had never existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her soul’s gone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all gone…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning mumbled to
himself, “Gone…she’s gone…gone forever…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did it have to
be like this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father and Mother
are gone. Now, she’s gone as well.” Ning just sat there woodenly.
It was though he had lost his soul. He just stared blankly at the
place where she had sat. Just moments ago, she had sat there. She had
smiled at him, a smile that had made Ning feel so warm, so blissful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure appeared out
of nowhere. It was the utterly enraged Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
continued to sit there, staring at the place where she had sat.
Staring at the place where she had been…

Chapter 47 - Shennong And Subhuti
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
stared at the Immortal wine, drinking instruments, and shattered
pieces of black jade that were on the table. He then looked towards
the numb, unmoving Ji Ning. The look in Ning’s eyes caused
Daofather Crimsonbright to shake his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh!” He
flourished his sleeves and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Daofather
Crimsonbright was leaving the room, the Xia Emperor came in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity was the Xia Emperor’s treasure. Thus, he was the second
to find out about what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” The Xia
Emperor called out repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost…we lost.”
Daofather Crimsonbright shook his head and sighed. “Our
Crimsonbright Realm has already suffered heavy casualties during this
Realmwar. I had thought that with Human Emperor Shennong’s help, we
would be able to win, but…who would’ve thought that Ji Ning’s
Dao-companion, Yu Wei, a disciple of Lu Dongbin…was actually a spy
for the Seamless Gate as well. All our plans have come to nothing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t we have
another bottle of Shennong’s medicine?” The Xia Emperor asked
frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless.”
Daofather Crimsonbright sighed. “Those Empyrean God golems of the
Seamless Gate require a hundred Celestial Immortals, but the
Daofather golem only requires a single Pure Yang True Immortal. This
is because the core formation-diagrams of the Daofather golem can be
powered by essence chaostones. The power of the essence chaostones
can be converted directly into the power of primordial chaos, giving
the Daofather golem endless amounts of power. The Daofather golem,
however, is protected by layers of defenses. Even if I were to
personally intervene, I wouldn’t be able to penetrate it. Not with
a coresense attack, not with any other attacks. Shennong’s medicine
is unable to penetrate the Daofather golem as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that Ji Ning’s
portion of the medicine is gone, leaving only one portion behind…the
Daofather golem of the Seamless Gate will completely focus on the
holder of that portion. When it strikes, the rest of us will be
completely unable to keep that portion safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
felt quite resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t we split up
that portion into two smaller portions?” The Xia Emperor asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you take it
for? It’s a perfect, complete concoction; you can’t just split it
up. Its power comes from its perfection and its completeness.”
Daofather Crimsonbright shook his head. “If it could be split
apart, I would’ve split it into a hundred parts long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there really
nothing left to us?” The Xia Emperor simply couldn’t accept this.
He truly could not. The world of the Grand Xia which he had commanded
and toiled over for countless years…the homeland of his Xiamang
clan…it was now gone, just like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing
left.” Daofather Crimsonbright shook his head. “Our only choice
is to seek out Human Emperor Shennong once more and see if he has any
ideas. However, the Human Emperor has already done much for us.
Alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The antidote is with
Ji Ning. Go and spread it out to the others. Rescue the Pure Yang
True Immortals and Celestial Immortals first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Xia
Emperor nodded, then hurriedly said, “Master, don’t take your
anger out on Ji Ning. I saw him through the door just now. He’s
completely dazed by this blow. His Dao-companion was actually a spy
that had been inserted by the Seamless Gate. This has been a
tremendous mental blow to him. His most beloved Dao-companion was a
spy, an enemy…” The Xia Emperor sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I won’t
take it out on him. Yu Wei was a spy, but Ji Ning is one of our
warriors.” Daofather Crimsonbright turned his head to stare through
the doorway as well, looking at Ji Ning. “I hope that this won’t
do too much lasting damage to him. Snowdance was killed by the person
she loved. While Ji Ning didn’t die…I imagine the amount of pain
he feels right now isn’t much less than the amount which Snowdance
felt. Help out and ensure that others don’t come here to berate him
either. He’s only trained for a short period of time, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the Xia
Emperor acknowledged respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Yu Wei was a
traitor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She actually harmed
so many fellow Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pity our fellow
Daoist Darknorth…his most beloved Dao-companion was actually an
enemy spy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning
character really is an idiot. This was a critical moment, and
Shennong’s medicine was so absolutely precious to us…how could he
be so careless?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, all the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity learned of
this matter. They all found it hard to accept this outcome, and some
even were furious with Ning. Most of them, however, felt pity for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, it’s
best if you don’t bother Ji Ning.” The Xia Emperor prevented many
from going in to speak to Ning. Only those who had extremely close
relationships with Ning were allowed to go in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Dongyan
came as well. He just stood outside the door, looking at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For something like
this to happen to him…” True Immortal Dongyan let out a soft
sigh. “However…based on what I know, generally speaking when the
spies of the Seamless Gate reveal themselves, they will go berserk
and show no mercy at all. Yu Wei actually didn’t kill Ji Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter.
Yu Wei’s dead now.” The Xia Emperor nodded. “Ji Ning is
definitely going to hate the Seamless Gate even more now. The
Seamless Gate…they truly are willing to make use of anything and
anyone. They truly will stoop to nothing at all. They all deserve to
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the skies of the
Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An azure-robed figure
with an Immortal sword on his back stood there, gazing at the distant
Eight Dragons Cloudcity, his eyes filled with grief and pain. He let
out a soft sigh. “Foolish child.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She always kept
everything hidden away. Although I could tell that she was hiding
something, I didn’t imagine that she was actually a spy for the
Seamless Gate. But…she’s not a bad person by nature.” Grief and
pain were apparent in Lu Dongbin’s eyes. “Given how much trust
Ning placed in her over the years, she could’ve slain him long ago.
And in the end…she only destroyed the black jade bottle. She didn’t
hurt Ji Ning at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She shattered her
own soul?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She would rather
shatter her own soul than let it return to the Seamless Gate?” Lu
Dongbin shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking of the
Seamless Gate was capable of forcibly carrying off the souls of those
he had imprinted…but Yu Wei had instead chosen to shatter her own
soul than to let that happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why she
decided to shatter that black jade bottle was probably to repay the
Godking for his ‘benevolence’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard long ago
that the Seamless Gate has many spies, all of whom are extremely
devoted to their Godking and willing to die for him if needed. He
truly lives up to his reputation as the disciple of the Lord of the
Demonheart…his ability to manipulate the hearts of men is indeed
impressive. That foolish child shattered the jade black bottle to
repay the Godking. As for suicide…she didn’t want to cause Ji
Ning any more problems in the future?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin loved to
roam the mortal worlds, and had seen many scenes of grief, joy,
parting, and gathering. He naturally understood what Yu Wei was
thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She…was simply a
silly girl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had truly believed
that the Godking had been extremely kind and benevolent towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the Godking, she
was nothing more than a slave, a weapon.” Lu Dongbin shook his
head. “But Ji Ning…alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin felt
helpless as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was indeed a
peerless talent. The storm had just barely begun, but he had already
started shine and dazzle…but now, the person he cared about the
most had died and left him. This blow…there was nothing Lu Dongbin
could do to soften it. The only person who could help Ji Ning right
now was Ji Ning himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Three
Realms. At the end of the vast Void, there was the even-vaster
primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the primordial
chaos, all things were possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the primordial
chaos that had given birth to many powerful Fiendgods, to Pangu, to
Nuwa, to the Ancestor Dragon, to the Phoenix, to the Torch Dragon, to
Daoist Threelives, to Subhuti, to Crimsonbright…to all of them. The
most powerful Fiendgod, Pangu, had established Heaven and Earth,
creating the utterly massive Pangu’s Primordial World and perishing
after his labors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If yet another
Pangu-like presence was born, he would absolutely be capable of
establishing yet another world within the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was truly infinite and limitless, after all…after Mother Nuwa had
entered the primordial chaos, she had never returned from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an area in the
primordial chaos that was very close to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a medicine
field within the primordial chaos, and next to it was a thatched
cottage. Two people were seated by the side of the cottage. One was
the white-bearded Patriarch Subhuti, while the other was dressed in
plain clothes and had unkempt hair and a tousled beard. He looked
like an old farmer…but his eyes contained eternity within them, an
ancientness that brought peace to the hearts of those who saw him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He…was one of the
Three Emperors of Mankind. Shennong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the Three Emperors,
Suiren was the most ancient, while Fuxi was always dressed in his
Eight Trigram robes. Both had extraordinary appearances. Only
Shennong dressed very simply, as though he was naught but an old
farmer toiling away in his fields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This event is most
likely going to cast a shadow over your disciple’s heart.”
Shennong personally poured Subhuti a cup of tea. The tea bubbled and
hissed, but it emanated a soothing, intoxicating fragrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate’s
subterfuge abilities are indeed unparalleled. There’s no way to
investigate them at all.” Subhuti shook his head. “I’ve been
thinking carefully about Yu Wei’s past life and present life. I
think it must be due to the fact that she suffered too much in her
past life. She transformed into a demon and massacred countless
people. In the midst of her massacres, she was probably influenced by
Demonheart. She was naturally guided towards their side, and in the
end became a chess piece for their ‘Godking’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Shennong
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that they knew for
a fact that Yu Wei was a spy, it wasn’t too hard for them to spot
the reason as to why she had joined the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if they didn’t
already know this, there was no way to find out. There were far, far
too many Immortal cultivators who descended into madness and
slaughter, after all. Some might have become truly filled with
bloodlust and the desire to kill, while others had been driven crazy
by the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations. There was no way to
tell on the surface, no way at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This
time…Crimsonbright is going to lose.” Shennong shook his head. “I
just finished creating those two portions of Immortal medicine. Both
were created using some unique herbs that I located in the primordial
chaos that are incredibly rare. I can grow more of those herbs in my
farm…but even if I change the flow of time to make them grow
faster, I’ll still need at least another century before I can
finish another batch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Crimsonbright
loses, he’ll naturally lead his army away from the Grand Xia. This
disciple of yours…what are you planning to do about him?”
Shennong asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither side had
reached the point of entering a truly life-and-death struggle against
the other yet. Both sides could easily retreat if they chose to. They
could simply tear a hole through space and easily leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has the
[Starseizing Hand] of Threelives, and he’s quite talented in
heartforce as well. I feel, however, that his talent with the sword
is even higher.” Subhuti sighed. “He absolutely has the potential
to become yet another ‘Houyi’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi?” Shennong
gently nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was someone who,
as an Empyrean God, had slain a Daofather! He was an absolute legend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this truly was a
heavy blow for him. Still…fortune and disaster ride together.
Perhaps this will serve to help him temper his heart.” Patriarch
Subhuti shook his head. “Emotional matters like this…he’ll have
to rely on himself to overcome it. There’s nothing I can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity. Ji Ning’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was finally on his
feet. He began to collect the table, the Immortal wine, and the
drinking utensils in an extremely careful manner. He even picked up
all the shattered pieces of black jade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighth brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Unity, Allbeasts, Whacko, and the others had all arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let yourself
hurt too much.” Celestial Immortal Allbeasts patted Ning on the
shoulder and said, “Something like this is completely
unpredictable. Since Yu Wei was a spy…then you should just forget
about her, eighth brother. Don’t let this misery and unhappiness
fester away in your heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget her,”
Celestial Immortal Whacko exhorted softly as well. “When Thousand
Needles died, I felt so much pain that I wanted to die…but what can
you do? We have to look forward, move forward. Forget her. It’ll
make things easier for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
look at Whacko. His voice was slightly hoarse. “Seventh
brother…have you been able to forget her?”
</P>

Chapter 48 - Ji Ning And The Godking
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whacko was stunned. For
a moment, he couldn’t say a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you can go
back now. Let me be by myself for a while,” Ning said, then began
to walk towards a nearby private room. This was the private room
which Yu Wei had designed for him back when they had first arrived
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Allbeasts, Rainsoar, Unity, and the others all watched as Ning walked
away, then exchanged glances with each other. There was nothing they
could do. They left the house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The private room was
very simple, as were the prayer mats and the incense burners…but Yu
Wei had personally laid out this room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the room
with his gaze. He felt as though he could see Yu Wei decorating the
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister,” Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He then sat down in the
lotus position by himself, closing his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His thoughts were a
complete mess. The countless scenes of him being together with Yu Wei
flooded his mind, and he couldn’t help but repeatedly grimace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A profound, arcane sort
of ripple that came from another level of existence brushed past
Ning. Not even Daofather Crimsonbright could detect this ripple. As
it brushed past Ning, a powerful desire to sleep quickly filled him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning was
shocked. He was a Pure Yang True Immortal; he wouldn’t be so easily
mesmerized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the Godking of
the Seamless Gate. You should know of me.” A voice rang out in
Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Ning’s
mind was filled with boundless hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having fought for
so long, Ning had naturally engaged the Xia Emperor and the others in
conversation. He knew, of course, that the true supreme commander of
the Seamless Gate was the Godking. The Nuwa Alliance had learned long
ago that the Godking was able to control the world of dreams, was
capable of meeting others in their dreams. The Nuwa Alliance,
however, was unable to counter this ability of his; they were
completely unable to penetrate the dreamworlds which the Godking
created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to guide
a strand of your thoughts into my world. Let us converse,” the
Godking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning didn’t
refuse. He was within the Eight Dragons Cloudcity; he wouldn’t be
in much danger at all. Just a strand of his thoughts…even if that
strand was severed, it wouldn’t be much of a loss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning allowed a strand
of his mind to be guided downwards, downwards into the abyss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast world of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gigantic throne that
was thirty thousand meters high was levitating in midair. The Godking
was seated on his throne, and before him appeared the figure of Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
glance coldly at the black-robed figure in midair. The aura around
the black robes caused the Godking to seem exceptionally inscrutable
and mysterious. Ning said coldly, “Why has an exalted Daofather
such as yourself come to seek me out?” Although his heart was
filled with boundless hatred, enough hatred to cause an ordinary
mortal to go insane…Ning knew very well that the difference in
power between himself and the supreme commander of the Seamless
Alliance was too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to feel such
hatred for me.” The Godking sat up high on his throne as he spoke
calmly to Ji Ning. “We are enemies, after all; the actions I took,
I took to guarantee that the Seamless Gate would win. I’ve come to
you…because I wish for you to join the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Idiocy.” This was
the only word Ning said. He couldn’t even be bothered to say more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think…that
Yu Wei is dead?” The Godking asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning stared
at the Godking. “I personally watched as my senior
apprentice-sister’s soul was shattered. How could she not be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, her soul was
shattered…but she didn’t die.” Amusement could be heard within
the Godking’s voice. “After her soul was shattered, her truesoul
would’ve headed straight towards the River of Destiny, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say
anything. This was indeed true. Even if Yu Wei’s soul was
shattered…if one could locate Yu Wei’s truesoul within the River
of Destiny, the truesoul could be used to bring her back to life once
more! However, to find a truesoul within the River of Destiny…based
on what Ning knew, the only one in the entire Three Realms capable of
this was Mother Nuwa. Mother Nuwa, however, had long ago entered the
infinite primordial chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei was one of
the many spies I sent to infiltrate the Nuwa Alliance,” the Godking
said. “Of the many spies, some were absolutely and unwaveringly
loyal to me. They obey all my orders and commands, and are willing to
die for me. These true believers…I long ago left behind my imprint
upon their souls.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pupils
contracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei committed
suicide, shattering her soul…but thanks to the imprint I left
behind on it, I knew right away what she had done,” the Godking
said. “Thus, as her soul was shattering, I immediately reached out
to latch onto her truesoul, taking it away. Her truesoul isn’t in
the River of Destiny at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart began to
quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After taking away
her truesoul, I sent it to be reincarnated within a lesser cycle of
reincarnation which I set up,” the Godking said. Ning knew that
most Daofathers were capable of setting up a lesser cycle of
reincarnation; Daofather Crimsonbright himself had done such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once a truesoul entered
the cycle of reincarnation, it would naturally be reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Celestial
Immortals and True Immortals were reborn, it was generally their
truesouls which were reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After she was
reborn, I immediately awakened her memories and captured her young
soul. Take…a close look.” The Godking pointed with one finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, roughly a
hundred meters to the right of Ji Ning, a black-robed maiden appeared
out of thin air. Her appearance…her aura…her eyes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister?” Ning couldn’t believe it…but he knew it to
be true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some things could be
imitated, but the look in one’s eyes could not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, she cannot
hear you or see you. Just stand there and watch,” the Godking’s
voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, Godking.” Yu Wei had a somewhat stunned look her face as
she fell to her knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei…did you
think that if you committed suicide, your soul would be destroyed?”
The Godking’s voice held a hint of wrath within it. “I told you
that once you were prepared to destroy Shennong’s medicine, you
were to first touch the imprint I left upon your soul, and I would
rescue it right away. Why did you choose to commit suicide? If I was
just slightly slower, your truesoul would’ve entered the River of
Destiny, never to be found again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei remained there
on her knees. “Godking, please grant me death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grant you death?”
The Godking said coldly, “What, are you afraid that if you remain
alive, you’ll bring Ji Ning more trouble?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kneeling Yu Wei
didn’t move at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You truly are quite
loyal to this Ji Ning of yours. Long ago, when I ordered you to take
him to the Fifth World, you refused. And now, you would rather die
than become a chess piece our Seamless Gate can use to influence him.
You truly disappoint me.” The Godking was rather angry now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei remained on her
knees, her tears cascading downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She truly was very
devoted to the Godking. She couldn’t help but feel miserable upon
hearing that the Godking was disappointed in her…but she truly
didn’t wish to become a burden to Ji Ning or her daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Godking
blew towards her, and a wind arose that swept her away, causing her
to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning was shocked. That definitely had been his
senior apprentice-sister; there was no mistaking it at all. That look
in her eyes…there was definitely no mistaking it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic.”
The Godking looked towards Ning. “Your Dao-companion’s soul is
fine. Only a sliver of her mind was within this dreamworld of mine.
Now that her truesoul has been reborn, her new soul is incredibly
weak. She isn’t even capable of committing suicide. Her fate…is
now completely in your hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My hands?” Ning’s
face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” The
Godking’s dark, misty eyes seemed to flash with lightning. “Your
hands. If you join our Seamless Gate, then I can let you once more
reunite with your beloved Dao-companion and live together in bliss.
Under the Seamless Gate’s protection…not even your master,
Daofather Subhuti, would be able to kill you. In addition, your
master most likely wouldn’t be willing to violate our unspoken
accord and personally act to kill you. He is a Daofather, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you join our
Seamless Gate, then you, your Dao-companion Yu Wei, and your
child…all of you will be able to live together in bliss. You will
also receive our protection!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if you do not
join us…the soul of your Dao-companion Yu Wei shall suffer endless,
inescapable torment within my Infinity Hells. As for you and your
child…you shall remain enemies of the Seamless Gate, forever
suffering our assaults.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking looked at
Ning. “I trust you know which choice you should make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take another look.”
The Godking pointed sideways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A painting appeared out
of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the painting
of a vast world, a world of flames, of mountains of blades, of lakes
of burning oil, of forests of swords, of implements of torture. Many
souls were here, undergoing countless torments and punishments. A
black-robed maiden had been teleported here as well. Upon seeing the
Infinity Hells, upon seeing the despair and misery of those countless
souls…the look on her face couldn’t help but change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But moments later, Yu
Wei calmed down. She had guessed long ago that she would probably be
sent to the Godking’s Infinity Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
Infinity Hells, a place I created. It’s an even more painful place
than the eighteen layer of Hell of the Netherworld Kingdom.” The
Godking looked at Ning. “If you are the enemy of the Seamless
Gate…then Yu Wei will no longer be of use to me. Thus, she should
prepare herself to suffer endless, infinite torture within the
Infinity Hells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She was so loyal to
you!” Ning couldn’t help but snap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loyal?” The
Godking shook his head. “No. If she was loyal to me…you would’ve
died long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself could sense
how badly the Seamless Gate wished to kill him. The three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater, for example, had always been hovering
around him. Before that, the Seamless Gate had actually sent out a
squad to assassinate him. Fortunately, Old Man Yuan had intervened.
If Yu Wei had wanted him dead…given his absolute faith in her, he
would’ve died long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She violated my
orders,” the Godking said. “Given my temper…I should’ve cast
her into the Infinity Hells long ago, letting her suffer endless
torment. However, she was the disciple of Lu Dongbin and your
Dao-companion. It is hard to find someone like her, and so I showed
her clemency.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when Yu Wei
had refused the Godking’s commands all those years ago, she had
already mentally prepared herself for death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That time, the Godking
had shown clemency…which was why Yu Wei had wanted to give Ning a
child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, she should
have started to suffer this sort of torture long ago. To violate my
orders? The only result can be death.” The Godking looked towards
Ning. “But Ji Ning, your talent is truly remarkable; you are
qualified to me to reconsider. The Seamless Gate views you as being
very important…and so if you can join us, Yu Wei will immediately
be spared her eternal torment. She’ll even be allowed to accompany
you and your child. The three of you will be able to live together
with each other forever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking truly
wished to be able to pull Ji Ning to his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was a
tremendous threat, true. But if they could recruit him…the Seamless
Gate would’ve gained yet another helper, while the Nuwa Alliance
would’ve lost one of their peerless talents. This was a result that
was much better than merely killing Ji Ning. As for Yu Wei…she was
the tool which the Seamless Gate was relying on to make this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join our Seamless
Gate. We have treasures, divine abilities, golems…everything. You,
your child, and your Dao-companion will be able to join together once
more.” The Godking pointed towards the midair images. “I trust
you won’t consigned the woman you love into the Infinity Hells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He just stood there,
looking at the image of his senior apprentice-sister, Yu Wei. He just
silently stood there.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 49 - The Choice
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had never
doubted Yu Wei’s love for him. When the two had been together, he
had been able to truly sense her heart. His parents had passed away,
but she had let him once more feel warmth in his heart. It was
something which surpassed simple love; only when love reached a truly
deep level would it bring this sort of warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were others that
Ning could never forget.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it hadn’t been for
Daoist Threelives’ legacy, he probably would’ve died long ago
when he was weak!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it wasn’t for the
seven mighty Empyrean Gods, he would’ve perished long ago!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it wasn’t for his
master Subhuti, he would’ve lost his life in the Nihilum Zone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Immortal
Diancai…his fellow disciple, Mu Northson…they were filled with
endless hatred towards the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father…his
mother…their situation was probably even worse than Yu Wei’s.
Their truesouls had already entered the River of Destiny…and with
Mother Nuwa having disappeared into the primordial chaos, the fact
that their souls had been shattered meant that they were essentially
dead and gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To bring Mother Nuwa
back?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To reach Mother Nuwa’s
level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would be very hard!
Even harder than defeating the Seamless Alliance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fog continued to billow
around the Godking’s black robes. He stared downwards at Ji Ning,
awaiting his response. He knew very well that this was perhaps his
best chance of making Ji Ning join the Seamless Gate…because Yu Wei
could be described as the most important person in Ji Ning’s life.
Their souls were tied together…and as the Godking had said, Yu Wei
had chosen to die rather than be a burden to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the disciple of a
Daofather, Ji Ning himself wouldn’t be blamed or directly affected
by a defeat in this Realmwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire vast world
of darkness was deathly still, terrifyingly still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
quietly, staring at the image of his senior apprentice-sister. It
seemed as though he wanted to permanently engrave her appearance in
his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your choice,”
the Godking said. “Don’t try to deceive me. You won’t be able
to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was silent for a
moment. Then, Ning broke his silence and said in a soft voice, “Let
me look at her for a bit longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
instantly enraged!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the fog that was
billowing around the black robes and the massive throne began to roil
about. Visible crackles of lightning could be seen within the fog,
utterly dazzling to behold. The Godking forced down his rage, then
growled, “You have decided to remain enemies with my Seamless Gate?
Your most beloved Dao-companion is about to be exiled into the
Infinity Hells. You have the power to keep her safe and let her be by
your side and your child’s side…but you are now choosing to send
her into Hell, never to be reborn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s every
word stabbed like knives against Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The choice is
yours!” The entire vast world of darkness was shaking. Clearly, the
Godking was almost unable to repress his anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep, boundless pain
could be seen within Ning’s eyes…but he just stood there and
quietly stared at his senior apprentice-sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned, looked at
the Godking, then with a thudding sound respectfully fell to his
knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
instantly delighted. He even left his vast throne and walked
downwards towards Ning. “Hahaha, Ji Ning…this is a wise decision
you have just…” But Ning suddenly spoke out, interrupting the
Godking’s words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, you are an
exalted Daofather.” Ning remained on his knees. “I know that my
senior apprentice-sister experienced great hardship in her past life,
and I imagine you must have been benevolent towards her. In turn, she
was completely loyal to you, going so far as to destroy Shennong’s
medicine. It can be said that she rendered a major contribution to
the Seamless Gate. I’d like to ask you, Godking, not to bicker with
a poor little girl like her. I wouldn’t dare beg that you send my
senior apprentice-sister back to my side, Godking; all I hope is that
she can live a simple, peaceful life. If you can do this, I will be
endlessly grateful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kneeling Ji Ning’s
voice was filled with supplication.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had already
left his throne and landed on the ground. He was momentarily
stunned…and then he grew even further enraged. He roared furiously,
“Ji Ning!!!! You will be ‘grateful’? ‘Poor little girl’?
This is a WAR!!! You only have two options! If you refuse me, then
she will definitely be sent to suffer endless torment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go! Send Yu Wei to
her justly deserved torments for all eternity. Let her never be
reborn!” The Godking’s furious roar rang out, reverberating
within the Infinity Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, two
black-robed envoys took hold of Yu Wei and sent her to a fiery abyss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to kneel
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.” Ning
looked towards the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only have two
options. Stand by my side…or be my enemy!” The entire world of
darkness was filled with wrath and fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet,
quietly staring at the painting and at the images of his senior
apprentice-sister suffering fiery torment within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He vanished from this
dreamworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!” The Godking
roared with fury, causing the entire world of darkness to shake.
“Damn, damn, DAMN!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your lover will
suffer torment…and you, you will soon die as well! You will DIE!”
The Godking was truly enraged. He truly had wanted to recruit Ji Ning
to his side…but he had actually be refused. He was humiliated,
enraged, and filled with a desire to kill. But the Nuwa Alliance was
very powerful; to kill Ji Ning would be no easy task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the one who
personally consigned her to endless torment within the Infinity
Hells! It was you! You personally!!!” The Godking’s furious roars
reverberated with Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s powerful
coresense struck out against that thought-strand, blasting it apart.
This undetectable method which the Godking was using…although not
even Daofathers could sense it, it didn’t contain much power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Violetdawn Pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaak. Ning’s true
body walked out from his study. Soon, he arrived at the room where
his daughter Brightmoon was being punished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter Brightmoon
was still on her knees, her eyes filled with puzzlement and
confusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” When
Brightmoon saw Ning, she immediately revealed a look of joy. “I was
wrong. I really understand that I was wrong. Don’t be angry,
Father. I’ll never dare to use fire to play with mortals in the
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked to his
daughter’s side, then fell to his knees, quietly taking her into
his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon couldn’t
help but reveal a look of joy as her father took her into his arms.
She comfortably snuggled into Ning’s chest. “Father, don’t be
angry anymore. Ahaha, Mother came a short while ago to hug me as
well…but then she said ‘sorry’. Sorry? I don’t really
understand…but then, Mother disappeared. Father, didn’t you say
that Mother left her incarnation here? Why did her incarnation
suddenly leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So she hadn’t just
said ‘sorry’ to him. She had said ‘sorry’ to their daughter
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father?”
Brightmoon could sense that something was wrong with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to hold
his daughter in his arms. He said in a soft voice, “I’m the one
who should be sorry to your mother.” Ning shut his eyes, his tears
coming out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt so sorry!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Godking
had forced him to make a decision…in the end, he had decided to let
her be sent to the Infinity Hells. Ning felt as though countless ants
were constantly gnawing upon his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt utter agony in
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Misery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ning
hadn’t shed any tears, not even when he had seen her soul be
shattered. He had been delighted to discover that she wasn’t dead,
then instantly had to face a choice that brought despair. He had to
watch as she began to be tortured within the Infinity Hells…but
despite all that, Ning hadn’t shed any tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, as he
held his daughter in his arms, Ning could no longer resist. Finally,
he began to cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hot tears came
cascading down his face, landing on Brightmoon’s body. Brightmoon
was stunned. Raising her head, she looked towards Ning. She saw that
her father…was actually crying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?
Where’s Mother?” Brightmoon was very clever. She immediately
asked this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She died.” Ning
held his daughter in his arms as he responded in a soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Died?” Brightmoon
was stunned. Although she was precocious and intelligent, she was
truly stunned. The only thing she could do was just stupidly stand
there and hug her father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon…in the
future, it’ll just be you and me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to hold
his daughter in his arms. She had just been born…but her mother had
already left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…I’m sorry. I swear…I’ll take good care of
our child. I definitely will.” The only thing and the most
important thing Ning could for his senior apprentice-sister, for
himself, was to take good care of and protect their daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the Seamless
Gate…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His tears continued to
fall, but deep within his eyes, a desire to kill that was even deeper
than the Abyss could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Dragons
Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning emerged from
his room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came out?” The
Xia Emperor looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty, you’ve been here this entire time?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wasn’t
here…do you think you would’ve had such a peaceful time of it?
Countless people have come to speak to you. Some came to console you,
but some came to curse you and berate you.” The Xia Emperor shook
his head. “I can’t blame them. We were on the cusp of winning
this Realmwar, after all, but now…alas. Once this Realmwar is lost,
the worlds and the foundations that these Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals spent countless years cultivating will be taken away by the
Seamless Gate. How can they not be enraged? Still, don’t be angry
with them. After some time passes, they’ll slowly begin to accept
this outcome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards the
Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense that
these words of the Xia Emperor held a hint of frustration and
disappointment within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the war lost, the
Xia Emperor would lose his Grand Xia world. That was the foundation
of his Xiamang clan, a vast world which he had spent his blood and
sweat to build up, ever since he had taken it over during the
Fiendgod Era. How could he not be heartbroken? But the Xia Emperor
didn’t blame Ji Ning; instead, he had stayed outside and prevented
many people from coming in, ensuring that Ji Ning wouldn’t be
disturbed. Ning knew very well that the fact that they had snatched
defeat from the jaws of victory would be very difficult for many of
the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to accept. They would be utterly
enraged and heartbroken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we really going
to lose?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We really are.”
The Xia Emperor sighed, then nodded his head.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Towards The Heavens
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there are
many people who are unwilling to accept this, the difference in power
is too great.” The Xia Emperor shook his head. “The Seamless Gate
has a Daofather golem on their side, while we were going to rely on
Shennong’s medicine to win the battle, but…well, now we shall
simply wait for the Daofather to give us our final orders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s my fault,”
Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t your
fault. You couldn’t have imagined that Yu Wei belongs to the
Seamless Gate. There’s no need for you to overthink things. I’ve
been outside and have prevented quite a few from coming in to bother
you; this was on the Daofather’s personal instructions. The
Daofather still views you as being extremely important.” The Xia
Emperor looked towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
suddenly remembered something. He immediately said, “Right, you
should be unable to use your Immortal energy right now, right? I’ll
give you ten drops of the antidote.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me a hundred,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred?” The
Xia Emperor looked towards Ning with surprise. “You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t explain.
What would be the point of explaining that he had become a Pure Yang
True Immortal? His Heaven Punisher was still at the same level of
power that it always was; it wouldn’t be able to change the outcome
of the battle at all. It was best not to give them any false hopes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Take it.”
The Xia Emperor took out a jade bottle and a large gourd. Drops of
liquid flew out from the gourd and into the jade bottle. After a
hundred drops were absorbed, he handed it to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it, then
began to go towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t that
Commander Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that his
Dao-companion was a spy for the Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I heard the
same. We were at the cusp of victory, but this Ji Ning guy placed too
must faith in his Dao-companion, giving her the chance to destroy
Shennong’s medicine, and our hopes for victory along with it. We’ve
fought for so long…so many of us have died…and it was all for
nothing. Immortal Darknorth was far too careless…and he was far too
trusting of his Dao-companion!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Wangxiu, you go too far! A Dao-companion is the most important
companion anyone will have on their Immortal path. Both
Dao-companions will support each other and assist each other. How
many would be suspicious of their Dao-companions? If they were, they
wouldn’t have become Dao-companions to begin with!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Poor Immortal
Darknorth, to be betrayed by his Dao-companion like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, poor bastard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning walked through
the Eight Dragons Cloudcity and passed by the various military camps,
the various Immortals within those camps all looked at Ning and
whispered amongst themselves. With the story being told and retold,
the truth had long since become rather blurred…but the countless
Immortals and Fiendgods continued to discuss it, as this was what had
caused them to lose this entire Realmwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that Yu Wei
took advantage of Immortal Darknorth’s trust to destroy Shennong’s
medicine. Immortal Darknorth was so enraged and hearbroken that he
personally wiped out Yu Wei, shattering her very soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, I heard the
same, that Immortal Darknorth personally killed that traitor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all that
damned traitor’s fault.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning continued to
walk through the city, his ears began to twitch and a hint of grief
appeared in his eyes. He knew that once the story began to spread,
this would become a popular version. He hadn’t killed his senior
apprentice-sister; she had shattered her own soul, because she no
longer wanted to be under the control of the Seamless Gate. But now,
she was suffering endless torment and torture within the Infinity
Hells. Although it was the Godking who was doing this…it was true
that Ning had decided to leave her there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking for a
long time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning arrived at the
city walls of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity. He sat down atop the city
walls, all by his lonesome as he quietly stared at the utterly
devastated battlefield beyond the walls. He also saw the vast, dark
citadel of the Seamless City, hovering in the sky in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless City. The
Eight Dragons Cloudcity. They continued to face each other.
Clearly…this great war hadn’t truly ended yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” As soon
as True Immortal Dongyan walked out from his palace, he could see
that that solitary figure seated atop the city walls. He could sense
how withered, how haggard Ji Ning was right now. He didn’t have the
boundless vitality that he had in the past. In the past, Ji Ning
always had a smile on his face, and his eyes were always bright.
Right now, however…Ji Ning was like a mountain glacier that had
been built up over thousands of years, filled with an infinitely cold
and desolate aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is man of
deep emotions, and he cares deeply about love.” Someone else walked
to Dongyan’s side; it was True Immortal Cloudust, who let out a
sigh. “This word, ‘love’…it is absolutely ravaging.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” True
Immortal Dongyan nodded. “To be betrayed by his most beloved
Dao-companion…a blow like this…ugh, there’s nothing we can do
to help him. Right, fellow Daoist Cloudust…is there any chance left
for our Crimsonbright Realm to win?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Cloudust
was the follower of Human Emperor Shennong; he should have access to
detailed intelligence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Cloudust
shook his head. “There’s almost no hope. Given the current state
of the battle…the only chance we have is if we summon some of the
most famous and powerful Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the
Three Realms. But these figures are needed everywhere, either to cow
certain enemies or to deal with major threats. If we send them here,
it’ll have an impact on our force disposition across the entire
Three Realms. In the end, the Crimsonbright Realm is just one of the
weaker Realms, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is a bit weak…but
we’ve been fighting for years and have suffered countless
casualties.” True Immortal Dongyan didn’t want to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals of the Crimsonbright Realm naturally felt
strong ties towards their homeland. Nobody wanted for their homeland
to be occupied by the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, just wait.
The Daofather has already gone to speak with the Human Emperor.”
True Immortal Cloudust continued, “Let’s see if the Human Emperor
has any ideas…but my feeling is that if the Human Emperor had any
ideas, he would’ve reached out long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Dongyan
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…if Shennong’s
medicine hadn’t been destroyed…if Ji Ning hadn’t given it to Yu
Wei…” True Immortal Cloudust sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Dongyan
sighed and shook his head. “Ji Ning trusted his Dao-companion too
much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the current state
of the war, almost all of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the
Grand Xia had lost their hope. Quite a few of them had been so
furious with Ji Ning as to curse him aloud, but slowly they all began
to calm down. They no longer blamed Ji Ning…because they knew that
Ji Ning himself certainly hadn’t hoped for this to happen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’s Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still there
atop the walls.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been days. He
hasn’t even moved from the walls at all. I wonder what he’s
looking at?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Human Emperor
has already sent word. There’s nothing he can do. That medicine is
too difficult to create; even the Human Emperor was only able to send
some more of the antidote over to allow our Immortals to recover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Human Emperor
has given up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
given up…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My brothers all died
in battle…was it all for nothing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Skysong clan’s
Heaven Punisher was destroyed. We had twelve Celestial Immortals in
our ranks, but I was the only one lucky enough to survive. I had
thought that after our grand victory, I would spend some time having
our clan rest and rebuild. But now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain. Heartbreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimsonbright Realm
was their home. Their foundation. The place where countless
generations of their clan members had toiled over, shedding blood and
sweat. They were willing to die for their homeland; they were even
willing to accept the deaths of their brothers, masters, and
disciples if it meant winning this battle. It would all be worth it!
But…they weren’t going to be able to win. They were going to
lose!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was by himself
atop the city walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
red-haired Empyrean God Redsnow had arrived. He gently patted Ning on
the shoulders. “Bestir yourself. This is nothing more than one of
many pitfalls you shall encounter on your Immortal path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you move past
it…you will see that the seas and the skies remain as vast as they
ever were.” Empyrean God Redsnow looked at Ning, hope in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just give me a
little more time to think things over,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Empyrean
God Redsnow didn’t try to force things. He knew very well what sort
of a person Ji Ning was. That was why he liked Ji Ning so much,
supporting him and believing him to be the most suitable successor to
the Starseizing Manor! Only a man who cared deeply about
relationships would win the trust of his comrades. Selfish
individuals like Sword Immortal Evergreen…how many would truly be
willing to trust and befriend him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, people who
cared deeply about relationships would also be deeply wounded by
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, even some of
the major powers of the Three Realms had been deeply wounded in their
relationships…and despite the passage of countless eras, they
remained unable to truly heal from those wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow
left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move past it?”
Ning murmured to himself, “How can I move past it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had felt
tremendous despair when he saw Yu Wei die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now that he knew
that Yu Wei wasn’t dead…he was momentarily overjoyed, then forced
to make a choice. He had chosen to personally consign Yu Wei to the
Infinity Hells. This caused Ning to feel even greater heartbreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his body
remained in the mortal world, his heart had already entered Hell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Guilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wanted to force
them all down, to suppress them, to move past it all…but how could
he possibly suppress them all?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I confidently viewed
myself as a favored son of heaven, as a formidably talented figure.
But I was wrong. I was wrong. She’s now suffering endless torment
in the Infinity Hells, but there’s nothing I can do. Not a damn
thing.” Ning stared at the desolate landscape, which had long ago
become utterly ruined and ravaged by the wars between the Immortals
and Fiendgods. “I’m just like this landscape here. Like the grass
atop the ground. In the face of the Immortals and Fiendgods who do
battle…the only thing the grass can do is be trampled upon and
destroyed, because it can’t fight back at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still puny and
weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidably talented?
No matter how talented I am, it will be a long, long time before I
can possibly be a match for the Godking. In the here and now…I
remain very weak. Faced with the Godking’s power, all I could do
was to let it all happen. I wasn’t able to stop him, to push back
at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The utter despair he
felt…what he witnessed first-hand was what caused it to be etched
into his bones and imprinted into his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking made Ji
Ning choose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had no choice
but to choose!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could only watch as
the Godking sent Yu Wei into the Infinity Hells! The only thing he
could do was to kneel down and hope that he could move the Godking
with his words…but alas, it was useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was powerless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was under
the Godking’s control. The only thing Ning could do was accept it
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the wild
grass atop the ravaged landscape. He felt like he was the grass;
there was nothing he could do but be trampled upon, be broken, be
attacked, be destroyed…the only thing he could do was to accept it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was staring at
the grass vacantly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart suddenly
became completely calm, empty, and ephemeral.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless strands
of grass…the dust…it seemed to spread into Ning’s very heart,
and Ning’s heart itself was expanding as well to accommodate them.
In fact, even the skies themselves seemed to extend into Ning’s
heart. Slowly, the entirety of Whitepole Commandery was contained
within Ning’s heart, which continued to grow and grow…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart was endlessly
vast. As vast as Heaven and Earth, all of which was contained within
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart had
reached out to encompass all 3600 commanderies. In fact, it reached
out to cover even the vast and massive seas. The entire world of the
Grand Xia, protected by the planar membrane, was like a giant oval
spheroid…and the entire vast spheroid had already become one with
Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, his heart was
still trying to continue to expand, to stretch out to the vast,
vacant Void itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a powerful,
innate desire of his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there atop the
city walls. He said softly to himself, “Though I come from the
mortal dust, my heart still soars towards the heavens.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_51___Heartforce__Stage_F"></A>
Chapter 51 - Heartforce, Stage Four
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning wiped the tears
from his eyes. He understood that these were tears of joy, an
uncontrollable joy that had come out upon his heart becoming one with
Heaven in Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So…in the past, I
was wrong, ridiculously wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder the truly
supreme divine archers of the Three Realms are all so low-key.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally understood
the true nature of the fourth stage of heartforce, ‘mortal dust’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like the grass
upon the desolate battlefield…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had to struggle to
emerge from the dirt and grow up. It fought for every ray of
sunshine, every drop of rain, because it wanted to grow higher and
higher. It might be very low-key and unremarkable…but not even the
most exalted major powers of the Three Realms could stop the will and
the heart of the grass. The heart was infinite and unlimited; even a
beggar could have the heart and ambitions of an emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the heart
was invisible and formless…but it was incomparably marvelous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even mortals who had
sufficiently powerful hearts and wills could create miracles. They
would become heroes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Immortal
cultivators…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number in the Three
Realms who were able to reach the fourth stage of heartforce, ‘mortal
dust’, was incredibly low! The number who managed to reach this
fourth stage when at the Empyrean God or True Immortal level could be
counted on one hand. Even amongst the exalted True Gods and
Daofathers, the fourth stage essentially represented an absolute
limit. Only one person had ever broken past this limit…Houyi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was the only
person to ever reach the fifth stage of heartforce, and he even left
behind a systemized technique for training in it. His power was
acclaimed at all, but he had long ago disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
tell how incredibly difficult it was for one to reach the fourth
stage of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m like the wild
grass. I’m nothing more than an unremarkable blade of grass. In the
face of the Godking, in the face of the major powers…I’m
unbelievably weak.” Ning had been seated atop the city walls, but
he now rose to his feet and stared towards the skies. “But I want
to walk further along my path, to make it to greater heights, to
become even more powerful than the Godking. In fact, I want to reach
Pangu and Nuwa’s level…and then surpass them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how lowly
a person might be, his heart is limitless.” Ning felt very moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prajna-states of
enlightenment were profound, arcane, and unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After experiencing so
many setbacks and that agonizing choice…Ning’s heart had indeed
been greatly impacted. But only when he felt as downtrodden as he did
right now did he truly understand what it meant to be as
insignificant as a speck of mortal dust. And so, he slowly began to
understand and gain insights into this stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone knew the
principles of this stage, but to truly understand it and to
thoroughly comprehend it was far, far more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Knowing’ what to
do is easy; it’s the ‘doing’ that is tricky!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s heart had
expanded, his heartforce had risen in power as well. When Ning’s
heart had reached the point of becoming one with the entire world of
the Grand Xia and begun to reach out towards the infinite Void…his
heartforce had truly reached an absolutely terrifying level, a level
which represented an absolute limit for even True Gods and
Daofathers, many of whom had not been able to reach it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage of
heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had broken
through!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the missing
Houyi…Ning’s heartforce could be ranked as the highest within the
entire Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Always consider
yourself as an unremarkable speck of mortal dust. Always reach for
greater heights. Not even reaching Pangu’s level is the end of your
ambitions.” Ning didn’t know whether or not Pangu’s level
represented the endpoint for Immortal cultivation, but there was no
endpoint for the heart. His heart could become infinitely vast,
infinitely great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The difference
between the fourth stage and the third stage is simply far too vast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reaching the third
stage of heartforce allowed one to have the power of a supreme
Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage of
heartforce, however, gave one the power of a supreme Empyrean God or
True Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Empyrean
God and True Immortal who had reached the fourth stage of heartforce
stood at the very peak of power amongst their peers. The divine
archer Eastbreak, for example…after using Daofruits of primordial
chaos, he was able to suppress an entire battlefield all by himself!
Although the Daofruits were very powerful…if it hadn’t been for
Eastbreak’s archery and coreforce, how could the other Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals have all been completely shut down?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’ve only
reached the expert level in my soul heartforce technique…even
reaching the level of perfect mastery would probably increase my
power by a mere tenfold, by a single level of so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With my heartforce
having increased from the third level to the fourth level…my power
has increased by multiple levels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself knew how
much he had improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to see
the Daofather.” Ning rose to his feet. He felt guilt towards
Daofather Crimsonbright. It had been the Daofather who had personally
handed him Shennong’s medicine in a show of tremendous faith.
Although it was Yu Wei who had turned traitor…in the end, it was
his fault!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
vast, desolate wilderness. He also stared at the enormous black
levitating citadel, the Seamless City. He quietly murmured to
himself, “This battle isn’t over yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, his
Heaven Punisher was already very powerful. With his heartforce having
increased by an entire major level…how powerful would his Heaven
Punisher become? Not even Ning himself knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because only a
few Empyrean Gods or True Immortals had ever reached the fourth level
of heartforce. Of them, Ning was the only one who had developed a
soul heartforce technique! In other words…in the entire Three
Realms, there was no Empyrean God or True Immortal whose Heaven
Punisher was stronger than Ning’s. His was the most powerful of
them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.”
Boundless hatred could be seen within Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked down from
the city walls, then towards the distant main palace of the Eight
Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Godking knew
that his decision to force Ji Ning to make such an agonizing decision
had resulted in Ning’s heartforce advancing from the third stage to
the fourth stage…it’s hard to imagine how much regret he would
feel. This was an advancement that was even more terrifying than
perfecting the soul heartforce technique! And now…he had personally
created a freak who knew the soul heartforce technique and had fourth
stage heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking’s
original goal had merely been to make Ji Ning join the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was walking
towards the main palace of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is Ji Ning going
towards the main hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He spent a few days
sitting blankly atop the city walls. I wonder what he was thinking
about? This must have been an enormous blow to him, and he also
caused us to lose this Realmwar…I hope he’s not blaming himself
so much that his thoughts are in a complete mess, causing him to go
seek out the Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…he truly is a
peerless monster, the likes of which are rarely seen. I hope he
hasn’t been ruined by his Dao-companion…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals who saw
Ning walking towards the main hall all chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Love…it was a single
word, but because of this word, countless lives had been destroyed
and countless paths had been severed. This happened far, far too
often within the Three Realms. However…those who were able to
persevere after suffering such blows, who were able to continue to
advance…they all became awe-inspiring figures of the Three Realms.
They were no longer referred to as ‘monstrous geniuses’; they
were known as the true experts of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The Xia
Emperor walked out from the main palace. He said in surprise, “Why
have you come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to see the
Daofather,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather is not
in a good mood. It’s best if you don’t go,” the Xia Emperor
said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not in a good mood?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The Xia
Emperor nodded. “Human Emperor Shennong is out of ideas, but the
Daofather is still unwilling to give up. He’s spent countless years
building his Crimsonbright Realm up, after all. Thus, the Daofather
went out to meet with other major powers, including the leaders of
the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Sangha, as well as others,
but…alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor looked
towards Ning. “Do you still wish to see the Daofather, then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s aura suddenly
transformed from that of a Celestial Immortal to that of a Pure Yang
True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure…Pure Yang?!”
The Xia Emperor’s eyes instantly turned round and huge. Overjoyed,
he said, “Ji Ning, you made a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he’d already
decided that he was going to win this Realmwar…he had remain
careful of the Seamless Gate’s intelligence network. Thus, Ning
only revealed the fact that he had the power of a Pure Yang True
Immortal, intending to force the Seamless Gate into a series of
miscalculations. As for reaching the fourth level of heartforce…for
now, he had to hide this. He would only reveal his power at a
critical moment, allowing them to win this war in one blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he wanted to
hide it from them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to hide it from
everyone! Only when he alone knew this secret would it truly be a
secret. If he told anyone else at all, the Seamless Gate would have a
chance to find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fantastic. This…this
is absolutely fantastic.” The Xia Emperor was extremely excited.
“Your breakthrough to the Pure Yang level means that your Heaven
Punisher will increase dramatically in power. If you join forces with
the Seven Planets God, you might be able to completely tie down the
Daofather golem. During the last battle, the Seamless Gate managed to
escape with some of its forces, preventing us from wiping them out.
They still suffered castastrophic losses, however. If you and the
Seven Planets God can tie down the Daofather golem…leave the
others, including the Three-Eyed Demon, to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go! Let’s
go see the Daofather.” The Xia Emperor was incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
followed the Xia Emperor into the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather’s in
a side hall.” The Xia Emperor led Ning forward in a very familiar
manner. Soon, Ning saw a quiet, secluded side hall with Daofather
Crimsonbright seated in the lotus position within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…as soon as
Ning saw the Daofather, he could sense the deathly, melancholy aura
surrounding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a sort of
melancholic aura which would naturally emerge once one felt
completely powerless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The Xia
Emperor spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather.” Ning
called out respectfully as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
opened his eyes. Upon seeing Ning, he nodded gently. “It seems
you’ve managed to bestir yourself a bit, Ji Ning. Our loss in this
Realmwar cannot be blamed upon you. You couldn’t have imagined any
of those things happening. If we lose, we lose. There’s always a
victor and a loser in any war. Later, I shall summon the other
Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and army commanders and issue an order
to retreat. You should roam the Three Realms a bit and relax. Both
your master and myself have great expectations of you. Our war with
the Seamless Gate shall continue. Although we’ve lost here, we’ll
still need you to go fight in other places in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather was a
Daofather, after all. Although he felt grief at completely losing his
territory and his foundation, his gaze was still focused on the Three
Realms as a whole. He naturally didn’t wish to see Ji Ning sink
into endless despair; in fact, he didn’t even want to blame Ji Ning
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…Ji Ning
broke through to the Pure Yang True Immortal level,” the Xia
Emperor said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
was briefly stunned…and then his eyes lit up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His melancholic aura
completely vanished. He once more became full of vigor and energy. He
stared at Ning, then said with a laugh, “I really have grown old. I
was so dispirited by this Realmwar that I’ve become as blind as a
bat. I didn’t realize you made a breakthrough, even though you are
standing right in front of me. Haha…Pure Yang True Immortal…you’ve
broke through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal…then doesn’t
that mean your Heaven Punisher shall dramatically increase in power?
If you join forces with the Seven Planets God commanded by Redsnow,
you should be able to tie down the Daofather golem, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, please
give me 9000 Celestial Immortals and 810,000 Loose Immortals so that
I may create a maximum-power Heaven Punisher,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Superb.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing how
confident Ji Ning was, Daofather Crimsonbright couldn’t help but
call out the word ‘superb’. Ji Ning had previously already
commanded 3000 Celestial Immortals; all they had to do now was merge
six more Heaven Punisher armies into his army. Six ordinary Heaven
Punishers wouldn’t make much of a difference in the grand scheme of
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give the
orders right away. Prepare for a final battle against the Seamless
Gate!” Daofather Crimsonbright’s eyes gleamed with light. His
aura filled the heavens, and his voice boomed forth.

Chapter 52 - The Confident Evergreen
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per Daofather
Crimsonbright’s orders, all the Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and
army commanders assembled at the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re going to go
fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
now has a Daofather golem. How are we supposed to beat that?” Once
Daofather Crimsonbright said that he was going to launch a true,
final battle against the Seamless Gate, everyone was completely
speechless. They weren’t afraid of death, but no one would be
willing to throw their lives away in a situation where they had no
chance of winning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
looked down at his subordinates, then turned his head to look towards
a side door. “Ji Ning, come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods, True
Immortals, and army commanders all felt puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let Ji Ning come
out? After experiencing his Dao-companion’s betrayal…I imagine
that he couldn’t have fully recovered yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
what the Daofather is planning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we supposed to
entrust everything to Ji Ning, who is at the brink of absolute
collapse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can’t be joking
with us, can he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some felt anger towards
Ning, while others felt sympathy and pity. All of them, however, felt
certain that this peerless genius must have been delivered a blow
from which he would need time to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Footsteps rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Upon seeing
Ji Ning walk out, virtually everyone was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He…he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all of the
Immortals and Fiendgods within the main hall were stupefied. They
knew exactly how heavy a blow Ji Ning had just suffered. In their
private conversations, most of them secretly opined that Ji Ning
would probably wallow in his misery as a result of this blow. None of
them had imagined that Ji Ning would actually break through to become
a Pure Yang True Immortal at such a critical point in time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To break through into
the Pure Yang level was no easy feat. To completely and thoroughly
master a Grand Dao was no easy task. Given the blow he had suffered
and the mental anguish he was in…it would have been incredibly,
incredibly difficult for him to make a breakthrough in the Dao of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The truth was right
before them. The dense Pure Yang aura surrounding Ji Ning was
unmistakeably real!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has broken
through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal. His Heaven Punisher can
now command much greater power.” Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice
boomed down from his high throne. “I will put 9000 Celestial
Immortals and 810,000 Loose Immortals under his command, allowing him
to form and command a perfect Heaven Punisher! Ji Ning’s Heaven
Punisher, when working in concert with Redsnow’s Seven Planets God,
will handle the Daofather golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
continued, “All of you are to immediately summon your soldiers and
prepare for the final battle! In this final battle, our goal is to
completely shatter the forces of the Seamless Gate and to protect our
Realm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” All of the
Immortals and Fiendgods awoke from their stupor. They were all
incomparably delighted, and their eyes glowed with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, they all
seemed to have lost their souls. They had no morale to speak of…and
even Daofather Crimsonbright himself had been surrounded by a
melancholic aura. But now, upon seeing a chance to gain victory, all
of them became filled with a desire to do battle. They were so
excited that their hearts once more began to boil with hot blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually able
to make a breakthrough to the Pure Yang level after suffering such a
blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning truly
is incredible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, quite a few
of them had felt resentment towards Ji Ning, but all of that
dissipated like smoke. All they felt towards him was amazement and
admiration! To be able to make a breakthrough and completely change
the course of the war at such a critical moment…how could they not
feel admiration?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand army began to
mobilize.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sinuous Raindragons and
towering Pangu War-Formations once more took form, along with many
Heaven Punishers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most astonishingly
powerful aura, however, came from Ji Ning’s ‘Darknorth Army’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, the
Darknorth Army had a total of 9000 Celestial Immortals and 810,000
Loose Immortals! This was the most perfect form possible for the
[Heaven Punisher Formation]. The amount of natural energy which this
sea of Immortals could summon…it was at an absolutely
incomprehensible level. However, even Xingtian himself had only
created a ‘perfect’ version of his formation just for the sake of
completeness; he himself felt that it was a waste for an Empyrean God
or True Immortal to use it, as there was simply no way for them to
use all that energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.” Ning gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 9000 Celestial
Immortals were spread out around Ning, protecting him like a hive of
hornets protecting their queen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the 810,000
Loose Immortals, they were like countless stars or grains of sand
that were spread out throughout the formation. As the incomparably
marvelous formation began to be activated, an absolutely shocking
whirlpool of energy was formed around the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
This was the very first time the Crimsonbright Realm had truly,
completely unleashed the full power of a Heaven Punisher. Once the
number of Immortals had reached the target number, the amount of
natural energy they could command was similarly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The natural energy had
become completely solidified, seeming to have transformed into
enormous pillars of water that surged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive water
pillars, many tens of thousands of meters in length, swirled around
Ning’s army before rapidly condensing around it. Slowly…the
bones, the flesh, and the skin began to take form as an unprecedently
enormous Heaven Punisher appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
aura.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel as
though…he’s roughly on the same level as True Gods or
Daofathers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the perfect Heaven
Punisher appeared, all of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the
Crimsonbright Realm were stunned. However…they also all knew that
if the commander of the formation was unable to command and control
all of that massive power, the power would completely go to waste!
Even amongst Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, there were many who
couldn’t fully control 100% of the power of the simplest types of
Heaven Punishers, much less the perfect ones!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning felt
absolutely inconceivable power coming from the perfect Heaven
Punisher he commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning began
to take control over the power of the Heaven Punisher. He applied
heartforce to his soul, then used his Pure Yang energy to go all-out
in taking control over the energy within the formation! More and more
power began to enter the Heaven Punisher through the formation. Ten
percent. Twenty percent. Thirty percent. An absolutely unbelievable
amount of energy was coming under Ning’s command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the energy that he
could control was ‘his’; anything he could not control would be
just wasted energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning reached
his limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety percent! I
can vaguely sense that I’m controlling ninety percent of the power
of this perfect Heaven Punisher.” Ning felt stunned as well…because
he could sense that just ten percent of the power of the perfect
Heaven Punisher was already vastly more powerful than the full power
of his old Heaven Punisher, which had merely been powered by three
thousand Celestial Immortals and three hundred thousand Loose
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, his
heartforce had reached the fourth stage. Otherwise…with just
third-stage heartforce, even if he used his soul heartforce technique
he would probably only be able to just barely command a tenth of the
power of this perfect Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one could tell from
the surface as to how much control Ning had over the Heaven Punisher
Formation. Not even the primordial wargod who created this great
formation, Xingtian, would dare to believe that a mere Empyrean God
or True Immortal would be able to take almost complete control over a
perfect Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice boomed out, his eyes filled with a
desire to battle. “It’s time for the final battle. Let’s
completely wipe out the Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless Immortals
and Fiendgods turned frenzied with their desire to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Head out!”
Daofather Crimsonbright pointed towards the distant Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a series of
booms could be heard as the entire grand army charged towards the
distant Seamless City, blotting out the very skies themselves as they
moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast world
of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking, seated
upon his massive throne, was stunned and enraged. “He actually
broke through? Broke through to become a Pure Yang True Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He suffered such a
mental blow, then actually made a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His soul heartforce
technique had already reached the stage of mastery. Now that he’s
become a Pure Yang True Immortal and has a perfect Heaven Punisher
under his command…I imagine that his Heaven Punisher, all by
itself, is comparable to the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater. I predicted that he would be would become a threat, but
I was always just one step too slow. One step!” The Godking felt
furious, stunned, and regretful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless City.
Daofather Ink Bamboo convened all the Empyrean Gods, True Immortals,
and army commanders to meet with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
stared down at his soldiers, his voice low. “I trust you can see
that the Crimsonbright Realm’s army is calling us out to do battle!
The reason why they have dared to emerge is because their ‘Ji
Ning’…has already broken through to become a Pure Yang True
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang True
Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s reached the
Pure Yang level? Wasn’t his Dao-companion Yu Wei one of us? He was
betrayed by his Dao-companion…but was actually able to break
through to become a True Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Seamless Gate were all stunned and baffled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Great Sage Who
Swallows the Mountains narrowed his eyes, then said, “Ji Ning is
extremely skilled in commanding Heaven Punishers. Even before this,
he was extraordinarily powerful. Now that he’s broken through, I’m
afraid that his Heaven Punisher, just by itself…will be on par with
our Three-Eyed Demon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
seventh fairy of the Nine Cloudmist Fairies frowned. “Last time,
our army collapsed and fled due to the appearance of that Seven
Planets God. Quite a few of us were slaughtered. If it wasn’t for
the Daofather golem, we would be at a decided disadvantage against
them in forces. If Ji Ning and Redsnow use their Heaven Punisher and
Seven Planets God to tie down our Daofather golem…we are probably
going to lose!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo,
seated above them, nodded. “Yes. The main issue in this battle
revolves around the question of whether or not Ji Ning and Redsnow,
when fighting together, can tie down our Daofather golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they can tie it
down…they also have another portion of Shennong’s medicine! They
outnumber us as well. Although we have the three Diremonster Gods of
Mount Dragoneater…we will probably still lose.” Daofather Ink
Bamboo looked towards Sword Immortal Evergreen. “Evergreen, we’ll
be counting on you in this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Daofather.” Sword Immortal Evergreen’s eyes flashed with fierce
light, and his voice was icy but confident. “The Daofather golem
possesses inconceivable power. Even if a true Daofather comes, it
will still probably remain undamaged. Under my command, the Daofather
golem will be exceptionally nimble and agile. The two probably won’t
be able to join forces against me; instead, I’ll break them down
one by one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Daofather
golem won’t be so easily dealt with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They definitely
won’t be able to stop it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Alliance
wouldn’t easily admit defeat either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather golem…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s Heaven
Punisher and Redsnow’s Seven Planets God…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Which would be more
powerful?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither side could be
completely certain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen, your
mission in this upcoming battle will be the most important one.”
Daofather Ink Bamboo looked towards Sword Immortal Evergreen. “No
matter what, don’t disappoint me or the Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, don’t
worry at all. I’ll definitely bring back the heads of Ji Ning and
Redsnow and offer them to you and the Godking.” A sharp, sword-like
aura could be seen within Evergreen’s eyes. He was completely
confident in himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
swept the main hall with his gaze. He growled, “Then…let us go
out and fight! This will be the final battle. Break apart the
Crimsonbright Realm’s forces and sweep them out like trash!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The
Immortals and Fiendgods all acknowledged to the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the air above the
Seamless City became filled with White-Faced Flood Dragons, Bifang
Cranes, Zhuyan Apes, and other Terrorbeasts, as well as many Empyrean
God golems and other powerful figures such as the Three-Eyed Demon.
The most dazzling of all figures…was the titanic, crimson-gold
figure that hovered in the skies. It looked just like an enormous
spider…and it emanated an aura that was no weaker than the aura of
a True God or Daofather!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two massive armies
stared against each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Following
an earth-shattering roar, the army of the Seamless Gate charged
through the skies, blotting out the sun as they swept towards the
Crimsonbright Realm’s forces.

Chapter 53 - Cleaving Heaven And Earth
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen could sense that he had become one with the
Daofather golem…and the tremendous power which the Daofather golem
contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The aura of that
perfect Heaven Punisher is quite strong as well. It lives up to its
reputation as a grand formation formed from 9000 Celestial Immortals
and 810,000 Loose Immortals. The aura alone is no weaker than the
aura of my Daofather golem.” Sword Immortal Evergreen, however,
wasn’t worried in the slightest. In fact, he was rather disdainful.
“It’s all show and no substance. What’s the use of just having
an aura of power? Although it is very strong, taking control over all
that power is harder than ascending to the heavens! Even the simplest
version of the Heaven Punisher is difficult for many Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals to command, much less the perfect version.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Punishers
could be divided into three tiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The simplest version
had 1000 Celestial Immortals and 100,000 Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The expert version had
3000 Celestial Immortals and 300,000 Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when 9000
Celestial Immortals and 810,000 Loose Immortals were used, however,
was the Heaven Punisher ‘perfect’, allowing it to reach an
inconceivable level of power. If Ning, as a Pure Yang True Immortal,
merely had third-stage heartforce and mastery over the soul
heartforce technique…he’d be able to command at most a tenth of
the Heaven Punisher’s full power. From this, one could imagine how
truly difficult it was for one to take command over the perfect
Heaven Punisher’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m different from
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a Daofather
golem, and I have complete control over all of its power. Ji Ning
isn’t much of a threat; to the contrary, it’s the Seven Planets
God, which seems to have a weaker aura than mine, which is dangerous.
It is formed from seven Empyrean Gods, and Redsnow has complete
control over all of its power as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Evergreen’s
control, the Daofather golem was extremely fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Distorted light could
be seen in the skies. The Daofather golem looked like a spider
crawling upon the vast web of heaven as it charged forward, the first
to attack the Crimsonbright Realm’s forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle wasn’t
just being watched by Daofather Crimsonbright, the Godking, and
Daofather Ink Bamboo. In truth, more than 90% of the Daofathers of
the Three Realms were watching this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Ling, in the
western region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha was seated
up high on his honored throne, radiating a boundless aura of light.
The light surrounding him was dazzling to behold, and if one looked
at it carefully, one would be able to vaguely make out the colors of
the Five Elements. Beneath him was seated Amitabha, Kshitigarbha,
Maitreya, and other major powers of the Buddhist Sangha. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha, also known
as Tathagata, was the highest-level Buddhist leader of the Three
Realms. His power was inconceivable, and the divine abilities he had
devised, such as the [Vairocana Guardian Halo] and the [Buddha-Realm
Within the Palm] were some of the most supreme divine abilities of
the Three Realms. Only Mother Nuwa was more powerful than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Buddhas seated
below him were all extraordinarily formidable as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amitabha, for example,
had created ten million clones of himself. In both the Primordial Era
and the modern day, his many clones were constantly spreading the
teachings of Buddhism. It could be said that many of the most
formidable figures of Buddhism had received some degree of tutelage
from Amitabha. There was a widespread saying; more than half of the
arhats and bodhisattvas of the Three Realms had been taught by
Amitabha and thus succeeded in their cultivation. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
bodhisattvas and arhats thus naturally felt tremendous gratitude
towards the Buddha Amitabha. Thus, Buddha Amitabha had a very special
status amongst the ranks of the Buddhist Sangha. He was often
referred to as the ‘Teacher Buddha’, or as the ‘Welcomer
Buddha’, which referred to his actions in welcoming his many
adherents to his pure land of Sukhavati, the Western Paradise. 3 The
holy light radiating from Buddha Amitabha was a light of infinite
kindness and gentleness. Anyone who saw it would feel inner peace,
and they would uncontrollably wish to kneel down and listen to his
teachings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Multiple Realmwars
have occurred within the Three Realms. All the major powers are
tiring themselves out for the sake of this great war.” The gaze of
Lord Tathagata pierced through the vast Void, allowing him to see the
battle within the Crimsonbright Realm. “For the sake of his Realm,
Crimsonbright has done everything he can. This Realmwar is a far
greater one than the ones which have come before. Welcomer, do you
think they can win?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Amitabha’s
gaze was kind and benevolent. Clasping his hands together, he said,
“The key issue in this battle revolves around the battle between
the Daofather golem, which shall battle Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher
and Redsnow’s Seven Planets God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other major
Buddhist powers were watching as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was only natural
that they cared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a minor matter
for a Celestial Emperor to be changed, but a Realmwar would have a
major impact on karmic luck! The two sides were currently engaged in
a war for karmic luck, with the Endwar only coming once both sides
were convinced that no further gains could be made. That was when all
of the major Buddhist powers would have to go all out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many of
us shall be at Mount Ling, after the great storm passes.” Lord
Tathagata stared downwards, sighing to himself. He could never forget
how much blood had been shed when the Primordial Era was brought to
an end. Even he had very nearly perished before the might of the Lord
of All Things. Fortunately, by relying on his [Golden Nirmana Body],
he was able to survive and keep the Lord of All Things tied down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That had been a
calamitous war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The majority of the
Buddhas of the Buddhist Sangha had died in battle. Fortunately,
Mother Nuwa had made a breakthrough in the end, allowing for a
reversal in the war!

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Palace, in the
eastern regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
was seated high up upon his throne. Unlike Lord Buddha, Daoist Three
Purities had a much more reserved aura. And yet, when one looked at
Daoist Three Purities…one would occasionally feel as though one was
seeing a terrifying illusion of the destruction of the entire Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath him were seated
the major powers of the Daoist Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are about to see
a result to this Realmwar,” Daoist Three Purities said softly.
“Zixiu, who do you think will win?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man with a long
beard who was dressed in loose robes said softly, “Fifty-fifty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This old man was
Daofather Carefree. He was also known as Zhuang Zhou…Zhuang Zixiu!

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, two True Gods
were born from the primordial chaos and became extremely good
friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was Yuanshi
Tianzun, the Exalted Celestial of Genesis. The second was Xiaoyao
Tianzun, the Carefree Exalted Celestial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had trained
painstakingly, with Yuanshi Tianzun having mastered the Heavenly Dao
of Yang and the Heavenly Dao of Destruction. Of the ten Heavenly
Daos, however, the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos was the most
exalted of Daos. The Heavenly Dao of Life was mated with the Heavenly
Dao of Destruction, while the Heavenly Dao of Yin was mated with the
Heavenly Dao of Yang. Last came the Five Elements of metal, wood,
water, fire, and earth. If one wanted to make a qualitative
breakthrough, one would have to gain insights into matching sets of
Heavenly Daos…which was incredibly hard. For example, if you gained
insights into the Heavenly Dao of Life, then the Heavenly Dao of Life
itself would interfere with your efforts to gain insights into the
Heavenly Dao of Destruction, preventing you from calmly training in
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or, for example, the
Five Elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one managed to
master metal, wood, water, and fire…then when one began to work on
water, one would suffer many interferences. Thus, it was incredibly
difficult to master the full set of Five Elements, the duality of
Life and Destruction, or the duality of Yin and Yang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata had
managed to master the entire Five Elements of the Heavenly Daos,
which was why he was able to become the leader of the Buddhist
Sangha!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuanshi Tianzun had
tremendous willpower and determination. During the Primordial Era, he
placed a seal on his own truesoul, one which locked away his memories
and prevented him from reawakening them unless he fully mastered the
Heavenly Dao of Yin. He then sent himself into the Six Paths of
Reincarnation and committed suicide, sending his truesoul into the
cycle of reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was reborn multiple
times. On his ninth life, he was reborn as Laozi 5! In this life, he
finally embarked on a path of nonstop breakthroughs, culminating in
him mastering the Heavenly Dao of Yin and becoming a Daofather. At
this moment, his memories were completely reawakened…and with Yin
and Yang joined together, his power instantly skyrocketed, resulting
in him standing at the very pinnacle of the Three Realms! Back then,
of course, Mother Nuwa hadn’t reached the Pangu level yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He devised a technique
which allowed him to transform in the Three Pure Ones; Shangqing the
Supreme Pure One, Yuqing the Jade Pure One, and Taiqing the Grand
Pure One. His three incarnations all had their separate strengths,
and they were each very suited to their respective Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yuqing was his
former, true body; known as Yuanshi Tianzun, it controlled the
Heavenly Dao of Yang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Shangqing was
known as Lingbao Tianzun, the Exalted Celestial of the Holy Treasure.
He controlled the Heavenly Dao of Destruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Taiqing was the
reincarnated Laozi, the master of the Heavenly Dao of Yin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Daoist Three
Purities had devised this technique to create the Three Pure Ones,
his three incarnations were capable of joining together to reach an
unfathomable level of power. He had even been able to battle the
‘king’ of the Seamless Gate for a long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Committing suicide and
sending the truesoul to be reincarnated was incredibly dangerous. For
example, if in a reincarnated life he had become a Celestial
Immortal, then suddenly was killed and had his soul shattered, his
truesoul would’ve been sent into the River of Destiny. He would’ve
truly been dead, then! What he did was a dangerous gamble…but
Yuanshi Tianzun possessed astonishing willpower and determination,
which was why he dared to act in such a way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Carefree Exalted
Celestial, however, didn’t possess that sort of determination. He
did, however, create an incarnation which he sent to be reborn and
experience new lives. In these new lives, however, he was naturally
unable to gain any insights into the corresponding Heavenly Dao.
Still, he didn’t care about this at all, because his power was
still considered one of the top five of the Daoist Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had taken on
two true teachers. One was Daoist Three Purities, while the other was
the Carefree Exalted Celestial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Primordial Imperial Clan, and other regions within the primordial
chaos, such as Shennong’s residence or the residence of the ancient
Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These ancient figures,
some of whom were legendary recluses of the Three Realms, were all
watching this battle. Perhaps they might’ve been reclusive in the
past, but now that the storm had come, there was no way for them to
avoid it. They would have to fight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Similarly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the ancient,
major powers of the Seamless Alliance, scattered throughout the Three
Realms, were watching as well. This was the time for the war for
karmic luck, which was why they permitted the Godking to be in charge
of the Seamless Gate! When the end came, however…these ancient
figures would emerge. Long ago, they had followed behind their
king…and compared to them, this ‘Godking’ was actually one of
their juniors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle hinges
on the performance of those three.” All the major powers understood
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather golem was
the fastest on its side, while the Seven Planets God and perfect
Heaven Punisher were the fastest on the Crimsonbright Realm’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them were
like the tips of the spear for their respective armies, and they
headed straight towards each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the titanic spider
flew forward, it suddenly lashed out with two of its slender,
knife-legs, sending two blurry streaks of light flying towards the
Crimsonbright Realm’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it! Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant units
immediately pooled its power to defend against the strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although three Heaven
Punishers and a Raindragon joined forces to block the strike, one of
the Heaven Punishers was completely shattered. Fortunately, the
Daofather golem had launched an attack from very far away, and so
very few Immortals within the Heaven Punisher were slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
power. Ji Ning, let me test him first,” Empyrean God Redsnow sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
brandished its spear. Snow began to fall in the area around it as
spacetime began to twist and distort. Its power increased
dramatically as it charged straight towards the Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning was to
explode forth with the full power of the perfect Heaven Punisher, his
speed wouldn’t be slower than that of the Seven Planets God at all.
However…Ning understood that once he unleashed his full power, the
controller of the Daofather golem would become cautious! Thus, the
best plan was to wait for them to actually clash. If he could catch
his foe off-guard at the point of collision, it would result in a
major advantage for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow, you dare to
take my Daofather golem head-on with that little bit of power you
have? Die!” Sword Immortal Evergreen’s voice rang out from within
the Daofather golem, echoing throughout the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that
Evergreen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Evergreen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others ground their teeth as they watched carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The Seven
Planets God flung its longspear forward with such incredible power
that even the shaft of the longspear began to twist in mid-flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather golem
immediately swept out with two of its front spider-legs, blocking the
oncoming spear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying shockwave
blasted outwards, forcing the Seven Planets God backwards. Time began
to twist and distort around it, allowing it to instantly retreat by
several hundred kilometers, thus dodging the four retaliatory
leg-strikes of the pursuing Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be so
cocky!” As the Seven Planets God retreated, Ji Ning advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re the one I
really want to kill!” Sword Immortal Evergreen’s morale soared.
He had been able to easily beat back even the Seven Planets God; was
he going to be worried about Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher? Yes, the
perfect Heaven Punisher had an incredible aura, but how much power
would Ji Ning actually control?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Heaven
Punisher ran forward on its bare feet, wielding a pair of enormous
Ananda World-Swords in its hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Ananda World-Sword
was raised high into the air in a stance reminiscent of Pangu
splitting apart Heaven and Earth to establish the universe. It
chopped straight downwards! This was a stance which Ning had created
after he thoroughly mastered the Grand Dao of the Sword…the twelfth
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. However, because he had been hiding
his status as a Pure Yang True Immortal in the past, he had never
used this technique before. Now…it was finally time for him to
unleash it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three-Foot Sword],
twelfth stance - Cleaving Heaven and Earth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With this stance, the
entire [Three-Foot Sword] was finally perfected. These twelve stances
covered the entirety of the Grand Dao of the Sword, from the basics
to full mastery of it. The reason why Ning had chosen such a mighty
name, ‘Cleaving Heaven and Earth’, was because he had been in an
excellent mood and because his heartforce had been at the dominating
‘ruler’ stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen’s Daofather golem laughed wickedly, once more
using its two front spider-legs to block with the intention of
sending Ning flying back as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longsword slammed
down upon the two spider-legs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t take it
head-on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this took time
to describe, it actually all happened as fast as lightning. Just
after the Seven Planets God retreated, Ji Ning’s swords came
chopping down. This greatly shocked Empyrean God Redsnow and the
others. He knew that Ji Ning had to have seen the astonishing power
of the Daofather golem from its clash against the Seven Planets God;
how could Ji Ning be so foolish as to fight it head-on?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go d-…what
the hell!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s morale was soaring, he suddenly sensed a surge of
inconceivable power pass into the golem from the longsword. The power
of the blow was so great…that even his Daofather golem felt
somewhat unable to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far too powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! As Ning’s
barefoot Heaven Punisher leapt forward, its angry sword-blow smote
the Daofather golem down into the ground, causing the earth beneath
it to cave in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather golem
is actually weaker?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this isn’t
possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on the
battlefield was stunned. The Seamless Gate’s forces had been very
confident in the power of the Daofather golem; Evergreen was able to
fully unleash all of its power, after all. Although the perfect
Heaven Punisher possessed an aura of tremendous might which was
comparable to that of an actual True God or Daofather…how much of
that power could Ji Ning control? How could he possibly be able to
suppress the Daofather golem?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!!!”
Sword Immortal Evergreen was utterly enraged. He used all his power
to push upwards while sending two more of his spider-legs upwards to
block Ning’s longsword. Four legs supporting it on the ground, four
legs pressing upwards to defend; he was already using as much power
as he could from the Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall KNEEL
before me!” Ning’s other longsword came slamming down as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same stance;
Cleaving Heaven and Earth! When staring at it, one could almost see
Pangu within the primordial chaos, brandishing his greataxe to chop
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather golem was
using four of its spider-legs to block, giving it only four other
spider-legs to stand on. In the face of this mountain of pressure
that slammed down upon it…the four spider-legs it was standing on
went limp as it was pressed down onto its knee-joints.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two armies had been
charging towards each other, but had yet to actually join battle.
Both instantly fell completely silent. The Crimsonbright Realm’s
forces, the Seamless Gate’s forces…they all just stared in
disbelief at this sight!

Chapter 54 - Release
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The utterly indomitable
Daofather golem…had actually been suppressed in power by a Heaven
Punisher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two swords had
struck down as if they possessed the power to cleave apart Heaven and
Earth. The Daofather golem was completely unable to endure their
power, resulting it in being knocked into a kneeling crouch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!
Just him by himself?” Sword Immortal Evergreen’s heart was filled
with both rage and panic. “How can I possibly be unable to overcome
Ji Ning? I should be able to beat him and Redsnow combined. How can I
possibly be defeated by him alone?!” Sword Immortal Evergreen had
already made many boasts before the Daofather and his fellow
Immortals…and his victory was necessary and critical for the entire
Realmwar to be won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to lose…how
could he face the Seamless Gate afterwards?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already betrayed
the Nuwa Alliance. He needed to have a firm footing within the
Seamless Alliance now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle was
incredibly important to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You imbecile! Why
are you competing with him in strength? Since he has incredible
power, hurry up and use your speed and agility!” Daofather Ink
Bamboo’s mental voice carried urgency and panic within it as well.
“Quick, quick, quick! The two armies have already begun to fight
against each other. You have to win. If you lose, our army will lose
all of its morale and collapse!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daofather. I
was merely testing his strength, just now,” Sword Immortal
Evergreen immediately responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather
spider-golem’s thin legs began to move quickly, tearing apart the
ground as it scuttled backwards like a streak of twisted light,
retreating into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Boom. Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armies of the
Crimsonbright Realm and the Seamless Gate were quite fast as well.
They had already begun to battle against each other. The soldiers of
each side started to slaughter each other, and many Immortals and
Fiendgods began to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
suffered castastrophic losses last time. Although the three
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater led their allies, they were
still at a marked disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies themselves
seemed to turn dark as chaotic whirlpools of natural energy could be
seen everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s towering
Heaven Punisher wielded two enormous Ananda World-Swords as he bound
forward on bare feet, chasing after the Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and get rid
of that Heaven Punisher and the Seven Planets God,” Daofather Ink
Bamboo sent frantically. “Kill them as fast as you can. If you let
them tie you down, we’re going to lose!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen ground his teeth, madness visible within his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s very strong;
I can’t fight against him head-on. But my Daofather golem is
incredible fast and agile; I refuse to believe you can overcome me.”
The Daofather spider-golem’s enormous body was actually so nimble
that it left behind a series of twisted streaks of light in the skies
as it charged towards Ning. Clearly, Sword Immortal Evergreen wasn’t
willing to lose by Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Four of the
slender, knife-like spider-legs of the Daofather-golem pierced
straight towards Ning’s Heaven Punisher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!” Ning’s
Heaven Punisher lashed out with its right hand, and the Ananda
World-Sword within its right hand left behind a wave of light in the
skies. It was like a waterfall of sword-light…and with a thundering
collision, the four attacking spider-legs of the Daofather golem were
completely blocked by this single sword-stroke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entangle.” Ning’s
other sword lashed out as well, transforming into a stream of
sword-light of incredible speed and density. It struck down, pierced
forward, slashed sideways…sword-light flowed past in so many
different ways that it was as though a flood of sword-light was
entangling the Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment,
snowflakes began to drift in from far away. The spear-wielding Seven
Planets God had arrived as well, and as soon as it came, its
longspear struck out like a swimming dragon against the Daofather
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Bang! Crash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consecutive assaults
from Ning’s Heaven Punisher and Redsnow’s Seven Planets God
landed upon the body of the Daofather golem. The Daofather golem was
completely undamaged, but due to the repeated assaults from the two
of them, it had been temporarily tied down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn! How is
this happening!?” Sword Immortal Evergreen was truly growing
frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow,
leave this Daofather golem to me. Hurry up and help our army destroy
the Seamless Gate’s forces as fast as possible,” Ning sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
sure you can handle it?” Empyrean God Redsnow sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sure,” Ning
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Redsnow
trusted Ning; he knew Ning very well, after all, and understood his
temperament. In addition, it was true that while the Seamless Gate’s
forces were at a disadvantage on the battlefield, the Seamless Gate
simply had far too many of those Empyrean God golems. Killing them
was far more difficult than killing the other Immortals and Fiendgods
and Terrorbeasts. The counter-attacks led by the Seamless Gate’s
Three-Eyed Demon were also quite savage. If the fight continued like
this…even if they ended up winning, they’d suffer heavy losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The snow
continued to fall as spacetime began to twist and distort. The Seven
Planets God, longspear in hand, moved at an absolutely incredible
speed as he charged straight towards the army of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! The Seven
Planets God is attacking!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good! Stop him,
quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re in trouble
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
army instantly began to panic. They knew exactly how terrifying this
Seven Planets God was. During the last battle, the three Diremonster
Gods of Mount Dragoneater and multiple other Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals had to join forces against it, but were still unable to
defeat it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
was watching from atop the distant city walls of the levitating
Seamless City. His face instantly changed, and he roared mentally,
“Evergreen, quick! The Seven Planets God has already left your
region and is charging towards the main army! My army is completely
unable to defend against it. The more time passes, the more of them
will be slaughtered. The only person you are faced with is Ji Ning!
Hurry up and get rid of him, then go support the army!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s by himself. I
HAVE to be able to kill him.” Sword Immortal Evergreen had gone
completely berserk…but in truth, in his heart, he didn’t feel any
confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
power which Ji Ning had revealed was far greater than what he had
expected. However, he also knew that for the sake of this entire
battle, he had to kill Ji Ning no matter what, and quickly! The more
this dragged on, the greater a massacre the Seven Planets God would
wreak upon the Seamless Gate’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per the original
estimations of Sword Immortal Evergreen, Daofather Ink Bamboo, the
Godking, and the other major powers of the Seamless Gate, Ji Ning’s
Heaven Punisher and Redsnow’s Seven Planets God would perhaps be
able to just barely hold their own against the Daofather golem. If
the Seven Planets God was to attack the army, then Ji Ning would be
quickly killed, allowing the Daofather golem to then fight the Seven
Planets God by itself and kill it. Thus…per their original
expectations, for the Seven Planets God to abandon Ji Ning and
instead attack the main army would be absolutely wonderful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But though man
proposes, Heaven disposes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, on the field of
battle, the Seven Planets God had chosen to attack the great army…and
Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher truly was facing the Daofather golem by
itself. But…could the Daofather golem kill it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, DIE!”
The titanic Daofather spider-golem had transformed into a series of
twisted light-streaks, assaulting Ning’s Heaven Punisher time and
time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brandishing the two
enormous Ananda World-Swords in his hands, Ning’s aura seemed
equivalent to Xingtian’s own aura! Evergreen’s Daofather golem
was at a marked disadvantage, and Ning’s sword-arts were extremely
well-suited for defense. No matter how the Daofather golem assaulted
Ning, it wasn’t able to wound Ning in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!”
Daofather Crimsonbright, watching from the walls of the Eight Dragons
Cloudcity, was instantly delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the walls of the
Seamless City, however, Daofather Ink Bamboo’s face was ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once he saw the
Daofather golem go all-out but still be unable to kill Ji Ning, he
knew that they had lost!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, if the Seven
Planets God and Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher were able to block the
Daofather golem, then the Seamless Gate would lose…much less Ji
Ning being able to do it by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you can’t
kill him, forget about him.” A deep, low voice boomed out within
Sword Immortal Evergreen’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking.”
Sword Immortal Evergreen was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood that upon
seeing that this war was about to be lost, the Godking was no longer
able to remain calm. The Godking was now personally giving orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and charge
towards the Crimsonbright Realm’s army. If you attack them, you’ll
at least be able to buy some time for our army to retreat.” The
Godking was suppressing his anger as he gave the orders. “Attack
with all your power. Do everything you can. The more Immortals and
Fiendgods you can tie down, the more of our forces will be able to
retreat safely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous Daofather
spider-golem turned and immediately began to leave, intending to
charge towards the Crimsonbright Realm’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to leave?”
Ning ran forward, his tremendous power granting him incredible speed!
Perhaps his Heaven Punisher was a bit weaker in terms of agility, but
in terms of running speed alone he wasn’t slower than the Daofather
golem at all; he was in control of 90% of the power of this perfect
Heaven Punisher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of strength,
he was noticeably and significantly stronger than the Daofather
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of speed, he
wasn’t any weaker than the Daofather golem either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning took eight
giant steps forward, then launched a blow of sword-light towards the
retreating Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Sword
Immortal Evergreen was absolutely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hurriedly shot
forward like a streak of twisted light, seeking to dodge…but the
massive Heaven Punisher, clad only in a fur loincloth, took yet
another great leap forward. It caught up with just a step and once
more launched a sword-light assault of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah, the
Daofather golem has been completely tied down. It can’t even slow
down our army’s assaults. Kill them, kill them all!” Daofather
Crimsonbright was absolutely beside himself with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all!”
The Xia Emperor and the others finally let loose all of the repressed
anger they had felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragons, the
massive Pangu War-Formations, and the countless Heaven Punishers…they
began a wild slaughter of the enemy forces. Some of the Empyrean God
golems were suppressed so thoroughly that they were even sucked away
into magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Planets God
in particular…its longspear was an absolute slaughterer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fresh blood flew
everywhere!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Immortals and
Fiends perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massacre, led by the
Seven Planets God. It was an absolute massacre. The Seamless Gate’s
forces began to show signs of collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody could stop the
Seven Planets God. The only one that could, the Daofather golem…had
been tied down by the inconceivably powerful perfect Heaven Punisher
of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened? How?!” Sword Immortal Evergreen, the commander of the
Daofather golem, was now completely dazed and stunned. He was
supposed to become the most dazzling figure to take part in this
final battle…but instead, this had turned into an unexpected
nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. A nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This terrifying Heaven
Punisher in front of him…it was merely a Heaven Punisher, merely a
formation composed of some Celestial Immortals and Loose Immortals.
How could it possibly be able to tie down his incomparably powerful
Daofather golem, which had been created from incredibly precious
materials?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be so
powerful? The Three Realms holds several formations like the ‘Heaven
Punisher Formation’ or the ‘White-Faced Flood Dragon
Formation’…why is it that the one Ji Ning is commanding is so
powerful? It should’ve been…it should’ve been my chance to
dominate the battlefield…my chance to massacre them…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen was truly panicking now. He couldn’t even imagine how he
was supposed to face the other members of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
remained completely focused on shutting down the Daofather golem,
making it so that it was able to advance only at a very slow speed.
There was no way he would be able to make it to the Crimsonbright
Realm’s forces. The Crimsonbright Realm’s forces were thus able
to utterly massacre their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, stay your
hand! Stay your hand!” The Godking’s voice rang out in Ning’s
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking?” Ning
replied calmly, “This is war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning launched yet
another sword-blow, once more forcing the Daofather spider-golem to
its knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay your hand
immediately. Otherwise…don’t blame me if I kill your
Dao-companion, Yu Wei! I’ll let her truly perish!” The Godking
went straight to threatening Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes remained
as cold as ice. “If you want to kill her, then kill her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking was
instantly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s suffering
endless torment within your Infinity Hells. If you kill her…it’ll
be a form of release for her.” Ning’s reply was very calm, but it
filled the Godking’s heart with utter ice.

Chapter 55 - Curtain Call
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us withdraw!”
The Godking sent mentally to Daofather Ink Bamboo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A straight
withdrawal? Without the Daofather golem protecting them, their losses
will be castastrophic. The majority will probably die. Weren’t you
going to use Yu Wei to threaten Ji Ning? Was it useless? If he just
stays his hand slightly, the Daofather golem will be able to escape
and help guard our retreat,” Daofather Ink Bamboo sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were to begin a
haphazard, unguarded retreat, there would be no one to protect them
from the pursuing forces of the Crimsonbright Realm. It would be an
absolute massacre! And this time, it would be even worse than last
time. Last time, both forces were roughly equal in power, but the
Seamless Gate still had suffered heavy losses. This time…the
difference in power was significant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing I
can do,” the Godking sent mentally. “Withdraw. The sooner we
withdraw, the more of our forces will survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WITHDRAW!”
Daofather Ink Bamboo’s instantly rang out in the minds of every
single commander of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw right
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This had already been
an unbearably miserable battle for them. In fact, parts of the
Seamless Gate’s army were already showing signs of collapse prior
to this. Now…like floodwaters bursting through a dam, they began to
collapse and flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finished.”
The three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater transformed into
streaks of light, moving lightning-fast as they fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the three of them
at least, fleeing and staying alive was effortless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather golem
isn’t even guarding our retreat.” The three of them were the
fastest, and so they soon arrived within the Seamless City. They then
turned to stare and sigh at the massacre occurring behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a slaughter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
will survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Diremonster
Gods could only stand there and watch from the walls of the Seamless
City. They didn’t dare to re-enter the fray again at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were able to
escape due to how fast they were, but if they had been encircled and
surrounded by layers of soldiers, they would end up dying as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s Heaven
Punisher is a bit excessively powerful.” The three stared towards
the distance. Ji Ning’s Heaven Punisher wasn’t weaker than Sword
Immortal Evergreen’s Daofather golem at all; it was able to
completely tie the golem down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With Ji Ning tying
down the Daofather golem, the Seven Planets God is now invincible on
the battlefield.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A massacre. A simple
massacre.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them shook
their heads. Even figures as hard-hearted as them felt an ache in
their hearts as they watched. It was a miserable scene!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Save me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rescue me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrified army of
the Seamless Gate fled frantically…but how many would actually
escape? Some were killed as soon as they turned to flee. Some were
surrounded and slaughtered shortly after running! As for the Empyrean
God golems…given how terrible the Seamless Gate’s position was,
some powerful figures joined forces to completely suppress them and
seal them away into treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee, flee, flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
forces were completely focused on fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They kept on telling
us how powerful that Daofather golem was, but a single Heaven
Punisher was able to suppress it. They’ve doomed us all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Sword Immortal
Evergreen is a useless piece of garbage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen doomed us
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slaughtered
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were filled with towering amounts of
resentment. In the face of such an overwhelming disparity of power,
even they were being slaughtered, with only a few managing to escape.
Most were surrounded and killed! The Crimsonbright Realm’s army was
actively focusing on them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Realm.
Mount Ling, in the western regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha sat upon
his throne, gazing through the Void and watching the battle within
the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory.” Lord
Buddha revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning truly
is formidable…and Subhuti truly is incredible in teaching
disciples.” Amitabha nodded as well. “The rate at which this Ji
Ning is improving isn’t the slightest bit slower than the rate at
which that monkey improved at.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That monkey is
different from him. The monkey was born from the five-colored rainbow
stone which Mother Nuwa used to repair the heavens. It absorbed and
distilled the essence of Heaven and Earth, and so after taking on
Subhuti as his master, he quickly became an Empyrean God. It is hard,
however, for someone’s natural disposition to be changed. We
suppressed him and tempered him for many years before he slowly
gained enlightenment. After going into seclusion for a long period of
time, he finally managed to truly evolve and reach the True God
level.” Lord Buddha nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial Era had
given birth to some awe-inspiringly famous monsters, such as Erlang
Shen, also known as Yang Jie, or Sun Wukong of Flower-Fruit Mountain.
Although they were born in the early Primordial Era rather than when
the universe was first established, they still possessed astonishing
levels of talent. After experiencing the destruction of the
Primordial Era, quite a few had reached the True God or Daofather
level. But of course, the vast majority of those monstrous talents
hadn’t been able to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
major powers within the Three Realms, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Realm.
The Dao Palace, in the eastern regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning…from
the looks of it, his heartforce has reached the fourth stage.”
Daoist Three Purities nodded in approval.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. If his
heartforce hadn’t reached the fourth stage, there’s no way his
Heaven Punisher could be this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly is
formidable.. His heartforce has reached the fourth stage, and he’s
also learned a soul heartforce technique. Amongst Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, Ji Ning truly is number one when it comes to
commanding formations like the Heaven Punisher Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers seated
below Daoist Three Purities all nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, they
might’ve believed that Ji Ning had only reached the third stage of
heartforce, but upon watching this battle…well, none of the major
powers were fools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how
formidable a third-stage heartforce cultivator was, he wouldn’t be
this formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage,
however…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With it, Ji Ning could
already be considered one of the most supreme Pure Yang True
Immortals, even if he didn’t have many other Immortals supporting
him in formation; he was comparable to the other supreme divine
archers in strength. With the other Immortals supporting him, and
with his soul heartforce technique…he definitely had the power of a
Daofather or a True God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos.
Outside a thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong and Patriarch
Subhuti were also watching the battle for the Grand Xia through the
Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti, you’ve
produced an excellent disciple. Our side has gained yet another
formidable general.” Shennong laughed while praising Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A teacher can show
the way, but cultivation relies on one’s self! It can only be said
that I helped to guide him to his current accomplishments. But for
him to reach the fourth stage of heartforce in such a short period of
time…I truly did not expect this. I always thought that his talent
in sword-arts was superior to his talent in heartforce,” Subhuti
said. “That’s why I was actually hoping that he would spend more
of his time and efforts on the sword. After all, when swordforce is
trained to a sufficiently high level, it is no weaker than
heartforce!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All that can be said
is that this disciple of yours has tremendous potential in both
swordforce and heartforce,” Shennong said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the many major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance were all celebrating their side having
gained yet another powerful general, the Seamless Alliance’s major
powers were filled with frustration and resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had lost this
Realmwar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the Nuwa
Alliance had gained a valiant general in the form of Ji Ning. Ji
Ning, all by himself, was probably an even greater threat than the
three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater. Most likely, only the
truly supreme Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate,
the ones who were protecting the Seamless Gate’s most important
worlds within the Three Realms, would be a match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals who were absolutely superior to Ji Ning? There were none!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
had been some in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
Empyrean God in history, Houyi…one-on-one, at the Empyrean God
level, he had slain a Daofather! The current Ji Ning, even while
leading a million Immortals, would find it difficult to survive a
battle against an actual True God or Daofather. Thus, he was still
far from having reached the level of the legendary Houyi. However, in
the current Three Realms, no monster like Houyi existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually lost.
Even with a Daofather golem, they actually lost.” The Allfiend
world. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven was watching the battle for the
Grand Xia be displayed within a mirror in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daofather
golem…wasn’t able to defeat Ji Ning? He’s only trained for a
hundred years or so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was enraged. “Imbecile. Idiot. Garbage!” He gritted
his teeth. “That Sword Immortal Evergreen…he’s a useless piece
of garbage! Although he’s skilled in sword-arts, he’s only
reached the second stage of swordforce. If he had reached the fourth
stage of swordforce, how could he fail to kill Ji Ning? Ji Ning’s
only trained for a few years, but he’s actually reached the fourth
stage of heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What can I do?” Blackheaven was filled with frustration as he
suddenly realized…killing Ji Ning would be far more difficult than
he had anticipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, I
can’t let Sword Immortal Evergreen take control over my Daofather
golem again. He’s just a useless piece of garbage.” The enraged
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven took out all his frustrations upon
Sword Immortal Evergreen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather golem
continued to focus on fleeing. Although Ning continuously moved to
stop it, resulting in it moving a bit slower, in the end it was still
able to escape into the Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Daofather golem
was truly unbreakable, after all; there was no way for Ning to damage
it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth-shaking cries of
victory echoed throughout the entire battlefield. Countless Immortals
and Fiendgods were roaring together, and an endless flood of Immortal
blood had bathed the land, staining it an indelible red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering figures of
the Ning’s Heaven Punisher stood alongside the Seven Planets God.
Together, they stared towards the distant, dark Seamless City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over,” the
Seven Planets God sent mentally. “The Seamless Gate’s losses were
catastrophic; less than twenty percent managed to escape! This
Realmwar has truly ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning’s
Heaven Punisher nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…given your
current breakthrough in power, you should be able to attempt the
Empyrean Tribulation, I imagine?” The Seven Planets God sent
towards Ning.

Chapter 56 - Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Once the
Realmwar ends, I shall prepare for my Empyrean Tribulation,” Ji
Ning sent back. His original plan had been to wait until his soul
heartforce technique had been perfected before attempting the
tribulation, as that would give him a better chance. However, things
never happen quite according to plan. His heartforce had advanced
from the third level to the fourth level; this was a qualitative
change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stronger his
heartforce, the greater his chances were of overcoming the demonheart
tribulation of the Empyrean Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By this point…there
was no point in delaying any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my guess is
correct, you haven’t merely become a Pure Yang True Immortal; you
made a breakthrough in heartforce as well,” the Seven Planets God
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
admitted to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he unleashed his
full power and tied down a Daofather golem with just his Heaven
Punisher, he knew that any of the truly experienced experts of the
Three Realms would most likely be able to guess at what had happened.
For the sake of achieving victory in the Realmwar, and for the sake
of wiping out as much of the Seamless Gate’s forces as he could,
Ning didn’t mind revealing his true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing that
mattered was making sure that the outcome of his reveal was worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an outcome
that was completely worth it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many of the
Seamless Gate have died.” The Seven Planets God stood next to him,
staring at the rivers of Immortal and Fiendgod blood that stained the
vast wilderness. Countless corpses and magic treasures littered the
ground. He couldn’t help but let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not enough,” Ning
replied calmly. He watched as the armies of the Crimsonbright Realm
tidied up the battlefield, collecting the many spoils of war. When
their foes had fled, the Crimsonbright Realm’s forces had naturally
been completely focused on pursuing them, hoping to make their
victory even more overwhelming. They hadn’t had a chance to pick up
the magic treasures that had been left behind by the slaughtered
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw!” After a
long period of time, Daofather Crimsonbright’s voice rang out,
echoing throughout the battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Filled with laughter
and joy, the forces of the Crimsonbright Realm rejoiced as the entire
army escorted Ning’s Heaven Punisher and the Seven Planets God back
to the Eight Dragons Cloudcity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the Crimsonbright
Realm’s forces were jubilant, the Seamless City was filled with a
deathly silence. The aura here was both heavy and incredibly
oppressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Too many of them had
died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really was…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of the
Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater were perfectly fine, but four
of the six Diremonster Gods of Mount Tonglian had been slain. As for
the Nine Cloudmist Fairies, only the youngest Ninth Fairy had
survived; the other eight had all died. Even True Immortal Whitepole,
Empyrean God Threesuns, Empyrean God Beastleave, the Cavemaster of
the Myriad Demons Cave, and the Hallmaster of Bloodcloud Hall had
perished on the battlefield. Only Gatemaster Azurefox, who was
skilled in escape techniques, had been lucky enough to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Including Sword
Immortal Evergreen, the total number of surviving Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals on their side…was merely eleven!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disastrous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disastrous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The few lucky survivors
felt only two emotions; joy for having survived, and grief for their
losses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Seamless City. The surviving Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were
all gathered here. All of them were silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
stared downwards towards them. His gaze lingered on Sword Immortal
Evergreen for a moment, a cold light flashing through his eyes,
before he said in a calm voice, “We have lost this Realmwar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood of the room
became even heavier than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…there are
always victories and defeats in war. There have been multiple
previous Realmwars. We’ve won some of them, and we’ve also
completely shattered their forces and massacred them.” Daofather
Ink Bamboo continued calmly, “This was merely one war in one of the
many areas of the Three Realms. Since you all survived, you all have
your own special abilities. In the future, our Seamless Gate shall
continue to battle against the Nuwa Alliance. We’ll need you to
continue to go to war for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” Sword
Immortal Evergreen was the first to assent to this, and he did so
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals assented as well…and as they did, they couldn’t
help but glance sideways in a disdainful manner towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evergreen.”
Daofather Ink Bamboo looked towards Sword Immortal Evergreen. He said
coldly, “This time…you have truly disappointed me. Forget about
‘defeating both Ji Ning and Redsnow’; Ji Ning by himself was
enough to stun you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sweat appeared on Sword
Immortal Evergreen’s forehead. He understood that their losses in
this Realmwar had been utterly catastrophic. He naturally had to
shoulder blame for it. He immediately fell to his knees, then said
respectfully, “Evergreen disappointed you, Daofather. Ji Ning’s
power truly was far beyond my expectations, which is why I ended up
in such dire straits. Don’t worry, Daofather; Evergreen shall
definitely work hard to gain further insights and grow in strength,
so as to be able to better unleash the power of the Daofather golem.
Next time, I shall definitely slay Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.”
Daofather Ink Bamboo shook his head. “The major powers have already
issued an order. You are no longer required to control the Daofather
golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen’s face instantly turned white. His control over the
Daofather golem gave him a status which was slightly higher than that
of even the three Diremonster Gods of Mount Dragoneater. Without it,
he was much weaker than them. In addition, if he had the Daofather
golem with him throughout this great storm, his chances of survival
would be thousands of times greater. After all, unless a Daofather
personally intervened, it was almost impossible to kill him when he
was hiding within the Daofather golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Sword Immortal
Evergreen cared tremendously about this Daofather golem. Ever since
he had been assigned it, he had made up his mind to keep perpetual
control over it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen was unwilling to just give up. He said frantically,
“Daofather, I simply didn’t have enough time. If you give me some
more time, I’ll definitely be able to unleash more power from the-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough!” Daofather
Ink Bamboo snapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen shut his eyes. He respectfully kowtowed, pressing his
forehead down to the ground and saying nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quietly focus on
your training and your meditations. The Godking and I both view you
with great favor. If you can become a Daofather, you shall command
far more power than you would with the Daofather golem,” Daofather
Ink Bamboo said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Sword
Immortal Evergreen said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Ink Bamboo
nodded, then turned to look towards the three Diremonster Gods of
Mount Dragoneater. In a noticeably more pleasant manner, he said,
“Skyswallower, the three of you should make the arrangements for
this Seamless City to leave the Grand Xia and return to the Fifth
World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
three Diremonster Gods said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen, seeing this, couldn’t help but secretly feel regret and
hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the midst of a great
tribulation like this, the more powerful one was, the higher one’s
status would be. Even the Daofathers were not immune to this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all due to
that damnable Ji Ning. If it hadn’t been for him, I would’ve
slaughtered that Seven Planets God, then led the army of the Seamless
Gate in eradicating the army of the Crimsonbright Realm.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen’s heart was filled with endless hatred. “Just
wait. I, Evergreen, will definitely train to become even more
powerful, until the day comes when I kill you. And you three of Mount
Dragoneater…I’ll make you all kneel down to lick at my feet.
Daofather Ink Bamboo? Hmph…you are nothing more than an extremely
ordinary Daofather. Once I become a Daofather, even you shall have to
bow your head before me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evergreen had extremely
great ambitions. He was completely different from Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and many others
had become loyal followers of the Godking long ago, then had been
seeded across the various major worlds of the Three Realms in an
unorganized manner. They were allowed to develop without
interference, and so the Nuwa Alliance had naturally found it very
hard to identify them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evergreen, however, had
long ago become the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright. He truly did
belong to the Nuwa Alliance. However, despite his painstaking efforts
at training, he found it difficult to advance any further. Daofather
Crimsonbright’s abilities as a teacher were comparatively limited,
but Evergreen truly desired to grow more powerful…and this desire
caused him to become seduced by the seamless Gate. The Godking was
the sole disciple of the most powerful member of the Seamless Gate,
their ‘king’. The ‘king’, even after having become merged
into the Heavenly Daos, had continued to teach the Godking;
naturally, his tutelage was extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had used
the exact same method to teach his own disciples as well, and so he
was quite formidable in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Evergreen had been
seduced by him. The Godking had transmitted some formidable
techniques to him in the dreamworld, and had even personally
expounded on the Dao to him. But of course, Evergreen had to pay a
price as well. The price was…to leave the Nuwa Alliance and join
the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa Alliance? Who
gives a damn about alliances? My personal power is what really
matters!” Evergreen hadn’t even hesitated before immediately
joining the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His focus on the Dao
truly was quite frenzied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daofather
Crimsonbright had noticed how single-minded he was in pursuing the
Dao. Daofather Crimsonbright had even believed that Evergreen was his
subordinate with the highest chance of becoming a Daofather! But what
Crimsonbright didn’t understand…was that Evergreen’s ambitions
were simply too wild and untamed. He had an almost fanatical,
demon-like obsession towards advancing in the Dao, and it was this
obsession which led to him joining the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as Evergreen was
concerned, neither the Nuwa Alliance nor the Seamless Gate mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself was the only
person that mattered. His heart was filled with an extremely strong
desire…that one day, he would become like Mother Nuwa, the most
powerful figure of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By then…the Nuwa
Alliance and the Seamless Gate will be like nothing more than dogshit
before me. I, and I alone, shall reign supreme.” However, Sword
Immortal Evergreen kept his great ambitions hidden within his heart
because they were simply too wild. Still…he continue to pursue
them, never questioning or abandoning them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous rift
appeared within the skies, and the now-miniaturized Seamless City
flew straight into the giant rift, disappearing from the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was alone atop the
walls of the Eight Dragons Cloudcity. Turning his head, he looked
towards the lively Crimsonbright camps. Because of their great
victory, the tens of millions of Immortals and Fiendgods within the
city were all celebrating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A figure
walked towards him from afar. It was the black-robed Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty,”
Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can just call me
Xiamang,” the Xia Emperor said with a smile. “In terms of status
and influence, you aren’t much lower than me. I might be
thick-skinned enough to accept you addressing me as ‘Imperial
Majesty’, but the other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals will
undoubtedly curse me as being shameless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone is very
happy. The war is over. They’ve survived…and they’ve killed
countless Immortals and Fiendgods of the Seamless Gate. You should go
celebrate with them,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
gently shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor didn’t
try to persuade him. He could sense that ever since Yu Wei’s
betrayal, Ji Ning’s temperament and personality had changed. The
Xia Emperor understood that her betrayal truly had been a huge blow
to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. With the
Realmwar over, the soldiers shall begin to return to their respective
major worlds. The Immortals of our Grand Xia shall return with me to
the imperial capital,” the Xia Emperor said. “All of our
Immortals and Fiendgods shall remain in the imperial capital. That
way, they can easily join together to fight against the Seamless Gate
as needed. I imagine that after Azurefox’s Seamless Gate suffered
such heavy losses, they probably won’t be able to infiltrate us
that easily again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about you? Come
to the imperial capital with us,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course he wanted Ji
Ning to be in the imperial capital. The Seven Planets God moved in
lockstep with Ji Ning, which meant that Ji Ning represented a combat
force consisting of a perfect Heaven Punisher and the Seven Planets
God. This was equivalent to nearly half the total combat power of the
entire Crimsonbright Realm!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, I need to
undergo my Empyrean Tribulation.” Ning shook his head. “Other
places are not going to be safe. The Seamless Gate will undoubtedly
attempt to disrupt my tribulation, no matter where I go. The only
place for me is my master’s place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undergo the Empyrean
Tribulation?” The Xia Emperor laughed and said, “Haha, yes, it is
indeed time for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was in
quite the celebratory mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt quite fortunate
that he had chosen to treat Ji Ning so kindly all this time,
especially in the dispute between him and the Youngflame clan. He had
stood by Ji Ning’s side the entire time, and had even personally
intervened to rescue Ji Ning. These were all debts of gratitude that
Ji Ning owed him! They were in the midst of a deadly storm. If he was
to ask Ji Ning to help at a critical moment, how could Ji Ning
possibly just watch with hands folded behind his back?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, in this
war, you, Redsnow, and the rest of the seven have rendered tremendous
military merits, and we killed countless members of the Seamless Gate
at the end when they fled.” Daofather Crimsonbright was giving a
personal audience to Ji Ning, Redsnow, and the rest of the seven
Empyrean Gods. He urged them, “We’ve acquired so many treasures,
and you deserve them. Why don’t you want them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
don’t need them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly didn’t need
them. He had already acquired enough from this war…and after he
became the true master of the Starseizing Manor, he really wouldn’t
care about such a petty amount of treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…I know that
you are going to undergo your Empyrean Tribulation soon.” Daofather
Crimsonbright said with a laugh, “After you become an Empyrean God,
you’ll be able to train the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] to the Ninth
Cycle. I imagine you’ll need quite a few Daofather-level Immortal
pills! Forget about the treasures, then; I guarantee that I’ll
cover all of the pills you’ll need to train to the Ninth Cycle of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. However, I’ll need a bit of time to
prepare it all. After you complete your Empyrean Tribulation, I’ll
send them over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a tremendous
gift. Although they had gained many treasures from this war, the
value of all of them combined probably still wouldn’t be enough for
him to train to the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just accept it,
disciple. You’ve helped out Crimsonbright quite a bit this time.
You can accept it with a calm mind.” An old man with a white beard
suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Upon
seeing him, Ning immediately called out to him respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even your master
agrees. Just accept this small gift of mine.” Daofather
Crimsonbright did indeed feel grateful towards Ji Ning. He had also
learned from Subhuti that Ji Ning was the successor to Daoist
Threelives’ legacy, and that the seven Empyrean Gods would follow
Ji Ning. If it hadn’t been for Ji Ning and the seven of them, he
would’ve lost this war long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he lost the war…his
losses would be catastrophic and agonizing. Compared to that?
Although some Great Firmament Immortal pills were precious and rare,
as a True God who had been born from the primordial chaos itself, he
was still capable of giving them to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning no
longer refused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve finished
your arrangements, I imagine.” Subhuti looked towards Ning. “If
you have, then come back with me to Mount Innerheart and prepare for
the Empyrean Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve made all my
arrangements. I can leave at any moment,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already bid
farewell to his master, Immortal Diancai, and had also bid farewell
to his dear friends such as Unity and Allbeasts. Immortal Diancai,
Unity, Allbeasts, Whacko…they cared deeply about Ji Ning and didn’t
want him to leave, but they understood that the safest place for his
tribulation would be Mount Innerheart. That was a place which even
other Daofathers would find difficult to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t have the
authority to invite Unity and the others to Mount Innerheart. His
only choice was to bid them farewell. Immortal Diancai and the others
all followed the Xia Emperor back to the imperial capital, where they
would be stationed! It wouldn’t be too hard to meet with them in
the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
completed your preparations, let us go. Crimsonbright, hurry up and
prepare those Great Firmament Immortal pills. Once you’ve collected
them, just let me know and I’ll come pick them up.” As Subhuti
spoke, he waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dark gray spatial
whirlpool suddenly appeared within the palace. Subhuti led Ji Ning
and the seven Empyrean Gods straight into the spatial whirlpool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he is about
to undergo the Empyrean Tribulation right away. I need to start
gathering the pills right away as well.” Daofather Crimsonbright
hurriedly began to stroke his beard as he pondered this issue. Since
he’d already boasted that he would cover all the pills, he had to
be able to back it up. “I need to pay a visit to Daoist Three
Purities. He has the most Immortal pills. I’ll go trade some
treasures for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
continued to stroke his beard. He was in an utterly delightful mood.
This Realmwar…he had won it!
