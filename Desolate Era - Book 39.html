<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fate
had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: A Daolord Who Failed the Daomerge</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace. The Darknorth Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Solesky, Su Youji, Hegemon Azurefiend, and the Flamewing God were all
staring at the sealed gates to Ji Ning’s estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the gates to the estate swung open, followed by a white-robed youth
with a black sheath on his back emerging from within.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everything
seemed so ordinary, as though nothing at all had happened… but
Solesky, Azurefiend, and the others all sighed silently. All powerful
experts were able to sense the tiny ripples generated by a decaying
truesoul. Even though the ripples were incredibly minute, they were
constant and continuous. Even though Ning’s truesoul was
unfathomably more powerful than an ordinary mortal’s, given enough
time it would still be extinguished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Flamewing raised its giant head to stare at Ning rather desperately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Solesky and Azurefiend wanted to say something, but both hesitated.
Su Youji’s eyes were completely red, and she was using her Immortal
energy to evaporate her tears as soon as they appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look
at all of you.” Ning laughed. “Everyone who has chosen the path
of cultivation knows how difficult a path this is. The Daomerge for
an Omega Dao is the most difficult of all! I’ve failed my Daomerge,
but I was mentally prepared for that long ago. It is no big deal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
Azurefiend’s eyes lit up and he called out, “Darknorth, you have
only trained for a fairly brief period of time, but I must confess
that my Dao-heart is inferior to yours. If I had failed my Daomerge,
I wouldn’t have been able to endure it. Given my temperament, I
probably would’ve gone crazy. Even if I managed to eventually calm
down, it would’ve only happened after I vented for an extremely
long period of time. I can’t promise anything else, but I’ll
definitely continue to serve you. So long as you are alive, I will
follow you and be by your side. I’ll also carry out to the absolute
best of my ability any tasks you wish me to do in the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you.” Ning smiled. Some people who were forced to become retainers
would feel resentment, but Ning and Azurefiend had known each other
for so long that Azurefiend knew what type of person Ning was. Ning
was an open, straightforward man who was benevolent to his friends
and terrible to his foes. Azurefiend enjoyed his relationship with
Ning, and he couldn’t help but feel heartache upon seeing Ning fail
the Daomerge. He couldn’t help but sigh at how such a peerless
Daolord was about to vanish from this universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
your students and fellow disciples are all waiting outside. Shall
you…?” Solesky spoke out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry about them. This can be considered a lesson to them as to how
cruel and brutal the Daomerge is,” Ning said with a laugh. “Come,
come! All of you, sit and drink with me. We’ll have guests arriving
soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Guests?”
Azurefiend and Solesky were briefly startled, but then they
immediately understood. The Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace had
been biding their time. Now that Ning had failed the Daomerge, they
would probably make their move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
drink over here while awaiting our guests.” Ning turned to stare
towards the outside, where a number of figures were flying over to
Vastheaven Palace. He smiled. “Brother Brightshore, since you’ve
arrived, share some wine with us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The protective barriers around Vastheaven Palace split apart,
allowing Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily,
Daoist Bluestone, Emperor Goldisle, Emperor Blackcloud, and some
other Hegemons and Emperors who were on good terms with Ning to fly
inside. Everyone knew each other and could be considered friends. Now
that Ning had failed the Daomerge, all of them felt great regret and
wished to meet with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
they saw how the white-robed youth greeted them all with a smile, the
Hegemons and Emperors couldn’t help but secretly sigh once more.
How many of them would be able to so quickly regain their calm after
failing the Daomerge and suffering the most grievous blow a
cultivator could possibly suffer? No wonder Daolord Darknorth had
reached such impressive heights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
pity. Such a pity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
path was that of the Omega Dao. If he had chosen a simpler path, such
as fusing multiple Supreme Daos, he probably would’ve already
become a Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
not chit-chat too much today. Drink up!” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore and the others all understood. An expert like Ning didn’t
need the pity of others. “Alright, let’s just eat and drink!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
don’t blame me if I end up cleaning your entire stock of wine!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Drink
as much as you like. Our guests will probably interrupt us soon and
prevent us from drinking,” Ning teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Guests?”
Hegemon Brightshore and the others all quivered. They knew that Ning
was referring to Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace. They couldn’t
help but sigh. The only ones present who could truly maintain their
uncaring calm were Flamewing and Ning himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons, Emperors, Su Youji, Pillsaint, and Flamewing all casually
sat down alongside each other. Some sat down on the grass, some sat
down on the stone bridge, some sat down within the pavilion. Everyone
had a wine-laden table before them, and the estate was filled with
the sound of jesting and laughing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a short while later, a rumbling sound could be heard. Ning raised his
head fractionally, glancing off into the distance. His gaze pierced
through the void and allowed him to see a streak of azure light that
had just reached the Vastheaven Everworld and making its way over
here. This streak of azure light was the bearded, disheveled old
‘Realmslord Windgrace’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
one aside from Ning noticed the Realmslord’s arrival.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blacksun truly is remarkable. The Hiddenfiend Realmverse and the
Flamedragon Realmverse are quite far away, but he was able to arrive
in an instant.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. “The Sithe truly
are remarkable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace walked through the air within the Vastheaven Everworld,
quickly arriving outside Vastheaven Palace. “My young friend
Darknorth.” His voice suddenly rang out from outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace has arrived. Come and share a few cups of wine with us,”
Ning said. The barriers parted before the Realmslord, giving him a
passageway inside. Realmslord Windgrace walked through the skies,
following the passageway into Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors within the Darknorth Estate all rose to their
feet. Even the irascible Hegemon Azurefiend rose. The only ones to
remain seated were Ning and Flamewing. “Greetings, Realmslord
Windgrace,” everyone said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Realmslord Windgrace saw that Ning remained seated, he felt quite
intrigued. His face, however, remained completely unruffled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace. Please have a seat.” Ning pointed at a table located
atop a patch of grass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
wine certainly smells nice.” Realmslord Windgrace walked over to
the table, then sat down in the lotus position. He picked up the
gourd of wine and began to guzzle it down. “Delicious, delicious!
Darknorth, my young friend, I hurried here as soon as I heard that
you failed the Daomerge. Alas… the Daomerge for an Omega Dao must
have been incredibly difficult. The Autarchs once told me that no one
has ever been able to succeed in the Daomerge with an Omega Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire area quickly fell silent. The many Hegemons and Emperors no
longer dared to say a word. Su Youji and Pillsaint both sensed how
oppressive and gloomy the atmosphere had become! For Realmslord
Windgrace to immediately raise the topic of Ning failing the Daomerge
meant that he had clearly come on business.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
imagine you already know why I have come here, my young friend
Darknorth.” Realmslord Windgrace looked at Ning. “It would be
very difficult to convince the Flamewing God to willingly serve me…
but if you, his master, agreed to help out then things would be much
simpler. I won’t force you to agree; in the end, it will be your
own choice. If there’s something you desire from me, you merely
need to let me know what you want! I, Windgrace, will definitely do
everything within my power to accomplish it. In fact, I can even
swear a lifeblood oath on it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if you do agree, I won’t take the Flamewing God away immediately.
I’ll wait until you die and your Dao vanishes before doing so.”
Realmslord Windgrace looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAAAR!”
Ning was quite calm, but the happily-eating Flamewing was enraged
upon hearing this. It let out a vicious roar as it transformed into
its true form of a winged, flame-bathed bear, then moved to charge
straight towards Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
good, Flamewing.” Ning’s voice caused Flamewing to come to a
sudden halt. It turned to look rather unhappily at Ning. “Maaaaster!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
good. Just keep eating. Don’t worry about this stuff,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
Flamewing once more transformed into human form, then sat down and
began to eat. Just two mouthfuls in, he once more turned his head to
stare at Ning. “Master, the only one I’ll follow is you. I don’t
like any of the others.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“WINDGRACE!!!”
A cold, clear voice filled with frigid might suddenly rang out,
shaking the skies above Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning, Realmslord Windgrace, and the others all turned to look. They
saw an enormous rift in spacetime appear in the skies above, with an
entire host of figures flying out of it. There were more than fifty
of the titanic onyx humanoids, and they were lined up in orderly
rows. At their head was a pair of golden humanoids, who stood to each
side of a giant, levitating silver throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
silver-robed golden humanoid was seated atop the silver throne. He
stared downwards at the distant Vastheaven Palace with a cold look in
his eyes, and the blood-colored diamond in the middle of his forehead
glared like an icy third eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf led his four Black Emperors to immediately reunite with the
others. Lord Wulf couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.
Thankfully, his Majesty had arrived quite quickly. If he had been
just a few minutes slower, things would’ve become troublesome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
came quite fast.” Realmslord Windgrace’s voice echoed within the
skies above the palace. “And you brought the entire Icepeak Army!
It seems you must’ve been waiting outside the Flamedragon
Realmverse for quite some time now. But… ‘Lonely’, you should
probably know that the soldiers of the Icepeak Army would be throwing
their lives away if they got involved in this. You should have them
hide and avoid getting involved in this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who would take their lives? You?” The Lonely King stared down at
him from atop his throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors inside Vastheaven Palace, the disciples of
Vastheaven Palace, the Eternal Emperors who were watching from within
the Vastheaven Everworld… all of them were completely stunned.
Nobody dared to make a move.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_002__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 2: Struggle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“T-that
many legendary Black Emperors?!” The Eternal Emperors who had
simply been drawn over by the aura Ji Ning had emanated during the
Daomerge were utterly terrified out of their wits when they saw the
Icepeak Army appear. Even the basic soldiers were all at the
Hegemonic level of power, capable of wiping out the ordinary Emperors
with ease… and the three generals had also come, alongside their
leader the Lonely King himself!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that the legendary leader of the Icepeak Army, the Lonely King?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that Daolord Darknorth led the Flamewing God in attacking and
killing quite a few Black Emperors of the Icepeak Army! However, the
Icepeak Army hasn’t responded at all. Now, the Lonely King has
finally appeared.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Both
the Lonely King of the Icepeak Army and Realmslord Windgrace of our
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance has appeared as well. Hmph… they must
have all come for the Flamewing God.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is a legendary Chaos Primordial. Who WOULDN’T want it? Daolord
Darknorth is just a Daolord, but no one would dare to offend him with
the Flamewing God by his side. Now that he has failed his Daomerge,
the Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace have come out to fight over
the beast.” This was what the Eternal Emperors were whispering
mentally to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, they all wanted to just flee, but they were simply too slow.
As for tearing through spacetime? The Icepeak Army emanated invisible
ripples of such incredible power that they simply didn’t have the
courage to do so, for fear that the Icepeak Army might kill them out
of irritation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
ago, during the Dawn War, I encountered and fought far more Sithe
than you have in your puny little Icepeak Army. If I activate the
Blacksun, I’d massacre them all.” Realmslord Windgrace’s voice
was filled with danger: “Lonely, if you are also interested in the
Flamewing God, let’s sit down and have a peaceful little
competition over it. But for you to bring the entire Icepeak Army…
if we actually got into a fight, it’d probably impact the entire
Vastheaven Everworld. If we aren’t careful, the shockwaves might
hit Vastheaven Palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. If I wasn’t able to control my power, there’s no way I
would’ve been able to live as long as I have.” The Lonely King
continued to sit atop his throne as he said coldly, “As for
massacring my Icepeak Army? The only reason you were able to render
so many merits during the Dawn War was because you had many other
major powers helping you out and fighting alongside you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
let’s sit down and talk this over,” Ning said, wine cup in hand.
His voice echoed out and shook the air above the everworld, but did
so via riding alongside the natural ripples of the Dao. He would no
longer use divine power or Immortal energy unless truly necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
get involved. Windgrace and I will decide amongst ourselves who is
superior,” the Lonely King replied coldly. “Come on out,
Realmsgrace. If you don’t come out, I’m going to batter my way
inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Realmslord Windgrace let out an angry snort, then rose to his feet.
“Darknorth, my young friend, let me shoo the Lonely King away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead.” Ning didn’t stand on ceremony. Wine cup in hand, he
simply watched as Realmslord Windgrace flew away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The Lonely King’s silver throne suddenly glowed with
dazzling light which flew out towards the right and left sides of his
throne. There, a second and third Lonely King appeared, all seated on
silver thrones of their own. There were now three Lonely Kings seated
on three silver thrones, and they all looked identical and had
identical auras.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Assemble
the formation!” the Lonely King ordered. Whoosh! The silver
diagrams covering his three Gold Emperor generals all lit up, as did
the silver diagrams covering the many Black Emperors. They had always
emanated dense, frigid auras, but now the aura swept out to form an
entire silver-white wave of ice which roared out in every direction.
The three generals and the many soldiers came together to form a
strange silver formation-diagram, with their bodies being covered by
a layer of silver armor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come.
Let’s see if my Icepeak Army is stronger or if you are, Windgrace,”
the Lonely King said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace strode out of Vastheaven Palace, his eyes narrowing
slightly. In truth, he was quite wary of the Icepeak Army. It
wouldn’t be too hard for him to deal with the Lonely King, but the
Icepeak Army represented an enormous number of opponents. If he
wanted to deal with them, he’d have to activate the Blacksun
multiple times! In addition, to actually kill a Black Emperor would
require the Blacksun to unleash a high level of power each time…
and this would cost him greatly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
felt a 50% degree of confidence in dealing with the Lonely King and
was 100% certain in being able to stay alive… but now that the
entire Icepeak Army was here as well, his chances of victory were 10%
at best, while his chances of staying alive dropped down to 80%-90%.
Fortunately for him, the Lonely King felt rather nervous when faced
with the Blacksun as well. This was why the Lonely King had
immediately used a protective ability to divide himself into three.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
split yourself into three bodies? So long as I wipe out all three of
you, you’ll probably die,” Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
me? Go ahead and try.” The Lonely King’s voice remained as
arrogant and domineering as ever. As soon as he spoke, the blood-red
diamonds in his three foreheads simultaneously shot out rays of
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Swish! Swish! The three blood-red rays of light flew even faster than
Flamewing as they struck out towards Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace remained quite calm. In front of him, a small fist-sized
planet suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This planet was covered with
countless runes, and it rapidly expanded to become thirty meters in
diameter. Boom! Boom! Boom! It effortlessly deflected the attacks of
the three blood-red rays of light. Realmslord Windgrace then walked
straight inside the small planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blacksun.” The Lonely King couldn’t help but feel frustrated. He
had more treasures, but Realmslord Windgrace’s Blacksun was a
terrifying war machine which had allowed the Sithe to influence and
control an entire sector of the battlefield. The controller of the
Blacksun could remain hidden within it in perfect security.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
might have the Blacksun, but he isn’t an actual Sithe; he doesn’t
have their limitless reservoirs of energy. I, on the other hand, have
many tricks up my sleeve. I can have the entire Icepeak Army attack
him. So long as they can surround and entrap the Blacksun, even if he
remains hidden inside it’ll be like he’s in a prison. The only
result will be death,” the Lonely King mused. However, he also knew
that his chances of actually killing Realmslord Windgrace were quite
low, while the cost would be quite high.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
long as I can force Realmslord Windgrace to flee with the Blacksun,
I’ll have won.” The Lonely King knew exactly what he needed to
do. If the Realmslord fled, he felt certain that Daolord Darknorth
would know what decision to make.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
the Lonely King commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The three Lonely Kings on the three silver thrones began to build an
aura of increasing and terrifying power. This aura was so strong that
even Ning, who was calmly drinking wine below them, to grimace
slightly. He raised his head to stare into the skies, then murmured
softly, “The legends say that the Lonely King was once able to
annihilate an entire otherverse. Was this the technique he used? I
can’t let them continue like this. If this fight progresses, they
might accidentally destroy the Vastheaven Everworld.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”
Ning shouted as he rose to his feet, his voice tinged with a hint of
anger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Up
above him were Realmslord Windgrace, the Lonely King, and the Icepeak
Army. They were just about to engage in combat, but all of them
turned to stare blankly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you afraid?” The three Lonely Kings stared downwards and laughed
coldly: “Realmslord cannot kill me, and he doesn’t even know all
the tricks I have available. Faced with my Icepeak Army, he’ll
probably have no choice but to flee. Thus, Daolord Darknorth… I
recommend that you simply go ahead and hand the Flamewing God over to
me and let it serve me. I am the most appropriate master for it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Lonely King had heard of the Blacksun long ago, when he actually
saw Realmslord Windgrace produce it he couldn’t help but feel
uneasy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
same was true for Realmslord Windgrace. When actually faced with the
entire Icepeak Army, he could sense that this would be a truly
vicious battle. It would be best for them to end this without a
fight. Once Daolord Darknorth came out to openly support one side,
the battle would becoming meaningless, because the side who had the
help of the Flamewing God would be the side to win. The Flamewing God
was virtually indestructible, and nothing could withstand its charge.
Even the Blacksun would be knocked aside, while the Icepeak Army
would be torn asunder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you can choose for yourself.” Realmslord Windgrace looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Windgrace made you some promises, I expect?” The Lonely King said
coldly, “But you should know what type of a person I am. No one can
stop me from doing what I want to do. If anyone offends me, I’ll
pay any price needed to exact my revenge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire area descended into a deep silence. All of the Hegemons and
Emperors were quivering inside. They all knew of the Icepeak Army’s
brutal reputation. The Lonely King truly was a terrifying figure when
angered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been waiting a long, long time for that Flamewing God,” the Lonely
King said coldly. “You have failed the Daomerge. Even if you live
with the utmost of caution, you will still be nothing more than a
puny Daolord with at most a thousand chaos cycles of longevity left.
If you make an enemy out of me… I swear that I will annihilate any
friends or family who have any connection to you whatsoever, and I’ll
wipe out your homeland as well. Based on the reports I uncovered, you
first appeared within the Badlands Territory, yes? Back then, you
were just an Elder God! I imagine a puny Elder God couldn’t have
travelled all that far, which means your homeland should be near the
Badlands Territory. Given my power and the power of the Icepeak Army,
we’ll definitely be able to locate it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Lonely Kings stared intently at Ning, the diamonds in their
foreheads glowing with that eerie, evil blood-red light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
trust you know what the right choice is.” The Lonely King all but
palpitated with malevolence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Originally,
Ning had been quite calm… but when he heard the Lonely King
threaten to ‘annihilate any friends or family who have any
connection to you whatsoever’ and say that Ning’s ‘homeland
should be near the Badlands Territory’, a cold look flashed through
Ning’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Snick.
Ning drew a sword from the black sheath on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What,
are you about to go crazy? I hear that some Daolords who failed the
Daomerge will cast caution to the wind and go berserk… but not even
your Flamewing God is able to harm me in the slightest. No matter
what, I’ll be able to annihilate everyone and everything you care
about!” Murder all but radiated from the Lonely King’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning took a single step forwards, his body flickering as he moved so
fast he vastly surpassed both the Flamewing God and the light which
had shot out of those blood-red diamonds. He appeared right next to
the left-most Lonely King, and he delivered a casual chopping blow
with his Northbow sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
It was an ordinary strike which even the distant Hegemons and Eternal
Emperors were able to see with clarity. It seemed so very slow, but
it sliced through the Lonely King’s neck with ease, cutting through
his silver robes and even his golden body as though they were made
out of tofu. The cut was so clean that one couldn’t even see a
wound actually appear on the Lonely King’s neck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
attack looked slow, but that was just a deceptive illusion caused by
the temporal disruption inherent to this strike. In truth, it was so
fast that no one was able to react at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
the Lonely King’s eyes bulged out. An invisible power struck at him
through karma, instantly wiping out his soul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
his current level, Ning didn’t need to worry about which of the
three was the ‘real’ one; Ning’s sword was connected to karma
itself. Even if the ‘true’ Lonely King was hidden away in a
completely different realmverse or otherverse, he still would have
perished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King’s bulging eyes suddenly softened. A look of release
appeared in his gaze, and his lips actually curved upwards in a
smile. Moments later, his aura completely vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
three Lonely Kings slumped downwards. Two of them completely
vanished, while the other lay fallen atop his silver throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced sideways at the already-perished Lonely King, then murmured
softly, “You are right. As a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge,
there’s a limit to how long I can live. I really didn’t want to
use up any energy… but once you made those threats, I had no choice
but to respond.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Snick.
Ning resheathed the Northbow sword back into the scabbard on his
back.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_003__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 3: Accept Punishment</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning stared weighingly at the Lonely King’s silver robes, his
blood-red diamond, and the silver throne he had been seated on. These
were all extremely powerful Sithe weapons. They were of little use to
him, but of incalculable value to others. He immediately waved his
hand, collecting the Lonely King’s corpse, throne, and treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire area was completely silent. The skies above Vastheaven Palace
had previously been the arena for the face-off between Realmslord
Windgrace and the Icepeak Army. Moments ago, their auras had been
flaring… but now, all of them held their breaths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
terrified Emperors who were watching from afar were all staring in
disbelief. Even the people inside Vastheaven Palace such as Emperor
Solesky, Hegemon Azurefiend, and the Flamewing God all stared with
heads upraised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this moment, every single cultivator’s attention was completely
focused upon the white-robed youth with the black sheath on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
aura was quite ordinary, the aura of a Daolord. One could even sense
that his truesoul was continuously crumbling away in tiny amounts. He
was nothing more than a pitiful Daolord who had failed the Daomerge,
but…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
all watched blankly as the white-robed figure collected the Lonely
King’s Sithe weapons. No one dared to stop him, even though they
were deeply interested in those treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…
h-he…” Su Youji stared with her head raised. Her eyes were
brimming with tears, and her face was red with excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
felt excited for Ning! She could still remember the first time they
had met. Back then, he had been an Elder God while she had been an
Ancestral Immortal. She had already been incomparably beautiful, with
many cultivators wooing her in the hopes of becoming her
Dao-companion. When she had met Ning, she had watched as Ning battled
above his class against World-level cultivators, and thus she had
immediately chosen to voluntarily join him as his retainer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
had followed him, watching him grow from up close. He had become
increasingly dazzling, becoming the number one Daolord in all the
history of the Flamedragon Realmverse. He had taken on a Hegemonic
retainer and even tamed the Flamewing God… but in the end, he had
still failed his Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
felt a sense of great heartache and sorrow as she watched her
master’s truesoul slowly but surely crumble away… but then she
saw that single, dazzling sword-strike. The Lonely King, someone who
even Hegemons viewed with reverence, had collapsed supinely beneath
that strike. First, Su Youji had felt stunned. Then, she had felt a
true sense of excitement and delight for her master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
though he has failed the Daomerge, he’ll become the most dazzling
star in all the night sky. Even though he will one day perish, his
light shall illuminate countless realmverses and otherverses, and be
forever whispered unto the end of time. He shall become one of the
most unbelievable of legends.” Su Youji stared upwards at him, her
eyes blazing with eagerness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power! H-how could he have… how…” Emperor Solesky mumbled
nonsensically to himself as he stared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Lonely King? Finished with just one strike of the sword?” Hegemon
Azurefiend’s wizened old face was contorted with shock. “I’ve
wandered the vast Chaosverse for many years, but I’ve never even
heard of such a thing. Most likely, only the exalted Autarchs or
perhaps the supreme members of the Sithe race, those Exalts, would be
capable of such a thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the cultivator civilizations, the only ones capable of such an act
were the Autarchs. Although the Sithe Exalts were weaker than the
Autarchs, they were still definitely above the Otherverse Lords in
power. They were unfathomably powerful and even faster than the
Flamewing God. In a direct clash, the Flamewing God would be
suppressed by a Sithe Exalt even though Flamewing had an
indestructible body! Three Exalts working together had actually
managed to capture it alive. In the cultivator civilizations, only
Autarchs were capable of capturing Chaos Primordials.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now…
a Daolord who had failed the Daomerge had actually reached that same,
terrifying level of power?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
powerful was he? Was he comparable to those Sithe Exalts, or was he
even stronger than them and close to the Autarchs in might? The
Hegemons and Emperors had no idea, and it didn’t really matter. The
only thing that mattered was this truth: Hegemons and Otherverse
Lords would all perish with just one strike from Ning’s sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Ning collected the Lonely King’s treasures, he swept the area with
his gaze, then smiled. “Realmslord Windgrace and the Icepeak Army,
please follow me. As for the other Emperors and Hegemons, you’ll
have to pardon me; I won’t be able to accompany you for now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are being far too courteous, Daolord Darknorth.” The ordinary
Eternal Emperors off in the distance all felt surprised and delighted
by his courtesy. They all relaxed quite a bit. Normally, they had to
behave with great reverence when they were in the presence of
Hegemons. This truly peerless Daolord had just slain the Lonely King
with ease and was so powerful that even Hegemons wouldn’t dare to
breathe too loudly in front of him, and yet he spoke with such
courtesy!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, I truly have never even heard of sword-arts like yours.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
truly impressive. I, Daoist Violetstar, have truly been enlightened
today. I’ve wandered for over ten million chaos cycles and visited
many realmverses, but I’ve never been as stunned as I am right now.
Even if I died the very next instant, I would still feel that it
would all have been worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, we won’t bother you any further.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
leave now.” The Emperors still felt a mixture of reverence and
fear. Right now, they were even more nervous when facing Daolord
Darknorth than they had been when facing Realmslord Windgrace or the
Lonely King.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply smiled, watching as the Emperors all departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, Daoist Bluestone,
and a number of others all flew over. The others all felt rather
nervous, but Hegemon Brightshore had always been on very good terms
with Ning. As a result, he felt a bit more relaxed. His ancient eyes
were filled with a look of amazement, and he let out a sigh:
“Darknorth, after seeing your sword… I still feel panic in my
heart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t want to draw my sword,” Ning said. “But the Lonely King
was protected by Sithe artifacts. If I didn’t draw my sword, I
wouldn’t be able to kill him. Using my weapons and exerting my
energy will result in my truesoul crumbling even faster.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Correct.”
Hegemon Brightshore nodded. “From now on, you should avoid fighting
whenever possible. Your sword-arts truly are dazzling to behold! A
pity that we won’t be able to see it too many times in the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
win some, you lose some. All you can do is meet it with a calm
heart,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth?”
Daoist Bluestone smiled. “You said that you had to draw your sword
if you wanted to kill the Lonely King. Are you saying that you
wouldn’t even need to draw your sword to deal with us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Correct.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might not need to draw your sword, but you’d still need to use up a
bit of energy to deal with us,” Emperor Goldisle said with a
chortle. “So it’s best if you don’t just go crazy and start
killing everyone, Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goldisle,
I won’t go crazy anytime soon, but… generally speaking, I should
be able to kill my foes just by activating the might of my Dao.
There’s no need for me to actually use up any of my divine power or
Immortal energy,” Ning said. If one didn’t use one’s weapons,
divine power, or Immortal energy, the amount of power that one could
summon simply from the might of his Dao itself was quite low.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
Ning’s Dao was the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, and it represented the
true prime essence of the Dao of the Sword itself! The domain
generated by his Dao might not be able to kill the likes of the
Lonely King, nor would it be enough to kill Otherverse Lords who were
protected by the prime essences of their own otherverses, but it was
more than capable of killing ordinary Hegemons. Ning wouldn’t need
to use up any of his own power at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
A sour look appeared on Goldisle’s face. “Can’t you let us save
just a tiny bit of face?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
enough chit-chat. I need to go speak with Windgrace and the Icepeak
Army,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
We’ll head off then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
there’s anything you need, just send word. We’ll definitely help
out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
off.” The supreme powers of the Flamedragon Realmverse began to
leave, their hearts filled with mixed emotions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, by now they were able to guess that the reason why Ning was so
strong was most likely due to him being in control of the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao. But… he had also failed the Daomerge. There was no
doubt about that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a true pity. A peerless major power is going to slowly fade away, and
there’s nothing anyone can do.” Hegemon Windrain sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
won’t be able to see his dazzling sword-arts many more times in the
future. It will eventually become nothing more than a myth,”
Hegemon Netherlily said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply stood there. It was for Realmslord Windgrace and the Icepeak
Army to come meet him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” A look of shock was in Realmslord Windgrace’s eyes,
and he actually bowed slightly. “I truly am stunned by the
sword-arts I just saw. The Autarchs might be powerful, but their
power comes from their Daobirth, where ‘one Dao births many Daos’.
As far as the pure Dao of the Sword goes… you, Daolord Darknorth,
are number one in all the Chaosverse. I was a bit too arrogant when I
came and asked for the Flamewing God; I’d like to ask you to pardon
me. If there’s anything you need, just let me know. If you wish to
punish me for my impertinence, I’m willing to accept it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. No one had ever gained eternity for an Omega Dao in all of
history; he was the first. That meant he was naturally the first to
be the master of an Eternal Omega Sword Dao. He truly was the number
one master of the sword in the entire history of the Chaosverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Windgrace.
Icepeak Army.” Ning’s gaze turned to the nearby members of the
Icepeak Army. The three Gold Emperors and the many Black Emperors of
the Icepeak Army all felt very nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Daolord Darknorth. We truly are ashamed to have offended
you by our actions, and we too are willing to accept any punishment
you may mete out. Now that you have slain the Lonely King, we
actually feel a sense of gratitude in our hearts,” Lord Wulf said
respectfully. “Myself, brother Wei, and brother Solefinger, along
with the many Black Emperors under our command… although we gained
the power of Gold Emperors and Black Emperors and became much more
powerful, we lost something as well. Our lives fell under the
complete control of the Lonely King, and we have never dared to
oppose his commands. Now that you have slain the Lonely King, we have
finally been released.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “I won’t punish any of you… but there is something I
need you all to do for me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
tell us what you need, Daolord Darknorth.” The three generals and
the many Black Emperors all respectfully awaited Ning’s orders.</P>

Chapter 4: Searching For Nuwa</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wish to find a female cultivator,” Ji Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Find
a female cultivator?” The three generals and the Black Emperors
were all rather puzzled, as was the nearby Realmslord Windgrace. They
all knew that Ning had trained for a fairly brief period of time and
hadn’t travelled to many places; it should be easy for him to find
a female cultivator. There was no need to send the entire Icepeak
Army to carry out a task like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Her
name is Nuwa,” Ning said. “She hasn’t trained for very long
either, and she should be incredibly talented. She might be a
Daolord, but she might also have become an Eternal Emperor. She is
most likely located in a place which is extremely far away from the
Flamedragon Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
hadn’t visited too many places, but he had accumulated records on
all the Daolords and Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.
There had been no records of Nuwa at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
ever since Nuwa left the Three Realms she had never again appeared
within the territory of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. After Ning
had mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, he had reached an
inconceivably high level of insight. He was now in control of one of
the prime essences of the Chaosverse, the prime essence of the Dao of
the Sword. In other words, he now had a vague understanding of how
the entire Chaosverse itself functioned, giving him a greater degree
of insight into fate! Mother Nuwa and Ning were connected to each
other by karma, because the very first step Ning had taken as a
mortal… was to study the [Nuwa Painting]!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Ning had completed and mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, he was
able to sense through the whispers of fate that Nuwa was still alive
in an extremely remote part of the Chaosverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa?”
The three generals, Realmslord Windgrace, and the Black Emperors all
revealed puzzled expressions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of you have heard of her?” Ning couldn’t help but feel a bit
disappointed when he saw the looks on their faces. Realmslord
Windgrace had many friends but was permanently stationed in the
Hiddenfiend Realmverse; it wasn’t surprising that he hadn’t heard
of Nuwa. The Icepeak Army, however, roved the Chaosverse and visited
many places. Ning had thought that they might have heard of her,
especially since Ning felt certain that Nuwa’s level of talent must
have led her to accomplish great things!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that when the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld collided, that represented the smashing together of two
Autarch-level godgems. In the resulting battle, Nuwa had broken
through to the World level! Karmic luck had descended upon her,
resulting in a great deal of the essence fragments of the Autarch’s
godgems to swirl around her as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was incredibly rare and marvelous for a cultivator to break through
to the World level without any guidance whatsoever. Even Ning had
merely been at the Elder God/Ancestral Immortal level when he left
the Three Realms. True, Ning had only trained for a fairly brief
period of time… but Mother Nuwa was definitely in a class of her
own during the ‘Primordial Era’ of the Pangu Chaosworld. She had
definitely surpassed the Three Sovereigns, Tathagata, Three Purities,
and Subhuti, and she was the unquestioned leader of the Nuwa
Alliance. By now, even Subhuti and Windfiend had fused multiple
Supreme Daos together. Ning felt certain that Nuwa wouldn’t be
inferior to any of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
meant that Nuwa would probably be quite famous in the region she was
currently in! If the Icepeak Army had visited her region, it was
highly likely that they would’ve heard mention of the name ‘Nuwa’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haven’t
heard of her.” Lord Wulf shook his head, then turned and barked,
“Have any of you heard of a ‘Nuwa’ before?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
roamed through many places, but we’ve never heard of a powerful
female cultivator named Nuwa.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haven’t
heard of her.” They all shook their heads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to look at Realmslord Windgrace, who immediately shook his
head. “I haven’t heard of her either. Daolord Darknorth, the
Icepeak Army has visited many places. If even they haven’t heard of
her, she’s not going to be easy to find.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. “Nuwa has only trained for a short period of time; perhaps
she isn’t well-known yet. Icepeak Army, the mission I have for you
is for you to ride realmships to one realmverse after another. Spread
the word on my behalf! Say that I, Daolord Darknorth, am searching
for a female cultivator named ‘Nuwa’. She should have only been
training for roughly a hundred chaos cycles of ‘normal’ time. You
can also make it known that I, Daolord Darknorth, will owe a debt to
the first person to find Nuwa for me. I can use treasures to pay off
my debt, but I can also help deal with someone… such as the Lonely
King, who I slew!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This…”
Realmslord Windgrace and the Icepeak Army were shocked. This offer
was a crazy one. The Lonely King had been an incredible figure in the
Chaosverse, a mighty ruler in his sector. Daolord Darknorth’s
promise was definitely enough to drive many major powers wild with
excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
favor from Daolord Darknorth was definitely something worth having!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and spread the word to as many realmverses as you can. This is the
only task I have for you,” Ning said. “Once I find Nuwa, you’ll
gain your freedom. If I cannot find her, then you’ll be released
from this oath after I die and my Dao vanishes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Daolord Darknorth.” The three generals and the Black
Emperors all immediately agreed. This was an incredibly simple task;
all they had to do was serve as a messenger! Daolord Darknorth wasn’t
going to be around for much longer; at most, he’d survive for
another thousand chaos cycles. This was quite easy. The Icepeak Army
immediately swore the requisite lifeblood oaths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
now. If anyone discovers Nuwa, they can immediately inform Windgrace.
When he knows, I’ll know,” Ning said. In the end, he himself
simply didn’t know enough people. Even if someone did locate Nuwa,
it would be quite difficult for that person to find Ning. Windgrace,
however, had a wide network of friends; it would be far easier for
others to reach him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The members of the Icepeak Army all assented to his order, then
excitedly departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could they not be excited? This wasn’t the calamitous punishment
they had expected; in fact, it was a huge blessing in disguise! Now
that the Lonely King was dead, their lives were their own again. They
would truly be free once more. How many major powers were truly
willing to serve as pawns and footsoldiers for another? Long ago,
they had been weak and thus lusted after the power which becoming a
Black Emperor or Gold Emperor would grant them, which was why they
had gritted their teeth and accepted servitude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now?
They didn’t lose any of the power they had gained, nor was their
fate in the hands of another. They were all free. Wasn’t this a
wonderful thing? And once they helped Daolord Darknorth locate
‘Nuwa’, they would become truly and perpetually free.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Windgrace.”
Ning looked at Windgrace. “You can probably guess what I need you
to do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
simple task. I’ll send the word out as widely as I can,”
Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
Ning nodded. “Sorry to trouble you, Realmslord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tis
nothing at all.” Realmslord Windgrace secretly let out a sigh of
relief as well. Daolord Darknorth truly was an easy-going person.
Many cultivators in his position would behave much more ruthlessly!
Given that Ning had already failed the Daomerge, no one would’ve
been surprised if he had turned ruthless and chose to simply kill
Windgrace. If that happened, Windgrace wouldn’t even have had a
chance to feel regret! Thus, he had waited nervously for Ning’s
judgment, not daring to argue in the slightest. But now, it seemed,
Ning’s request was quite simple. All he had to do was to spread the
word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
story of the legendary battle which occurred after Daolord
Darknorth’s attempted Daomerge was quickly spread by Realmslord
Windgrace, the Hegemons and Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance, and the Icepeak Army. The latter rode realmships in every
direction, spreading the news far and wide. As a result, word spread
like a tempest!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Chaosverse was so vast that spreading information was usually
quite difficult, this particular bit of news was utterly astonishing,
especially given how famous the Lonely King was. As a result, news
truly did spread quite fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
man! Old man! A giant foot came crashing down through the clouds and
slamming against the surface of an enormous planet, causing the earth
to tremble. The towering figure to which the giant foot belonged
continued to bellow, “Hurry up and wake up, you blind old man!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“FUCK
OFF!” a hoarse, ear-piercing voice rang out from deep underneath
the earth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and wake up! Something big just happened. Stop sleeping! This
time, the towering figure stomped down on the ground using his two
bare feet, causing the earth to shudder and shake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
day, I’m going to EAT you,” the hoarse, unpleasant voice said. A
boom rang out, followed by the entire planet exploding as an ugly
black bird appeared in its center. This bird had just a single eye,
but the eye was shut. It looked rather like an owl, but it had a pair
of extremely large black wings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
got some good news for you, you blind old man! A while ago, the
Lonely King sent the Icepeak Army after you and forced you into
fleeing, right?” The speaker was an alien Hegemon dressed in simple
armor and who had two furry heads. “The Lonely King died!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
are you mentioning this again? I TOLD you to never… huh? Did you
just say the Lonely King died?” The black avian let out a startled,
ear-piercing screech.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
true! Word has spread to our Fivebug Realmverses. You’re probably
the only one who doesn’t know because you spend all your time
sleeping!” the two-headed Hegemon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How’d
he die?” the black avian immediately asked. “Given how strong the
Lonely King was, so long as he didn’t do anything suicidal there
shouldn’t be anyone capable of killing him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh heh… I have to tell you a story about someone truly remarkable
named Daolord Darknorth.” The two-headed Hegemon immediately began
to narrate the story.</P>

Chapter 5: Arrangements</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a different, incredibly distant part of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
vast layer of golden clouds could be seen here within the emptiness
of space. Above the clouds, there were many divine palaces that
emanated rays of golden light. The palaces were all connected
together and emanated such incredible light that it illuminated the
cosmos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a side room inside the tallest, most towering palace. A white-winged
man was standing by himself, staring into the endless darkness
outside his window. He said calmly, “Demon Empress, why have you
come here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
person was within the room, a blood-winged woman with a single horn.
She had a smile on her face that was filled with strange, beguiling
charisma. “God Emperor Helong, we were once Dao-companions. Why
must you be so heartless to me? For the sake of your Dao, of your
[God Emperor’s Apocalypse], you were willing to give up even your
Dao-companions. Even if you do succeed in becoming an Autarch, would
it all be worth it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Karma
brought us into each other’s path, then took us away from each
other. Our ties are ended,” God Emperor Helong said calmly. “No
need to waste time on such nonsense. Why have you come here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
always thought of yourself as being an extraordinary figure,” the
blood-winged woman smirked, “But have you heard of someone known as
‘Daolord Darknorth’?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth. A Daolord?” God Emperor Helong was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
I knew you wouldn’t know.” The blood-winged woman said, “While
meeting with a few of my friends, I heard some interesting news. You
should’ve heard of the Lonely King of the Icepeak Army, yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">God
Emperor Helong said coldly, “He was destroyed by his love and went
insane. He’s not worth discussing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
he was still fairly strong,” the blood-winged woman laughed. “Are
you able to kill him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
engaged in the Ritual Sacrificium to become a Golden Emperor, and is
also protected by multiple Sithe war machines. I heard that he once
destroyed an otherverse. I admit that he’s quite strong. Killing
him would be very difficult… but someone like him, who purely
focuses on power, will have a Dao-heart which is riddled with flaws,”
God Emperor Helong said disdainfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daolord Darknorth I just mentioned to you? He killed the Lonely King
with just one swing of his sword,” the blood-winged woman said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible!”
God Emperor Helong’s face completely changed. “Impossible.
There’s no way it could be done with one strike, and no way it
could be done by a Daolord! One would at least have to have the power
of a Sithe Exalt to accomplish this!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blood-winged woman said, “Let me finish. Daolord Darknorth is an
incredibly talented figure, and he trains in one of the legendary
Omega Daos. He convinced a Hegemon to follow him as a retainer, and
also tamed a Chaos Primordial! Not long ago he finally attempted the
Daomerge! Although he failed in the Daomerge, the failure allowed him
to truly understand and comprehend the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, and
so he used just one strike of his sword to slay the Lonely King, who
had come to take his Chaos Primordial from him. Realmslord Windgrace
and the Icepeak Army were so terrified that they immediately moved to
obey all his commands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eternal
Omega Sword Dao?” God Emperor Helong was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
always someone stronger than the strongest! Even in the cultivator
civilizations, there are now those aside from the Autarchs who are
more powerful than you, such as Daolord Darknorth.” The
blood-winged woman smirked. “Do you still think you are all that
extraordinary? You aren’t even close to being his equal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Omega Dao can actually be perfected into eternity?” A stunned look
was in God Emperor Helong’s eyes. “Incredible, simply incredible.
I truly am not a match for him. I, Helong, have only ever admired the
Autarchs. Now, I also feel admiration for Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
woman was stunned. She had wanted to use the story of Daolord
Darknorth to belittle the endlessly arrogant God Emperor. Who
would’ve thought that Helong would immediately begin to feel
admiration for Daolord Darknorth?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I could borrow his Eternal Omega Sword Dao and study from it, how
wonderful that would be!” the God Emperor murmured softly,
eagerness in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
dreaming. The Dao is not to be casually taught to others, and only
Daolord Darknorth has ever successfully mastered the Eternal Omega
Sword Dao! You can stop dreaming about it,” the woman mocked.
However, she didn’t see any anger or frustration on God Emperor
Helong’s face. This displeased her greatly, causing her to turn and
leave. Still… at least she had achieved her goal of mocking the
man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Twelve Palaces of Brightshore, especially the Sword Palace, were
filled with just as many excited discussions as the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that our Palace Lord Darknorth has already been praised as the
number one expert of the Endless Territories.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right.
The Eternal Emperors all seem to be talking about this. Palace Lord
Darknorth failed in the Daomerge, but he has actually reached an
inconceivable level of power as a result of it. Even Hegemons are far
beneath him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
Hegemons are far beneath him? How powerful must he be?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Daolords of the Sword Palace didn’t really know the details or
what the Icepeak Army was, there had been so many Emperors present
watching the battle that details of it had quickly leaked. Thus, the
Daolords all knew one thing – Daolord Darknorth might have failed
the Daomerge, but he was so powerful that he surpassed even the
Hegemons by a great amount. He was able to kill Hegemons with a flick
of his wrist! This caused the countless Daolords to feel stunned, and
the Daolords of the Sword Palace were especially proud.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
Hegemons are far beneath him?” The Universe treasure within
Armaments Gorge, the broken sword, suddenly manifested a pink-robed
woman above the sword. She was the sword’s spirit, and she couldn’t
believe this news. “How can someone be more powerful than a
Hegemon? Are we talking about that silly Daolord who visited me
twice?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Even if it’s true… so what? He failed his Daomerge, which means
he will die soon,” the sword-spirit murmured to herself. “Besides…
given how he asked me to join him last time, he probably still
doesn’t have any Universe treasures. Hmph.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many major powers in the vast Chaosverse, including the Hegemons, the
Emperors, and other incredibly famous ancient figures who were on par
with Realmslord Windgrace and the Lonely King, were all stunned by
the news they heard regarding this ‘Daolord Darknorth’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
weaker ones were able to gain a general sense of how terrifying
Daolord Darknorth was… but only the strongest ones truly understood
what the ‘Eternal Omega Sword Dao’ truly represented! All of them
knew that Daolord Darknorth was most likely second only to the
Autarchs in all the parts of the Chaosverse ruled over by the
cultivator civilizations! Even though he failed the Daomerge and his
life would be brief as a result, no one would dare to challenge him
so long as he was alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
legend of Daolord Darknorth only continued to grow… as did a second
person’s name. ‘Nuwa’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Darknorth was searching for a female cultivator called Nuwa. The
first person to find her and send word of her to Daolord Darknorth
would be owed a favor by the Daolord! Such a favor had tremendous
uses and implications.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you heard of a powerful female cultivator named Nuwa?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
incredible Daolord or a powerful Hegemon? Never heard of her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Based
on what Daolord Darknorth has told us, Nuwa has probably only trained
for a hundred chaos cycles or so. She can’t be all that strong.
Maybe she’s already dead?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
Think about the level which Daolord Darknorth has reached; he’s
second only to the Autarchs! How could he be mistaken about her being
alive?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">News
continued to spread.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumors
continued to bubble and froth in the outside world. By now,
Vastheaven Palace had become something of a holy place, the most

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, was busy taking care of many things he had to handle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning and his team rode the realmship into the Terror Starsea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master?”
Flamewing looked at Ning, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Ning stared up front.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are?” Hegemon Azurefiend stared towards the front as well,
puzzled. The only thing in front of them was an area of jumbled
primordial chaos. “There’s nothing in front of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
cave is hidden there,” Ning said with a laugh, “And it holds a
world where my third disciple, Skywind, resides. I’ll go in first.”
As he spoke, he took a single step forwards and disappeared from the
realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
mastery over the Dao of Spacetime was such that he was able to easily
enter the cave within that hidden pocket of spacetime, while his
sword-light was even more easily capable of cutting a hole into it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Same
old cave.” Ning swept the area with his gaze. He saw the two
Hegemon’s corpses as well as the Black Emperor’s corpse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Disciple.”
Ning stared into the Black Emperor’s corpse. His gaze pierced
through the dimensions, allowing him to see Daolord Skywind within a
planet inside that corpse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have several disciples… but you, alas, have the toughest destiny,”
Ning sighed softly. His mastery over the Dao of Karma had long ago
reached the Archon level. Now that he had mastered the Eternal Omega
Sword Dao, he was able to see even farther into the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
future was in a constant state of flux, but he was now able to see
the vast majority of possible futures. Now that he had failed his
Daomerge, he turned to focus on preparing things for his family and
friends. As for the Three Realms, he had naturally spent even more
effort there. He was searching for Nuwa for the sake of the Three
Realms. As Ning saw it, Mother Nuwa had to be fairly powerful and was
most likely capable of helping out and protecting it. Ning was
planning to give the Sithe war machines he had acquired from the
Lonely King over to Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for his disciples? His first disciple, Bluecliff Xiaoyu, lived a
carefree life, but as a result she had accomplished the least. There
was no need to discuss her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
second disciple was ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding. Ning had engaged
in some divinations on his behalf and had discovered that Yang Quding
was a person of remarkable mental prowess. He would be able to solve
even the most dangerous of problems, and he was surrounded by great
luck. His future potential was virtually limitless; most likely, he
would become the most accomplished of Ning’s disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
third disciple was Skywind. Skywind was the best-suited to the Dao of
the Sword, but he was stubborn and antisocial, and he was the most
vicious of his peers. That stubborn, eccentric personality would
bring him many problems. Ning had scried the future, and it appeared
as though Skywind would be incredibly dazzling amongst the other
Daolords of the Fourth Step, but he would be constantly surrounded by
trouble. The ties of karma surrounding him indicated that he would
actually fail his Daomerge without question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was much like how Emperor Waveshift had once divined that Ning would
definitely fail the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
fourth disciple… to this very day, no one had acquired the legacy
Ning had hidden, the legacy which would result in that person
becoming Ning’s fourth disciple. Ning had the vague feeling that
his fourth disciple would not be born for a long, long time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
fifth and sixth disciples were both at Vastheaven Palace and so were
blessed with many advantages. There was no need for Ning to worry
about them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skywind,”
Ning murmured softly, “Everyone chooses their own paths in life.
The only thing I can do to help you is this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved a finger. Countless streams of sword-light began to gather
together, coming to form a formation. Ning placed some presents
inside the formation, which had many illusions and other tempering
techniques within them. It also included various techniques involving
the Dao of the Sword, some spirit-fruits and treasures, as well as
treasures which were unremarkable to Ning but which would be of
tremendous help to Skywind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
all my disciples, the one I worry about the most is you.” Ning
shook his head slowly. “However… in the end, I’ll still have to
eventually let go.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_006__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 6: Nuwa’s Trail</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was a limit to how much longer he would live. He certainly wouldn’t
be able to hold on until Skywind’s Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King had said that if Ji Ning was extremely careful, he’d be
able to live a thousand chaos cycles… but in truth, Ning knew that
his Eternal Omega Sword Dao was actually the same thing as the prime
essence of the Dao of the Sword, one of the prime essences of the
Chaosverse. This Dao had a nurturing effect on his soul, which meant
that the truesoul’s crumbling speed would be fairly slow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Different
Daos would have different effects. For example, those who trained in
the Dao of Water would have stronger protective abilities and
invulnerable forms. In turn, the destructive Daos such as the Dao of
the Sword were superior in offensive power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Different
Daos had different strengths. Although the Eternal Omega Sword Dao
was quite incredible, it still represented the Dao of the Sword and
thus it didn’t have an exaggeratedly massive effect on the soul.
Still, there was something else that was special about Ning – the
azureflower mist energy! This was a very unique type of energy which
Autarch Awakener, the master of the Azureflower Estate, had devised
based on the cultivation methods of the Sithe race. It was a
technique that allowed for divine power, Immortal energy, and
heartforce to all be transformed into azureflower mist energy. It had
marvelous effects on the truesoul and made it much stronger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I can avoid using up my energy, I can live a maximum of eight
thousand chaos cycles,” Ning mused. “But if I have to use my
energy, my lifespan will dramatically lessen to just three or four
chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
spent the rest of his time in Vastheaven Palace training his students
and fellow disciples. Every so often, he’d go roaming through the
Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
he wandered through the many chaosworlds of the Three Realms, Ning
ended up choosing a seventh disciple. His seventh disciple was an
Ancestral Immortal who had been known as ‘Grand Immortal Almonder’,
and who had been a plant-spirit who had trained to the point of
understanding the Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that after such a long period of development, the
Three Realms now had so many chaosworlds and experts that a single
Ancestral Immortal truly didn’t count for much. Grand Immortal
Almonder had a very eccentric personality who rather reminded Ning of
his old friend, Patriarch Lu Dongbin… because the man loved to play
matchmaker!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
tweaked events to ensure that lovers met with each other, and when he
encountered people he didn’t like he would play all sorts of tricks
on each other. In fact, he would sometimes make people he truly
disliked end up attached to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
wandering the Three Realms, Ning stumbled upon this ‘Grand Immortal
Almonder’. He followed Almonder in secret, watching for some time.
Almonder seemed to be eccentric and rather lazy when it came to
cultivation. It seemed obvious to many that he would have no future
prospects, which was why none of the Daolords or World-level
cultivators of the Three Realms had taken him on as a disciple or had
taught him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning had the feeling that this ‘Grand Immortal Almonder’ was an
extraordinary figure. When Ning scried his future, Ning came to
understand that Almonder truly was a piece of unpolished jade. Given
that Ning had slowly grown fond of the young fellow, Ning chose to
take him on as a seventh disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">News
that Daolord Darknorth had taken on a seventh disciple, ‘Grand
Immortal Almonder’, stunned the Three Realms and caused quite a few
Immortals and Fiendgods to stare blankly in confusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lived a relaxed life, waiting for news of Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Roughly
69 million years after Ning’s Daomerge attempt. Within an alternate
universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
giant boulder was levitating within an empty patch of space. Two
major powers were seated in the lotus position atop this boulder,
drinking wine and making merry. The empty area around them was
displaying images of various things occurring within this otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Isn’t
Daolord Darknorth just incredible?” the muscular man with tousled
golden hair said with a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
really is. If you didn’t tell me about him, I wouldn’t even know
about it. I really cannot imagine that someone was able to kill the
legendary Lonely King of the Icepeak Army with just one blow of the
sword. He truly is incredible.” The bald, red-robed Hegemon
Goodsong nodded and sighed, “I was stunned when I heard this. I
wish I was there to witness it all in person! Haha.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
Daolord Darknorth is in the Flamedragon Realmverse. That place is
way, way too far away from us. You’d have to travel through several
incredibly vast stretches of the Great Dark to get there. I’m
surprised the news even made it this far. I’m an Otherverse Lord
with quite a few friends, which is why I heard about this,” the
muscular man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is far.” The bald, red-robed man nodded. Some realmverses
were fairly close to each other; realmships could allow you to travel
between them in just a few tens of thousands of years. Others were
hundreds of times farther away, separated by that endless darkness
with no realmverses inside which many cultivators referred to as the
Great Dark. To Emperors who weren’t willing to pay for travel via
realmship, traversing the Great Dark would simply take too much time;
tens of millions of chaos cycles, or even longer! Most weren’t
willing to travel too far.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right! There’s something I forgot to tell you. Daolord Darknorth is
searching for someone called Nuwa.” The muscular man laughed. “He
said that he would owe a favor to anyone who does find Nuwa. He’d
be willing to hand over a treasure, or even help carry out a task…
including a task like killing major powers on the level of the Lonely
King.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa?
Who is Nuwa?” Hegemon Goodsong asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
female cultivator who supposedly has only trained for a hundred chaos
cycles. Daolord Darknorth says that she’s probably an incredibly
talented Daolord or an Eternal Emperor,” the muscular man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
Hegemon Goodsong began to feel excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
hour later, the red-robed Hegemon Goodsong left the otherverse and
reached another realmverse which was connected to the former via a
spacetime tunnel. By now, he was no longer able to suppress his
excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa?
A female cultivator who has only trained for a hundred chaos cycles?”
Hegemon Goodsong narrowed his eyes. “Last time, when I met with
Patriarch Treewind of the Bluesky Realmverse, he brought a female
disciple named ‘Nuwa’. Back then, he praised her multiple times
and described her as being incredibly talented. She was just a
Daolord of the Third Step back then; I wonder how she is doing now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go and take a look. She’s probably the person Daolord Darknorth of
the Flamedragon Realmverse is searching for.” Hegemon Goodsong
immediately went off to go hire a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmship
owners generally charged the same for a hundred million year flight
as they would a hundred thousand year flight. They were only hired
every so often, after all; they had to make the most of it. Thus,
this trip ‘merely’ cost Hegemon Goodsong roughly 30% of his
networth. Although he felt sorrow over the cost, it was within the
limits of what he could accept.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Goodsong, we just reached the Bluesky Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait
for me here as I go test out the information I heard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. It only took me three million years to get here; I’ll fly
you around until the hundred million years are up.” The Hegemon in
command of the realmship was quite relaxed; to earn so much treasure
in exchange for merely a hundred million years of his time was an
absolute steal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Goodsong went off searching. Soon, he found Patriarch Treewind’s
residence. A handsome young disciple was in front of Patriarch
Treewind’s tree palace, and this disciple respectfully welcomed
Hegemon Goodsong inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon,
the Patriach has gone off on a trip to the Blazesun Domain,” the
disciple said respectfully. “His avatar has left this place to go
meet with the avatars of his friends to ensure that they are in
constant contact. Almost all of them have gone off to the Blazesun
Domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Domain? Your Patriarch is quite bold. Where is that female
disciple of his, ‘Nuwa’?” Hegemon Goodsong immediately asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Nuwa?” The youth was startled. He immediately
responded. “Don’t you know? Half a chaos cycle ago, she completed
her Daomerge and became a Hegemon. It was her recommendation that
they visit the Blazesun Domain. After the Patriarch and the other
major powers agreed, they joined together to accompany her there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“She
became a Hegemon?” Hegemon Goodsong’s eyes bulged out. “But
she’s so young! She hasn’t been training for too long, has she?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Nuwa’s experiences have been extraordinary.
Supposedly, the Patriarch discovered her in the Blazesun Domain and
brought her back here,” the disciple said. “I’ve only known her
for around a hundred chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
hundred chaos cycles?” Hegemon Goodsong felt a sense of excitement.
He asked curiously, “You say that she was discovered in the
Blazesun Domain?” This was new to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
Many people know this. For her to appear there means that she
probably has an extraordinary background. She truly is a monstrously
talented figure. She became a Hegemon in just a hundred chaos cycles!
This is unbelievable even to me,” the disciple said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more Hegemon Goodsong heard, the more excited he became. This was
right, this was definitely right. The legendary Daolord Darknorth
said that Nuwa was either an incredible Daolord or had succeeded in
the Daomerge. No wonder he had spoken with such certainty! Nuwa truly
was incredible… but Daolord Darknorth was even more incredible. He
had killed the Lonely King as if the latter was just a chicken, which
meant that in the cultivator civilizations he was second only to the
Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was right. She’s the one. She’s an incredible figure, but Daolord
Darknorth is even more incredible. There’s no way this could all be
a coincidence. It has to be her!” Hegemon Goodsong mused silently,
“And she actually came from the Blazesun Domain. It seems that she
and Daolord Darknorth must know each other.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_007__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 7: First Mention of Darknorth</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
verifying that Nuwa of the Bluesky Realmverse was indeed the same
person Daolord Darknorth was seeking, Hegemon Goodsong felt both
delight and nervousness. “I need to hurry up and notify Realmslord
Windgrace of this. If I’m too slow, someone else might report it
ahead of me! Ugh… we’re incredibly far away from Realmslord
Windgrace’s territory. It won’t be easy to get this information
over to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Bluesky Realmverse was indescribably far away from Realmslord
Windgrace’s ‘Hiddenfiend Realmverse’. Even though word of Ji
Ning and his request had spread like wildfire, it had still taken
sixty million years before Hegemon Goodsong had found out and then
been the first to locate Nuwa. If he had to fly over to the
Hiddenfiend Realmverse via realmship, just passing through the
numerous special zones of the Chaosverse which lay between them would
probably take several billion years! This was probably more than
enough time for another major power to also discover Nuwa and then
notify Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace is quite famous. He rendered incredible merits during the
Dawn War and has been taught by numerous Autarchs,” Hegemon
Goodsong mused. “He’s even able to contact the legendary Autarch
Titanos. Grand Emperor Skydeep is the closest person to the Bluesky
Domain who is also able to contact Autarch Titanos. I should be able
to quickly notify Realmslord Windgrace through him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grand
Emperor Skydeep… I need to hurry up and go visit him.” Hegemon
Windgrace used his hired realmship to hurry towards Grand Emperor
Skydeep’s residence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Contacting
an Autarch was an extremely difficult task. All of them were
mysterious and hard to locate; most Hegemons were incapable of
reaching out to them. The only one who permanently resided in his own
estate was Autarch Titanos, who was the easiest one to contact.
However, even then the only ones who were able to reach out to him
were supremely powerful figures who were favored by the Autarch due
to having rendered great merits in the past! For example, even though
Ji Ning had met Autarch Titanos in person, he didn’t have any way
to reach out to the Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King was extremely strong, but he still wasn’t able to
contact Autarch Titanos. If he wished to do so, he would have to ask
other major powers to send word on his behalf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
those who had rendered truly great accomplishments in the past, such
as Realmslord Windgrace, Grand Emperor Skydeep, or God Emperor Helong
were able to reach the Autarch. But of course, even then they would
only reach out to the Autarch’s personal disciples! That was
equivalent to reaching the Autarch himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, there were very, very few people who had rendered great
enough deeds that they gained access to an Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Goodsong had to fly for over fifty million years before reaching God
Emperor Skydeep’s abode! In contrast, the Flamedragon Realmverse
was much farther away; it would’ve taken him billions of years to
reach it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, roughly 120 million years after Ning had made his Daomerge
attempt, Hegemon Goodsong managed to send word to Realmslord
Windgrace via Grand Emperor Skydeep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, roughly 90 million years after Ning’s Daomerge attempt, word
of ‘Daolord Darknoth slaying the Lonely King with one strike of the
sword’ and ‘Daolord Darknorth is searching for Nuwa’ had
already finally made its way to the Bluesky Realmverse, and thus to
Nuwa in the Blazesun Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Blazesun Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a series of explosions could be heard coming from that distant,
blazing star as countless flaming meteors continuously blasted out
from its surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
silvery-white ship was flying through the void with five figures
within it. All five had extraordinary auras, with the most
extraordinary auras belonging to an old man and a young man. The old
man had long, fiery red hair, a stooped body, and was dressed in
robes made out of fiery leaves. He had a fiery tree branch growing
out of his head as well. This was the awesome, legendary Patriarch
Treewind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the young man, he looked extraordinarily cold and remote. He was
dressed in beautiful robes, and he was known as Imperator Jade
Rainbow. He was the only person in this squad who was the equal of
Patriarch Treewind. For him to style himself as ‘Imperator’
rather than merely ‘Emperor’ was a testament to his arrogance and
self-confidence… but right now, his eyes were filled with
smoldering rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
luck has been terrible. We fought for so long and that otherverse was
almost in our grasp… but we ended up being ambushed by Palegrace
and an entire host of Hegemons. This pisses me off.” A furry alien
youth let out a low growl, his entire body crackling with fiery
power. He was a Hegemon as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
A woman was located right next to Patriarch Treewind. She was dressed
in unusual green robes which were also covered with leaves, but her
leaves were all green. Her master’s robes were covered in red
leaves. She was incredibly beautiful, and when she smiled anyone who
saw her would feel their hearts grow peaceful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we lost, we lost. We ran into that otherverse by accident anyhow,”
Nuwa said with a laugh. “Besides, an extra otherverse wouldn’t
make much of a difference to our upcoming explorations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Patriarch Treewind nodded slowly. “Although it was disappointing
and frustrating, to see an otherverse be stolen from right in front
of us, Nuwa is right. Brother Jade Rainbow and I already have
otherverses, while Nuwa has a Sithe weapon. This otherverse wouldn’t
have made too much of a difference to us. We’ve joined forces to
enter the Blazesun Domain, and our true goal is the Sithe armory Nuwa
spoke of! That otherverse was nothing more than something on the
side.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Forget
it.” The dazzlingly handsome Imperator Jade Rainbow still had a
cold look on his face as he snorted, “I’ll spare that stupid
bitch Palegrace this time. Next time I see her, I’ll teach her a
lesson. Nuwa, how far are we from the Sithe armory?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
I discovered that Sithe armory, I was still just a World-level
cultivator,” Nuwa said. “I was lucky enough to somehow survive,
but I only have a vague idea of where it was located. Based on what I
know, we should be fairly close to it now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
had appeared in the Blazesun Domain as a World-level cultivator. Back
then, she had discovered a Sithe armory but was too weak to fully
obtain it. She had barely managed to drag away a single treasure,
then had immediately fled. She had nearly died on multiple dangerous
occasions before eventually running into Patriarch Treewind, who had
taken her on as his disciple. He had led her out of the deadly
Blazesun Territory and over to the Bluesky Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
had never truly understood what the ‘Sithe armory’ she had
discovered truly represented. Only when she became a Daolord of the
Fourth Step did she understand, but she didn’t dare to make it
public. Only when she succeeded in her Daomerge and became a Hegemon
did she mention it, electing to invite a large number of Hegemons to
join forces and search for those treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Imperator Jade Rainbow suddenly revealed a look of shock as his face
actually turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong, brother Jade Rainbow?” Patriarch Treewind was rather
surprised. What could have happened, for the perpetually cold and
arrogant Imperator Jade Rainbow to lose control of his emotions like
that?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
huge just happened.” Imperator Jade Rainbow was no longer as cold
and grim as he usually was. Even his voice was rather shaky.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
huge?” Nuwa listened with curiosity. She had trained for the
shortest period of time out of the five, and she was filled with
great admiration towards Imperator Jade Rainbow, who was as strong as
her master. Without question, he was an incredible figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
man Treewind, you know the Lonely King of the Icepeak Army?” the
Imperator asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know of him.” Patriarch Treewind nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
dead.” Imperator Jade Rainbow said somberly, “He was killed by a
single sword-strike from a terrifying person known as Daolord
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Patriarch Treewind revealed a look of shock. “How is that
possible?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait,
there’s more. I don’t know the full details yet. Give me a
moment,” the Imperator said. His Primaltwin was in another
extremely distant place, and it was chatting with some other major
powers about Daolord Darknorth. Eventually, the Imperator was given
the full story… and then he heard that Daolord Darknorth was
searching for Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?!”
Imperator Jade Rainbow turned to stare at Nuwa in astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
blinked, puzzled at the look on the Imperator’s face as he stared
at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on, brother Jade Rainbow? What’s the story behind Daolord
Darknorth? The Lonely King used the Ritual Sacrificium to become a
Golden Emperor; his body was tougher than even yours, and he was
protected by multiple Sithe war machines. Most likely, the only
cultivators capable of killing him in one blow are the legendary
Autarchs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is very powerful.” Imperator Jade Rainbow stared at Nuwa
as he continued to speak: “Based on what my friends have deduced,
he has most likely managed to master the Eternal Omega Dao of the
Sword! He’s at an unfathomable level of might. The Lonely King died
before even being able to react to that single sword-strike from
him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Patriarch
Treewind was stunned upon hearing this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth?”
Nuwa had never heard this name before, but for some reason she had
the vague feeling that he was connected to her in some way. It was as
though some blurry lines of karma were linking them together. Alas,
Nuwa’s skill in the Dao of Karma simply wasn’t strong enough for
her to fully investigate every single karmic thread attached to her…
but she was still able to at least sense it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
been publicly acclaimed to be second to only the Autarchs amongst the
cultivators of the Chaosverse. He’s so powerful that he can wipe
the two of us out with just a wave of his hand.” Imperator Jade
Rainbow stared at Nuwa. “And… he’s currently looking for a
cultivator named Nuwa.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa?”
Patriarch Treewind and the other two Hegemons all turned to look.
Now, all four of them were staring at Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
said that Nuwa is an incredibly talented female cultivator who has
probably trained for roughly a hundred chaos cycles. He said that she
is either a freakishly powerful Daolord or possibly an Eternal
Emperor.” Imperator Jade Rainbow stared intently at Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
a huge coincidence.” All of them were stunned by this. As for Nuwa
herself, she didn’t say anything, but a puzzled look appeared in
her eyes.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_008__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 8: One Last Thing</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Who
was this ‘Daolord Darknorth’? She definitely didn’t know him…
but how could he possibly know that she had trained for roughly a
hundred chaos cycles? She had encountered many profound encounters;
when factoring in temporal acceleration, the actual amount of time
she had spent training was far longer than just a hundred chaos
cycles. And yet, it was true that she had only spent a hundred chaos
cycles of ‘normal’ time in training!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is incredibly talented,” Imperator Jade Rainbow
continued, “And based on what I know, he should have trained for
roughly the same length of time as you have, Nuwa! Unfortunately, he
failed his Daomerge. He must have immediately mastered the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao after failing the Daomerge. His sword-arts are
unequalled throughout the entire Chaosverse. Nuwa, he knows you and
has trained for roughly the same length of time as you. Do you know
him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
frowned slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa,”
the nearby Patriarch Treewind asked hurriedly, “Do you know Daolord
Darknorth or not?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
never heard of him. There’s no way I can be mistaken about this.
None of the old friends I used to know were named ‘Darknorth’.”
Nuwa slowly shook her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Odd.”
Patriarch Treewind was puzzled. “Is it possible that the ‘Nuwa’
he is looking for is someone else?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are countless beings with same names, but the chances are very low
that there is a second person who just so happens to be Nuwa who is
also incredibly talented and has trained for just a hundred chaos
cycles.” Imperator Jade Rainbow was puzzled as well. “Is it
possible that this really is just a crazy coincidence? Is there
really a second incredibly talented female cultivator named ‘Nuwa’
out there?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
pondered silently to herself. She had the strange feeling that the
person this ‘Daolord Darknorth’ was searching for was her, even
though they had never met before. “Daolord Darknorth… who is he?”
Nuwa mused to herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse was indescribably far away from the Blazesun
Domain. A white-robed Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position atop a
solitary mountain within Vastheaven Palace. In front of him was a
table, while the red-robed Su Youji was by his side, pouring his
wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gulped down one cup of wine after another, a hint of a smile on his
lips as he analyzed the boulders placed in front of him. Some were
jagged, some were slick, and some had plants growing next to them.
There was even a little bug that was clambering up a plant quite
slowly, even though it was furiously working its tiny little claws.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Ning watched as the beetle managed to climb atop one of the leaves.
Its weight caused the leaf to droop downwards, resulting in the
beetle falling back down to the ground again. Ning couldn’t help
but laugh when he saw this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you seem to be quite happy just watching the bugs.” Su Youji
continuously poured wine for Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled as he pointed at the bug. “Bugs need to fight for food and
mates. Their lives are short, but spectacular. Ordinary mortals might
live for a bit longer, but they generally only last a hundred years.
I seem to have been sitting here drinking some wine for quite a long
period of time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you’ve already been drinking wine here for exactly 32,822 years,”
Su Youji said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
Ning laughed. “I’m a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge. All the
Eternal Emperors sigh at how short my life will be, but I still have
thousands of chaos cycles left. I have far, far more time than those
bugs or those ordinary mortals. Hell, ordinary chaosworlds rise and
fall within the span of a single chaos cycles. If you look at it from
that perspective, I actually have a lot of time left. I wonder,
though… will I be able to last long enough to find any word of
Nuwa?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
definitely will, Master,” Su Youji said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Ning nodded. Ever since he had failed the Daomerge, he had focused
his efforts on making preparations for the people he cared about. He
had mostly finished his preparations for his disciples; the rest
would be up to them. Success or failure, life or death… it would
all be based on their own efforts. As the saying goes, the master can
show the way, but the student must walk it himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
now, Ning still worried about the Three Realms more than anything
else! This was because the Three Realms held his parents, his
daughter, his master, his fellow disciples, and many of his good
friends. It was also his homeland!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
final task I have is to find a good protector for the Three Realms.”
In the past, he had borne this burden by himself. Alas, he didn’t
have much time left. Ning was entrusting all of his hopes to Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he couldn’t find Nuwa, he was entirely capable of forcing a few
major powers to swear lifeblood oaths to protect the Three Realms!
However, someone who was doing something willingly would be far more
effective than someone who was acting out of compulsion. There was a
limit to how effective a compulsory lifeblood oath would be; the best
solution was for him to find someone who truly cared about the Three
Realms and would be willing to sacrifice for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
trusted Nuwa. She had once been the true leader of the Three Realms,
with the Three Sovereigns, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Daoist Three
Purities, and the others all serving by her side. This was a
testament to her personal charisma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning could sense a ripple manifesting outside. He turned to stare,
his gaze piercing through the dimensional walls and allowing him to
see a streak of azure light descending into the emptiness of space
outside the Vastheaven Everworld. Realmslord Windgrace had arrived
via the Blacksun!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” Realmslord Windgrace quickly arrived at Vastheaven
Palace. He descended, then walked over to face Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sit,”
Ning said calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, we’ve found Nuwa,” Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes instantly shone with utterly dazzling light. The entire world
around him seemed to have been bathed in infinite joy, and even
Realmslord Windgrace couldn’t help but be caught up by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is she?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“She’s
currently in the Blazesun Domain, but she was previously living in a
realmverse,” Realmslord Windgrace said. “That realmverse is
extremely far away from us. It’s actually fairly close to the
Quintessence of the Chaosverse! Its name is the Bluesky Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
fairly close to the Quintessence of the Chaosverse?” Ning was
rather surprised. His will was connected to the incomparably distant
prime essence of the Dao of the Sword, and thus he knew just how
incredibly far away it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace nodded. “Oh, right. Nuwa is a Hegemon of the Bluesky
Realmverse. She recently succeeded in her Daomerge and gained
Hegemony, and is the disciple of Patriarch Treewind. She’s only
trained for a hundred chaos cycles, yet has already reached Hegemony;
in terms of talent, she is probably second only to you yourself!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt even more excited upon hearing this. Nuwa had become a Hegemon
after training for just a hundred chaos cycles! This had to be her!
And she was a Hegemon? That meant she would be capable of truly
protecting the Three Realms. Weaker cultivators weren’t capable of
using the Sithe weapons Ning had acquired from the Lonely King.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
is she all the way over there?” Ning was puzzled. He immediately
asked, “Do you know anything about her?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that she first appeared in the Blazesun Domain, all by herself.
She experienced many dangers before being discovered by Patriarch
Treewind, who accepted her as his disciple. Thus, she’s technically
a foreigner and not native to the Bluesky Realmverse,” Realmslord
Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
foreigner?” Ning now felt absolutely certain it was her… and his
subconscious was whispering the same. She was Mother Nuwa of the
Three Realms!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
said she is currently in the Blazesun Domain?” Ning frowned. “Why
is she in the Blazesun Domain?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that she is accompanying Patriarch Treewind and several other
major powers in an alliance to explore its depths,” Realmslord
Windgrace said. “I heard this information from someone named
Hegemon Goodsong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. “The Blazesun Domain… that’s one of the Eight Domains
next to the place where the prime essences of the Chaosverse are
located.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
prime essences of the Chaosverse were located in a marvelous place
known as the Quintessence. You couldn’t simply find them through
normal means; not even Hegemons or Otherverse Lords were able to
locate them by simple ‘searching’. The Quintessence was the font
for all things in spacetime, and it resided in the very core of the
Chaosverse itself. Only those who were at a sufficiently high level
of enlightenment would be able to find them! Autarchs were able to
locate the Quintessence, but Hegemons were not. Ever since Ning had
taken control over the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword, he knew
that he too would be able to discover the location of the prime
essences of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
land of the prime essences… the Quintessence was a truly marvelous
place, capable of giving birth to Chaos Primordials, Sourcewalkers,
and many other living beings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Chaos
Primordials were born as gluttonous wanderers. They would slowly
drift away into the vast Chaosverse, making it quite rare for someone
to encounter one… but Sourcewalkers were different. They were
highly intelligent and thus generally preferred to stay in the
general vicinity of the prime essences! The region around the prime
essences would be naturally blessed with an incredible density of
treasures, and every so often even armories of Sithe weapons left
over from the Dawn War would appear, as well as otherverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight domains around the Quintessence with the highest concentration
of treasures were all incredibly famous. Ning had never been there
before, but he had heard of them long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, and the others have joined forces, they
should be able to keep themselves safe,” Realmslord Windgrace said.
“According to the legends, those eight domains are incredibly
dangerous to us but of no danger at all to the Autarchs. I imagine
they should be of no danger to you either, Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Ning nodded. “If Nuwa is at the Blazesun Domain, then I’ll go pay
it a visit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Domain is far too distant from us. It’ll take you several
billion years to get there by realmship,” Realmslord Windgrace
said. “Although my Blacksun is able to tear open spacetime tunnels
and allows for instantaneous transportation, there’s a limit to
what it can do. The farther the tunnel must stretch, the greater a
cost must be paid… and at a certain point, it just can’t stretch
any farther.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning smiled. “If that wasn’t the case, the Sithe
would’ve been able to spread out throughout the Chaosverse without
any limitations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
it takes a few billion years, it takes a few billion years. Doesn’t
really matter.” Ning was in a superb mood. He had found Nuwa and
had discovered that she was a Hegemon! This absolutely delighted
Ning. He now had a chance to bring a final resolution to the last
thing he was worried about.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_009__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 9: Travelling Together</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
the peak of that solitary mountain. Ji Ning and Realmslord Windgrace
remained seated facing each other, while Su Youji poured their wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Su Youji suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Ning turned to look at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to go with you on this trip to the Blazesun Domain,” Su Youji
said hurriedly. She knew that since Ning had failed the Daomerge,
there was a limit to how much longer his lifespan would be. He might
end up in a battle, resulting in his lifespan depleting even more
quickly. She wanted to accompany Ning in his final days for as long
as she could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
hesitated for a moment. He knew what Su Youji was thinking. In the
end, he nodded: “Very well. However, you need to stay with me and
listen to my orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Su
Youji immediately smiled radiantly. “Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, shall I use the Blacksun to help speed you on the first
part of your journey?” Realmslord Windgrace was rather hesitant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you poured in all the treasures you own, how far would you be able to
send me via the Blacksun?” Ning said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tearing
through space consumes an enormous amount of energy! The Hiddenfiend
Realmverse is fairly close to the Flamedragon Realmverse, which makes
things easy for me. But if I did that a few hundred times, I’d
completely use up all of my treasures,” Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was surprised: “A few hundred times? Not bad! You live up to your
reputation, Realmslord Windgrace. I didn’t realize you had that
much treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
probably don’t have as much as you, Daolord Darknorth,”
Realmslord Windgrace said with a laugh. “The Lonely King plundered
his way through the Chaosverse. He had many foes, but he also had
many more treasures than I do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
admitted to it. The Lonely King had an entire army pillaging on his
behalf, and had killed three Otherverse Lords. He had also acquired a
complete Sithe armory… and now, all of it belonged to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
other words, even if you used up all your treasures on the Blacksun,
it’d only save me less than a hundred million years of flight time
via realmship.” Ning shook his head. “This trip to the Blazesun
Domain will take billions of years. Saving a bit of time won’t be
of much use.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
lifespan was limited, but it was still calculated in chaos cycles.
‘Short’ was relative to the lifespans of Eternal Emperors and
Daolords!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Daolord Darknorth,” Realmslord Windgrace said gratefully. He
couldn’t help but feel rather nervous before Ning, who was capable
of killing him with ease. He previously had designs on Ning’s
Flamewing God, after all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
next day, Ning led Flamewing, Hegemon Azurefiend, Protector
Whitethaw, and Su Youji in boarding his realmship and departing from
the Flamedragon Realmverse. They were heading off to the distant
Blazesun Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the endless Great Dark. Hegemon Azurefiend was helping to steer the
realmship. There were two ways to ensure that a realmship could
continue to proceed at incredible speeds. The first was to use chaos
jewels to replenish it’s power; the second was to have a Hegemonic
figure use his Immortal energy to keep it activated! This journey
would last billions of years, and they’d be travelling every day.
It would be quite hard to come up with enough chaos jewels to meet
the consumption need.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons,
however, could constantly replenish their Immortal ki and were
completely capable of restoring it at a rate which surpassed what the
realmship used up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
goodness we have Azurefiend.” Ning stood there, staring into the
endless Great Dark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.”
Azurefiend squeezed an exaggerated smile onto his withered, gnarly
old face. “It is my honor and my blessing to be able to serve the
almighty Daolord Darknorth. Other Hegemons would beg for this
opportunity on their knees, to no avail. O, almighty Daolord
Darknorth, if you were willing to give me just a few pointers, I
would benefit endlessly from your wisdom.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Knock
it off,” Ning said with a light groan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh heh,” Azurefiend snickered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
smile looks ugly as all hell,” Flamewing said, casting a sidelong
glance at Azurefiend while eating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend’s
old face tightened as he pointed at Flamewing: “You glutton, it’s
none of your business if I wish to flatter my master!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that?” Flamewing glared at him. “Azurefiend, you wanna go outside
the ship and have a little sparring competition?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
just kidding with you!” Azurefiend immediately shifted tacts and
smiled ingratiatingly at Flamewing. By now, everyone had known each
other for quite some time. At the beginning, Azurefiend would never
have dared to jest with Flamewing like this. By now, they were just
teasing each other. Everyone understood everyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Su
Youji smiled as she watched from nearby. As for Whitethaw, he stood
by Ning’s side with that honest look on his face as always.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough.
I’ll give you some guidance on our way over. Focus on controlling
the realmship,” Ning said. His mastery over the Eternal Omega Sword
Dao had allowed him to reach a brand new level. All other Daos
instantly seemed so much simpler to Ning! Ning’s insights into the
other Daos were continually increasing. He didn’t have to train
like crazy; all he had to do was spend the occasional period of time
in meditation, and he would begin to skyrocket in his understanding
of those Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Autarch Bolin, as a Hegemon, had to spend an
extremely long period of time before managing to upgrade all those
other Daos to the Hegemonic level. Ning was now far more powerful
than Autarch Bolin had been as a Hegemon, and it could be said that
there was now only a small difference in insight between himself and
the Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs were born off the principle of ‘One Dao Births Many Daos’.
Ning, in contrast, was a pure ruler of the Dao of the Sword. In terms
of the Sword Dao, he was the absolute number one expert in all the
Chaosverse. Given enough time, it wouldn’t be too hard for him to
reach Hegemony in the Dao of Water, the Dao of Lightning, the Dao of
Formations, and his other Daos. Alas, there was a limit to how long
he would be alive for and thus there was no way he could study the
other Daos as he pleased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Master,” Azurefiend chortled. By now, he also addressed Ning
as ‘Master’, and even he didn’t notice the change. Ning was
simply so powerful that Azurefiend no longer felt the slightest bit
of pride when facing Ning. All he felt was a sense of submission. By
now, there were probably many Hegemons who would be willing to serve
him. A casual bit of tutelage from Ning would represent an enormous
karmic blessing for those Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. More than 3.9 billion years went past in the blink of an
eye. Ning had acquired a detailed star map from the treasures he had
taken from the deceased Lonely King, and he had also gotten another
star map from Realmslord Windgrace. Although it was impossible for
anyone to fully map out the entire Chaosverse, he now had fairly
complete records on most of the places cultivators had visited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
this journey, Ning had continuously used the Dao of Numerancy to
divine the most appropriate paths forward, as well as the safest
route through some places with distorted spacetime. This allowed them
to easily pass through even the most dangerous of environments.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!
Master!” Azurefiend said hurriedly, “The Squaremix Realmverse is
up ahead. That’s the place Hegemon Goodsong asked to meet with us.
He should be in the ‘Grand Void Canyon’ of the Squaremix
Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Goodsong?” Ning nodded slowly. “He informed me of Nuwa’s
location. I owe him a debt and should go repay it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
I’m sure he wouldn’t dare to ask for too much,” Azurefiend said
with a cold snort.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he does, I’ll eat him!” Flamewing called out, his mouth covered
with grease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough,
you two. Pipe down,” Ning said. “Let’s go meet Hegemon
Goodsong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Just a short while later, the realmship arrived in the ‘Grand Void
Canyon’ of the Squaremix Realmverse. This was a very unique place
with distorted spacetime that came together in layers, forming an
enormous spatial canyon that could be seen with the naked eye. The
depths of the canyon led to another mysterious realm that was filled
with tremendous danger. This was a place that had been created during
the Dawn War, and the depths of the canyon were filled with many
relics. However, by now Ning didn’t care about such relics or
legacies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
they come.” A bald, red-robed man was standing directly above the
Grand Void Canyon, scanning the area anxiously. Moments later, a
spacetime rift appeared and a realmship came sailing out of it. The
red-robed man was overjoyed and immediately flew over to welcome
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Several
figures came flying out of the realmship. The leader was a
white-robed youth who had a black sheath on his back. Others could
dimly sense that his truesoul was slowly but surely fragmenting
apart, generating unique ripples as the fragments disappeared into
the void. Next to him was the furry Sithe Protector Whitethaw, as
well as a peerlessly beautiful woman. There was also a skinny,
shriveled old man and a fatty who was holding onto a haunch of meat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fatty was Flamewing. It was a born glutton who was capable of
devouring entire realmverses with ease. It truly did have a
terrifying appetite… and it suddenly glanced sideways at the bald,
red-robed man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eek!”
The red-robed man instantly quivered as his subconscious screamed to
him that he was in terrible danger. He knew that the fat man was the
legendary Chaos Primordial which Daolord Darknorth had tamed, a
creature which could kill Hegemons like him with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Hegemon Goodsong also knew that the most terrifying member of this
team wasn’t the Chaos Primordial. Rather, it was the
harmless-looking white-robed youth standing in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goodsong
greets you, Daolord Darknorth.” Hegemon Goodsong bowed
respectfully, not daring to show the slightest bit of disrespect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to thank you, Hegemon Goodsong. Thanks to you, I finally know
where Nuwa is. If I didn’t find her, I would probably harbor
regrets until the day of my death.” Ning smiled. “I promised long
ago that I would owe a favor to the first person to help me locate
her. What do you wish of me, Hegemon Goodsong? I’ll do anything I’m
capable of doing.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_010__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 10: Request</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Goodsong instantly began to grow nervous. The moment of truth had
come! He had spared no expense and even hired a realmship, all for
the sake of this favor! If Daolord Darknorth hadn’t been willing to
offer anything at all, it wouldn’t matter how strong he was; no one
would’ve been willing to work so hard for him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Hegemon Goodsong couldn’t help but feel nervous. He was worried
that his request would be too excessive and anger Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, a favor was just that; a favor. If Hegemon Goodsong asked Ji
Ning to do something that would result in Ning’s truesoul crumbling
even faster, Ning would probably refuse immediately. Thus, there was
a limit to what he could ask for. Hegemon Goodsong himself was rather
nervous, but he had long ago decided on what he needed. He felt
certain that Daolord Darknorth wouldn’t attack him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth,” Hegemon Goodsong said respectfully, “I reached the
level of Hegemony long ago, longer than even I can remember. I have
many friends, and a good number have become Otherverse Lords! But I
remain a mere Hegemon, unable to improve in power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to listen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
as you know, we are quite close to the Eight Domains. Although
Hegemons are quite powerful, there are also many people here who are
stronger than Hegemons,” Hegemon Goodsong said sadly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had to agree. This was a place that was completely unlike the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance he resided in. The Eight Domains… they were
closer to the prime essences of the realmverse than any other place.
Aside from the prime essences themselves, which were almost
impossible to find, the Eight Domains represented the most central
region of the entire Chaosverse! It was filled with countless
treasures and experts, which was why the major powers of neighboring
realmverses would often go exploring and adventuring within them.
Many major powers had died in the Eight Domains, but some would
successfully acquire the treasures they sought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
so often, an otherverse would appear within the Eight Domains, as
would Sithe weapons and other things. Even Nuwa, who had merely been
at the World level, had somehow reached the Blazesun Domain from the
Three Realms, then stumbled across a Sithe weapon there. The Blazesun
Domain was one of the Eight Domains, and it truly was a special
place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
comparison, the Flamedragon Realmverse was extremely far away from
the prime essences. It could be viewed as something of a peripheral
backwater, a place where very few Otherverse Lords resided. It was
simply too far away from the core!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what are you asking for exactly?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Goodsong gritted his teeth. “Daolord, I wish to increase my power
to the Otherverse Lord level!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
You actually dared to make a request like this?” The nearby Hegemon
Azurefiend let out a cold snicker. “Generally speaking, there are
three ways in which one can reach the Otherverse Lord level of power
via external methods. The first is to take control of an otherverse!
However, the appearance of every single otherverse will result in a
frenzied struggle and competition that is far more cruel than you can
imagine. The second is to obtain a ‘Golden Emperor form’ and to
use it via the Ritual Sacrificium to become a Golden Emperor… but
do you know how rare and valuable those things are? Even the Lonely
King chose to transform himself into a Golden Emperor. Who the hell
are you and why do you think you deserve one?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
final method is to acquire extremely powerful Sithe weapons that can
let you unleash the power of an Otherverse Lord. Some Sithe weapons
are strong, some are weak. A Sithe weapon that will increase your
power to the Otherverse Lord level is probably going to be just as
valuable as a Golden Emperor form!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned as well. Could he accomplish this? He could! The Lonely King
had a total of six extremely powerful Sithe weapons, but he himself
normally only used three of them. The most valuable of the six was
the silver throne, which could create illusory dopplegangers and
allow one to flee by warping through spacetime. It could also build
up power to unleash an attack that was so terrifying it could destroy
an entire otherverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other Sithe weapons were a bit weaker, but they were still enough to
raise a Hegemon to the Otherverse Lord level of power… but Ning was
planning to give them to Nuwa and the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
a cultivator. My only goal is to increase my personal power as much
as I can. Aside from this, there truly is nothing else that I need.”
Hegemon Goodsong looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was silent for a long moment, then said: “Otherverses are blessings
that can only be hoped for, not counted on. I can’t just find one
for you! Sithe weapons… although I have some, I already have plans
for them. As for Golden Emperor forms, I don’t have any.” The
Lonely King had long ago used up all of the Golden Emperor forms he
had acquired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, you might not have one… but someone nearby known as
Divine Sovereign Goldsun does,” Hegemon Goodsong suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Divine
Sovereign Goldsun?” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you asking my master to go and get it from him?” Azurefiend stared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
Daolord Darknorth went to ask for a Golden Emperor form, I imagine
Divine Sovereign Goldsun wouldn’t dare to decline,” Hegemon
Goodsong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to ponder on this. Although the star map which Realmslord
Windgrace had provided Ning was fairly incomplete, it did record
information about the supreme powers of various regions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance was something of a backwater, but the
area around the Eight Domains could be considered part of the core of
the Chaosverse. Experts were incredibly common here, and the people
who were able to become local rulers were all extraordinary. Divine
Sovereign Goldsun was someone who was unquestionably as powerful as
the Lonely King. If the Lonely King could be described as a madman,
then Divine Sovereign Goldsun was like an emperor who had unified
this entire region under his rule.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Divine
Sovereign Goldsun controlled a total of eight nearby realmverses. He
himself was an Otherverse Lord, and he also had acquired Sithe
armories in the past! He had once bestowed two Golden Emperor forms
to his subordinate Hegemons, and had promised that anyone who had
rendered great merits would be given one as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are quite daring,” Ning said. “But aren’t you afraid that
Divine Sovereign Goldsun would come for you later?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.”
A frenzied look appeared in Hegemon Goodsong’s eyes. “Once I
become a Golden Emperor, it’ll be very hard for anyone to kill me.
I have no kith or kin who can be used against me, and I’ll be far
more powerful than I was in the past. What do I have to fear?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning nodded. “I owe you a favor. I’ll go pay Divine
Sovereign Goldsun a visit.” As Ning saw it, visiting the Divine
Sovereign might end up being a good thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me lead the way!” Hegemon Goodsong was delighted. It was incredibly
difficult for a Hegemon to increase another level in power. For the
sake of becoming more powerful, many Hegemons would be willing to
risk their lives. Alas, very few would have a chance like this.
Hegemon Goodsong had successfully grasped his!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took them more than five million years to fly from the Squaremix
Realmverse to the Goldsun Realmverse, the central region of Divine
Sovereign Goldsun’s rule.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Before them was an enormous flaming star that was emanating endless
amounts of heat and light. The surface of this fiery star was
actually covered with many beautiful palaces. This was the Goldsun
Palace of Divine Sovereign Goldsun, and there were more than ten
Hegemons who resided here! There were also two Golden Emperors and
sixteen Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
flaming star is actually a marvelous Sithe weapon as well,” the
white-robed Ning evaluated as he stared at the star. They had used
the realmship to warp through spacetime and come to this place. “The
formations covering this entire cluster of palaces is quite abstruse
and profound. It won’t be easy to attack this place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
it would be nothing for you, Daolord Darknorth,” Hegemon Goodsong
flattered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let us go meet with Divine Sovereign Goldsun. I’m quite curious
about him.” Ning had a rather favorable impression of Divine
Sovereign Goldsun, as the man was truly committed to the Dao. He
clearly had access to Golden Emperor forms, but he didn’t undergo
the Ritual Sacrificium; from this, one could see that he was still
committed to attempting to become an Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning immediately flew out towards the surface of the fiery star with
Su Youji, Whitethaw, and the others by his side. Right as they
landed…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”
A loud shout rang out, followed by an onyx humanoid flying over in a
fierce manner. When he saw Ning’s group, he barked, “This place
is the Goldsun Palace. Trespass is not permitted!” As a guard of
the Goldsun Palace, he had long ago grown accustomed to behaving
arrogantly in carrying out his duties.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Flamewing let out a cold snort. Its aura flared malevolently, causing
the guard to instantly feel a terrifying sense of danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Send
word to Divine Sovereign Goldsun. Tell him that Daolord Darknorth has
come to visit him.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has come to visit him?” The guard stared blankly for a
moment. In the next moment, his face turned completely ashen. When he
thought of the many rumors swirling around this man, his voice began
to quiver as he said respectfully, “Please wait a moment, Daolord
Darknorth. I’ll go send word right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, and the guard instantly flew off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
why are you so courteous to him? Just fly right on in. I’d like to
see what Divine Sovereign Goldsun would do about it!” Hegemon
Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
already have an overwhelming advantage in power. There’s no need to
use it to bully others.” Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Goldsun Palace. Divine Sovereign Goldsun was being waited upon by
two female attendants. He held a jade slip in his hands and was
viewing and meditating upon it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Divine
Sovereign! Divine Sovereign!” A frantic cry came from outside as
the Black Emperor guard came rushing into the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hrm?”
A hint of annoyance could be seen in Divine Sovereign Goldsun’s
eyes as he glanced at the guard. The Divine Sovereign was someone who
cared tremendously about propriety and status. He naturally felt
rather irritated that this guard actually dared to barge into his
private meditation room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Divine
Sovereign, Daolord Darknorth has arrived!” the guard called out
frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Divine
Sovereign Goldsun snapped, “And so what if Daolord Da-… eh? Did
you say Daolord Darknorth?” His face instantly turned ashen, and
his heart began to quiver. He naturally didn’t feel the slightest
bit of pride or arrogance when faced with someone who could slay him
with ease. In fact, he felt a hint of terror. Why had Daolord
Darknorth suddenly come to visit him without any preamble? Could it
be that Daolord Darknorth had come to kill him and take his
treasures?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is he?” Divine Sovereign Goldsun could feel that his heart was
shaking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
right outside the palace gates,” the guard said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_011__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 11: Houwu City</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
WHAT? You actually had Daolord Darknorth wait outside the palace
gates?” Divine Sovereign Goldsun instantly cast the guard a furious
glare as he hurriedly rose to his feet. Swoosh! He instantly
disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning, Su Youji, Whitethaw, the Flamewing God, Azurefiend, and Hegemon
Goodsong were all waiting outside the gates to the Goldsun Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
A figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It was the beautifully
dressed Divine Sovereign Goldsun. His face was now covered with
smiles. As soon as he saw Ning, he could immediately sense that this
Daolord whose truesoul was slowly splintering apart had to be the
legendary Daolord Darknorth! This was because Divine Sovereign
Goldsun could sense that unique aura emanating from this white-robed
youth, an aura that was profounder than profound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
aura actually had a whiff of the prime essence of the Dao of the
Sword itself. Ning wasn’t trying to hide his aura, but even so
ordinary Hegemons would not be capable of detecting it. Divine
Sovereign Goldsun was focused on becoming an Autarch and had trained
for many years. He had reached an extremely high level of power and
had gained tremendous insight into many different Daos. As a result,
his senses were even more acute than the likes of God Emperor Helong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goldsun
greets you, Daolord Darknorth.” Divine Sovereign Goldsun instantly
bowed respectfully, then said with a smile, “I never would’ve
imagined that you’d come to visit me. I’m absolutely overwhelmed
and delighted.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
come here because there’s something I need to trouble you about,
Divine Sovereign,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
come in first. We can discuss it shortly,” Divine Sovereign Goldsun
said hurriedly. “If there’s anything I can help you out with,
I’ll do everything I can. Daolord Darknorth, please come in.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
followed him inside. Su Youji and Whitethaw followed from behind,
with Flamewing, Azurefiend, and Hegemon Goodsong bringing up the
rear. Hegemon Goodsong felt particularly delighted, while Flamewing
gave Divine Sovereign Goldsun a provocative stare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a savage, bloodthirsty aura! It is probably just as strong as I am.
This should be that legendary Chaos Primordial.” Divine Sovereign
Goldsun glanced at Flamewing as well, but continued to warmly guide
Ning deeper into his estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had long ago ordered for his subordinates to prepare a banquet. A
feast had been laid out at the main hall of the Goldsun Palace, with
many servants and maids all waiting to serve them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Goldsun sat down in the lotus position in the highest seats.
Divine Sovereign Goldsun intentionally set his table slightly lower
than Ning’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
heard of your illustrious name long ago, Daolord Darknorth. I’ve
always admired you, but I live too far away from the Flamedragon
Realmverse. I’ve regretted being unable to visit you, but today
you’ve overwhelmed me with delight by coming to visit my Goldsun
Palace instead.” Divine Sovereign Goldsun smiled. “Come, come!
Let us share a few toasts first. I wish to celebrate your visit to my
palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other major powers of Goldsun Palace all raised their cups in unison
as well. Ning smiled and lifted his own cup, downing it on the spot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
Fine wine,” Ning couldn’t help but speak out in praise. When he
drank the wine, he felt as though a ball of fire was going all the
way down his throat into his belly. The tremendous heat instantly
filled his entire body to the point where he felt it was going to
burst out of his skin. Moments later, a cool and refreshing feeling
spread out from his stomach and encompassed his entire body. This
alternating process of heat and cool resulted in him feeling as
though his body had just undergone a baptism of sorts, almost as
though it had been transformed and remade.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a special product of the Goldsun Palace, the ‘Triflame Jewel
Brew’. I have quite a bit of it stockpiled away in my palace. If
you like it, Daolord, you can take some with you and enjoy it in the
future as well,” Divine Sovereign Goldsun said with a laugh. He
knew very well that he had to be extremely careful when dealing with
someone like Daolord Darknorth, who now stood at the very apex of
power in the cultivator civilizations… and who had failed his
Daomerge! The slightest bit of discourtesy could result in
irreversible repercussions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled and said, “Then I’ll accept some. Divine Sovereign
Goldsun, I’ve come because there is something I need to bother you
about.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Pray
tell, Daolord,” Divine Sovereign Goldsun said hurriedly. The entire
room turned silent, with Hegemon Goodsong listening the most
attentively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, causing a storage bracelet to appear. He handed it
over and said, “I wish to use some of the treasures within this
estate-world to trade for a Golden Emperor form from you, Divine
Ruler.” Ning had quite a few treasures by now. He had looted the
Jadefire Realm clean and had stripped the Lonely King of all his
treasures. Ning had left behind the ones he thought would be of great
use to the Three Realms, then chose some other rare materials that
were of limited use to him right now. There were around ten or so
which, all combined, were more or less equal in value to a Golden
Emperor form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that it? A Golden Emperor form? Daolord, for you to visit me in
person and show such courtesy shows that you hold me in esteem. How
could I possibly be so stingy as to hold back a Golden Emperor form
from you?” Divine Sovereign Goldsun waved his hand as he spoke,
causing a head-sized ball of golden liquid to immediately fly out.
This golden liquid was shaped like a perfect globe, and it was
covered by a layer of continuously flowing light. It seemed quite
mysterious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
for your treasures, Daolord, I don’t need them.” Divine Sovereign
Goldsun said hurriedly, “This Golden Emperor form is my gift to
you, Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was able to bestow these things to even his subordinates. To him, a
Golden Emperor form actually wasn’t all that valuable. He cared far
more about the Sithe weapons he used to keep himself safe. He
actually felt relieved that Daolord Darknorth had merely asked for a
Golden Emperor form; the loss wouldn’t have any impact on his own
personal power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand to accept the golden globe of liquid, then smiled: “Go
ahead and take it.” The storage bracelet continued to hover in
front of Divine Sovereign Goldsun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Umm…”
Divine Sovereign Goldsun hesitated for a moment, then said, “Daolord
Darknorth, there really isn’t any need for you to give me the
treasures inside this bracelet. I have cultivated for many years and
have many treasures; a few more really won’t make any difference to
me. But… Daolord Darknorth, would you be willing to perhaps give me
some guidance?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao was not to be casually transmitted to others. Divine Sovereign
Goldsun didn’t dare to ask Ning to actually transmit the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao to him; all he asked for was some guidance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Very well. I’ll give you three days worth of guidance in
order to repay you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a vast hallway, Divine Sovereign Goldsun manifested a pair of wings
and wielded a semi-translucent saber in each of his two hands. The
sabers were as thin as the wings of a cicada.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood off in the distance, facing him. A single streak of sword-light
manifested in the air between them. This sword-light was generated
from the external manifestation of the aura of the prime essence of
the Dao of the Sword. Unless absolutely necessary, Ning wouldn’t
use any of his own divine power or Immortal energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Swish! Swish! Sword-light danced in a ghostly, dream-like manner,
almost like moonlight playing across the darkness. Divine Sovereign
Goldsun fought with tremendous savagery and in an extraordinarily
dominating style, but faced with Ning’s sword-arts his stances
became filled with countless flaws. Each time, Ning was able to break
apart his attacks with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The sword-light came to a halt right in front of Divine Sovereign
Goldsun’s forehead, causing him to awkwardly halt his attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
lost again.” Divine Sovereign Goldsun shook his head and sighed. “I
always thought that my saber-arts were impressive. I’ve never
suffered such catastrophic losses after becoming a Hegemon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been completely outclassed in a battle of technique! Autarchs
could do this as well, but Autarchs couldn’t be bothered to guide
him. Generally speaking, they would only provide a bit of guidance to
figures who they liked AND who had rendered great merits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, there were countless Hegemons who deeply desired to be given a
bit of guidance by the peerless Daolord who had mastered the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao, but this required luck and karma. Divine Sovereign
Goldsun had decisively rejected any treasures and instead asked for
guidance from Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
past three days have been more helpful to me than the past ten
million chaos cycles of solitary training. I now realize that my
saber-arts are actually flawed in many ways.” Divine Sovereign
Goldsun said gratefully, “Thank you, Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
the three days have come to an end, it is time for me to leave,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending three days with Ning, Divine Sovereign Goldsun no longer
felt as much fear as he had in the past. He now had the feeling that
Ning was quite easy-going. He said warmly, “Daolord Darknorth…
dare I ask, have you come here from the distant Flamedragon
Realmverse because you are searching for Nuwa?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning didn’t deny it. Word of his search for Nuwa had long ago
spread to countless places.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you wish to find Nuwa, I should be able to help out a bit,” Divine
Sovereign Goldsun said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can help out?” Ning was surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, you are probably aware that Nuwa is currently accompanying
her master, Patriarch Treewind, and other major powers in a journey
through the Blazesun Domain,” Divine Sovereign Goldsun said. “But…
you probably don’t know that Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, and the
others are currently within the city of Houwu in the Blazesun
Domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes lit up when he heard this. The city of Houwu? The Blazesun
Domain was enormous; it would actually be quite tricky to locate Nuwa
within it. He had been planning to first locate Nuwa and Patriarch
Treewind’s avatars, then find them in person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I have a bit of a reputation in the area around the Blazesun Domain,”
Divine Sovereign Goldsun said with a laugh. “I’m kept quite up to
date with news in this area, and I’m good friends with Lord Houwu.
All I need to do is send word to Lord Houwu and ask him to inform
Patriarch Treewind and Nuwa and have them wait for you in Houwu City!
That way, you can just meet them there and save yourself some
trouble.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_012__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 12: Blazesun Domain</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are currently at Houwu City?” Ji Ning was delighted. This really
would make things much simpler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
received this information just a short while ago. Usually,
cultivators will spend an extended period of time resting at Houwu
City once they reach it. Let me reach out to Lord Houwu once more.”
Divine Sovereign Goldsun immediately sent out his godsense to contact
with one of his subordinates: “Help me immediately contact Lord
Houwu and ask if Nuwa and Patriarch Treewind are still at Houwu City.
If they are there, I would like to ask Lord Houwu to keep them here!
Tell them that Daolord Darknorth will be arriving in around twenty
million years and wishes to meet Nuwa.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Divine Sovereign.” This Hegemon servant of his had a Primaltwin in
the distant city of Houwu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Houwu
City. Within the Blazesun Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Houwu
City was an enormous levitating city that saw several estates
sprinkled throughout the city. Very few cultivators came here;
generally speaking, only Eternal Emperors would ever dare to come
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Loud laughter rang out, followed by a green-robed elder and two
retainers flying into the skies above an estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Treewind! Brother Jade Rainbow!” the green-robed elder called out
loudly, his voice shaking the entire estate. Soon, a total of five
figures came flying out from within the estate, including Patriarch
Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Governor, why have you come to our residence? If there’s anything
you need from us, all you needed to do was send word.” Patriarch
Treewind and the others were all quite courteous, and they hurriedly
moved to welcome their guest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
green-robed elder chortled as he turned his gaze towards Nuwa: “I
come on important business, after all. This must be Nuwa?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
said, “Nuwa greets you, Lord Governor.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
truly impressive. You were able to complete the Daomerge and reach
Hegemony in just a hundred chaos cycles,” the green-robed elder
praised. “No wonder Daolord Darknorth has come to seek you out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
praise me too much. I made use of temporal acceleration treasures
when I trained. My actual amount of time spent cultivating was far
more than a hundred chaos cycles,” Nuwa said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
The green-robed elder said, “I’ve come to help Daolord Darknorth
send you a message.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Help
Daolord Darknorth send a message?” Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, and
Imperator Jade Rainbow were all stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has sent word to me via Divine Sovereign Goldsun. He hopes
that you will remain at Houwu City, because he’ll be arriving soon.
Daolord Darknorth shall be descending upon Houwu City in person in
twenty million years to meet with you, Nuwa.” The green-robed elder
looked at Nuwa and smiled. “Nuwa, congratulations. Countless
Hegemons and Emperors desperately desire to have a chance to meet
with Daolord Darknorth, but never will. For you, however, Daolord
Darknorth has flown all the way here from the incredibly distant
Flamedragon Realmverse. It seems that he views you as being
incredibly important! Haha, even I can’t help but envy you, Nuwa.
If I need to ask for your help in the future, I hope you won’t
refuse me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
do everything in my power to assist you.” Nuwa was rather puzzled.
“I’m embarrassed to admit this, but… I don’t believe Daolord
Darknorth and I know each other.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
if you don’t know each other, why would he go to such great lengths
to meet with you? I imagine you’ll know who he is once he actually
arrives.” The green-robed elder continued, “Alright, I’ve
already conveyed his message. Just wait for him here in Houwu City;
you’ll only need to pause for a few tens of millions of years!
Also… please don’t make things difficult for me. Since Daolord
Darknorth asked for me to keep you here, I wouldn’t dare to let you
leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. We’ll wait at Houwu City for Daolord Darknorth,” Imperator
Jade Rainbow said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good!”
Lord Houwu smiled and nodded. “I’m off, then.” Patriarch
Treeind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and Nuwa all watched as Lord Houwu
left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems we have to stay here for a time,” Patriarch Treewind said
with a chuckle. “If we tried to leave, Lord Houwu would probably
trap us here by force.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Imperator Jade Rainbow smiled coldly. “Lord Houwu has always been
an arrogant and overbearing bully. He only spoke to us with courtesy
for the sake of Daolord Darknorth. He wouldn’t dare to refuse to
convey Daolord Darknorth’s message.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
were planning to hide in Houwu City for a time anyhow,” Patriarch
Treewind said. “Let’s make use of this opportunity to meet with
the legendary Daolord Darknorth. Nuwa, when that happens I might need
to ask you to say a few words on my behalf.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
said self-deprecatingly, “I still have no clue who this Daolord
Darknorth really is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be impatient. A mere twenty million years will go by like nothing.
You’ll know soon enough,” Imperator Jade Rainbow said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Ning’s team left the Goldsun Palace and began to advance
through the endless Great Dark. After a total of over twenty million
years, they finally reached the Blazesun Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooosh.
Endless flames were flying through this entire region, as were
blazing rocks. In front of them was an incredibly vast and dazzling
realmverse which was filled with planets and stars that all looked
like giant balls of fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Eight Domains.” Hegemon Goodsong was dressed in red robes, and his
entire body gleamed like gold. He smiled and immediately began to
introduce the place: “In the vast Chaosverse, there are many sacred
places which are formed by the convergence of certain types of
energy! This place is the closest region to the Quintessence of the
Chaosverse, and it is divided into eight incredibly marvelous
domains. The Blazesun Domain is filled with the power of countless
flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded while the nearby Azurefiend said, “The ‘Icewind Sea’ we
visited in the past was a place which was formed from a convergence
of freezing energy that was roughly comparable to a territory in
size! The Blazesun Domain, however, is unfathomably vaster in size
and scope than the Icewind Sea. It is one of the Eight Domains, the
most supreme of sacred lands, and it is comparable in size to more
than half of a realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Icewind Sea was an ‘ordinary’ sacred land, while the Eight
Domains were the most supreme sacred lands of the entire Chaosverse.
All sorts of unique living beings had gathered here, including
Sourcewalkers, the occasional Chaos Primordials, and more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,”
Hegemon Goodsong said warmly, “There are two ways for us to travel
into Houwu City. The first way is fairly safe; it involves us
avoiding many dangerous locations, and it’ll take us tens of
millions of years to get there. The other method is to just blaze our
way straight through. We might run into quite a great deal of danger
in doing so, but we’ll only need five hundred thousand years or
so.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
go straight through,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right
on!” Hegemon Goodsong continued hurriedly, “We might encounter
some danger when going straight through, but I should be able to
resolve any dangers myself. If we encounter something really serious,
we can then have the Flamewing God intervene as well. There should be
no need for you to personally intervene, Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. Goodsong was now a Golden Emperor; between him and the
Flamewing God, the vast majority of dangers could be easily resolved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship flew straight into the Blazesun Domain, charging
towards Houwu City at maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Domain was a place where an incredibly vast amount of
flaming energy congregated. Its vast size actually gave it superior
stability, resulting in it being a world unto itself. It was filled
with fire, but there are also places with earth, water, stone, and
more. There were many empty pockets of space where the temperature
was a bit higher than in ‘normal’ realmverses, but Celestial
Immortals and Empyrean Gods would still be able to survive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more stable a region was, the more hospitable for life it would
generally be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, the Blazesun Domain also had some incredibly dangerous
places within it, places which were far deadlier than the Icewind
Sea. The Icewind Sea merely had two Sourcewalkers in it; the Blazesun
Domain had far more! However, they were scattered throughout the
entire domain, making chances of running into them quite low.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A dark-red river could be seen surging through the emptiness of
space, stretching off into infinity. This dark-red river had to be
many millions of kilometers long, and it emanated an aura of endless
heat. Every so often, a few serpentine beings could be seen swimming
through the river.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaaar!”
A long black serpent lifted its head and half of its enormous body
above the surface of the river, focusing its flaming gaze on Ning’s
realmship, which was advancing through the region at high speeds. Its
eyes were filled with malevolence, and it raised its serpentine head
high as it let out an earth-shaking roar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
roar actually generated a ripple of power that caused space around it
to twist and distort. Instantly, additional giant blackflame serpents
lifted their heads up as well. Cultivators were actually trespassing
here? They were courting death!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
environment here was extremely inhospitable to ordinary life. There
was no way to warp through spacetime here, and so Ning’s group had
to physically fly through this region. If they wanted to avoid it,
they would have to take a detour that would last millions of years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Blackflame
River has dozens of these giant blackflame serpents living within it.
All of them are unique creatures born from the Quintessence of the
Chaosverse, but only three of them have reached the Otherverse Lord
level of power. Most of the others are Hegemons; they are of little
danger,” Hegemon Goodsong immediately explained. “Once Flamewing
appears, they’ll be so terrified that they won’t dare to move.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Ning said, “Flamewing, go out with Goodsong and give these little
black snakes a good scare.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh heh… they look delicious, actually.” Flamewing immediately
flew out of the realmship, letting out an excited howl as it
transformed into its true form. Bathed in flames, the Flamewing God
flapped its giant wings and immediately swooped down towards the
nearest blackflame serpent. Clearly, Flamewing enjoyed being in the
fiery environment of the Blazesun Domain. Being here excited it, and
as a result it moved with such incredible speeds that the giant
blackflame serpent was terrified. Its malevolent aura vanished and it
immediately moved to flee… but how could it possibly escape?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_013__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 13: They Finally Meet</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crunch!
The Flamewing God’s giant maw came crunching down upon the
blackflame serpent. As Flamewing began to chew, the blackflame
serpent’s writhing body suddenly began to erupt with flames. Soon,
it became burnt to ash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sight completely terrified the other blackflame serpents in the
flaming river.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordial, hurry up and leave our territory!” an exceptionally
large blackflame serpent roared furiously, but it didn’t step
forward. It knew that perhaps the only members of the race who would
survive a fight against Flamewing would be him and the other two
leaders. The others were completely incapable of battling against a
Chaos Primordial. If an actual battle erupted, they would simply be
throwing their lives away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grrr…”
Flamewing let out a loud and smug growl.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive.
If I tried to go up by myself, I’d definitely be surrounded by
them,” Hegemon Goodsong said enviously. Flamewing had a virtually
indestructible body and possessed incredible speed; surrounding it
was useless. Most likely, only Sithe Exalts would be able to
effectively surround and threaten it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
leave.” Seeing this, Ning knew that the blackflame serpents would
no longer try to bar their path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
Hegemon Goodsong and the Flamewing God clearing a path for them,
their journey was simple and uneventful. Ning didn’t need to
intervene a single time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
did encounter several unique and bizarre types of lifeforms, all of
whom were birthed from within the Quintessence of the Chaosverse! The
most powerful creatures birthed from the prime essences were the
Chaos Primordials and the Sourcewalkers, but both were incredibly
rare. Chaos Primordials were born with immense power, while
Sourcewalkers were a bit weaker but had incredible powers of insight
and thus had more room to grow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other creatures born from the prime essences were blessed with far
less power than the Chaos Primordials and far weaker levels of
insight than the Sourcewalkers. They were much more numerous, but on
the whole the Sourcewalkers remained the most powerful creatures
birthed from the prime essences! This was because the most powerful
Sourcewalkers were actually comparable to Sithe Exalts in terms of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, the Blazesun Domain had one of these supreme Sourcewalkers
within it who was comparable to Sithe Exalts in power! But of course,
he was the only one in the entire domain who had reached such a level
of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">520,000
years went past in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
Houwu City is up ahead,” Azurefiend called out as he controlled the
realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Houwu
City?” Ning stared at it from afar. This was a city covered in
countless mysterious runes that levitated within the emptiness of
space. It rippled with formations, and it was surrounded by numerous
levitating continents as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth,” Hegemon Goodsong said quickly, “We cultivators only
have this single city in the entire Blazesun Domain! This is a place
where we can hide and rest while we are adventuring through this
region. The entire city itself is actually a powerful Sithe war-fort
and it is capable of easily defending against any dangers, so long as
the Ruler of the Blazesun Domain doesn’t come and attack in
person.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Ruler of the Blazesun Domain?” Su Youji couldn’t help but ask,
“Who is that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Youji,”
Ning smiled as he explained, “The term ‘Ruler of the Blazesun
Domain’ refers to the most terrifying Sourcewalker located in the
Blazesun Domain. The legends say that he is as powerful as a Sithe
Exalt. His overwhelming power means that he is honored with the title
of ‘Ruler of the Blazesun Domain’. However, in the end he’s
still just a Sourcewalker; he won’t get involved in the affairs of
the cultivator civilizations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
So long as you don’t offend the Blazesun Ruler, he won’t make
trouble for us either,” Hegemon Goodsong said. “After all… we
have the invincible Autarchs on our side! As a result, the supreme
Sourcewalkers don’t dare to go too far. Even if he does become so
crazy as to assault the city of Houwu, the city should be able to
hold on for a while albeit at great cost. Given enough time, most of
the cultivators should be able to flee.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
they spoke, the realmship continued to move towards the levitating
city at high speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”
a loud shout rang out. The city’s entrance was guarded by a golem
guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and send word,” Hegemon Goodsong barked back, “That Daolord
Darknorth has arrived!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?” The golem guard was shocked. “I’ll send word to
Master right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire city of Houwu was in a state of uproar. News spread quite
quickly amongst cultivators, and just a few seconds later the news
that Daolord Darknorth had arrived at the city was known by a
majority of the cultivators here. The Hegemons and Eternal Emperors,
as well as the few fearless Samsara Daolords who had chosen to
adventure in the Blazesun Domain, all came flying out to see what the
legendary Daolord Darknorth looked like.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has arrived?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is he?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look
over there! Daolord Darknorth is flying within the realmship above
the city.” More and more cultivators came pouring out from every
direction, and they all hastened to stare at the main gates in front
of the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick!
Quick! Brother Treewind, Brother Jade Rainbow, Nuwa… all of you,
hurry over here and accompany me in meeting with Daolord Darknorth!”
Lord Houwu was the most impatient of them all. Patriarch Treewind and
Nuwa had been meditating silently, but they were immediately startled
awake and hurriedly came running over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and go welcome them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has arrived?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Patriarch
Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, and Nuwa all grew nervous right
away, with Nuwa being the most nervous of them all. Daolord Darknorth
had come all the way here from the distant Flamedragon Realmverse for
the sake of meeting her!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
green-robed Lord Houwu was the first to fly into the skies, with
Patriarch Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, Nuwa, and the others all
following by his side. The cultivators around the gates all parted
before them, not daring to bar their path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu was at the head of the delegation. Behind him was Patriarch
Treewind and Nuwa, and at the very rear were the other Hegemons and
Emperors. They exited the city gates in an awesome procession. Houwu
City, as a war-fort, was covered with barrier spells. Generally
speaking the barriers would remain sealed, preventing people from
simply flying out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Above
the city hovered that realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am the Governor of Houwu City, and I respectfully welcome Daolord
Darknorth!” The green-robed Lord Houwu immediately bowed
respectfully, his face covered with joy. His Daoist title was
‘Houwu’, and so he had named this war-fort after himself after
acquiring it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
respectfully welcome Daolord Darknorth!” The surrounding Golden
Emperors, Otherverse Lords, Hegemons, Eternal Emperors, and Samsara
Daolords all bowed respectfully as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Faced
with the legendary Daolord Darknorth, these major powers were as
nervous as Ning himself had been when he had first met Autarch
Titanos. The difference in power was simply too great! Even the most
powerful person here would probably be slain by a single blow from
Ning’s sword. How could any of them dare to show the slightest bit
of incivility towards him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
is this Daolord Darknorth?” Nuwa was standing behind Lord Houwu.
She stared into the skies, her heart filled with curiosity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to stand on ceremony.” A wave of power surged out, pressing
against Nuwa’s arms and preventing her from bowing down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the others to show Ning such respect was one thing, but Nuwa was
different. Ning felt a sense of tremendous respect for Mother Nuwa.
Perhaps he was now much stronger than her, but Patriarch Subhuti was
his master. Mother Nuwa had shown great favor to Patriarch Subhuti in
the past, and indeed had done great things for the entire Three
Realms. How could he possibly allow Nuwa to bow towards him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
aura…” Nuwa was secretly startled. In fact, all of the
cultivators were shocked. For his aura alone to be so powerful meant
that Daolord Darknorth lived up to his reputation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Three additional figures came flying out from the
realmship. The first was the chubby Flamewing, the second was the
red-robed Hegemon Goodsong, and the third was Hegemon Azurefiend.
After flying out, they stood slightly behind the white-robed youth
who bore the black sheath on his back. In addition, Ning was flanked
by the simple, muscular Protector Whitethaw and the dazzlingly
beautiful Su Youji.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
white-robed youth had appeared with his entire entourage. His aura
wasn’t all that powerful, and his truesoul was slowly fragmenting
and dissipating. If he was an ordinary Daolord who had failed his
Daomerge, these major powers wouldn’t care about him at all… but
he wasn’t. This white-robed youth caused all of them to feel
nervous and breathless due to the great difference in power between
them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Houwu, sorry for the trouble.” Ning stepped forward, landing on the
ground and smiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was nothing more than conveying a message. It was my honor to be able
to serve you, Daolord Darknorth,” Lord Houwu chortled. A thought
came to his mind, and he hurriedly turned to glance at the nearby
Nuwa: “Daolord Darknorth, this is Nuwa.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
gaze turned towards Nuwa as well. In truth, he already knew for
certain that she was the person he sought, as there was no way to
fake the karma ties between them. When he saw her just now, he felt
absolutely convinced… because he was very familiar with her
appearance. He had spent his entire youth visualizing the [Nuwa
Painting], which was a depiction of Nuwa. How could he NOT be
familiar with her?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
woman before him was the legendary Mother Nuwa of the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at Nuwa, and she stared at him as well, her heart filled with
many questions. She had the vague feeling that there had to be some
sort of connection between them, but she simply couldn’t remember
ever having met this Daolord Darknorth before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
greets you, Nuwa.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
was startled. For the legendary Daolord Darknorth to speak so
courteously to her had caught her offguard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled, and as he did a voice suddenly rang out within Nuwa’s
mind: “Pangu established Heaven and Earth, while Nuwa repaired the
heavens!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_014__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 14: Transmitting the Dao</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
instantly trembled. She stared with disbelief at the white-robed
youth standing before her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“H-he…”
Waves of emotion rippled through Nuwa’s heart. She instantly
understood that Daolord Darknorth knew of her past! Either he came
from the Three Realms or he knew of its history; in short, Daolord
Darknorth definitely knew where the Three Realms was located! Nuwa
had been searching for many years to return to the Three Realms, but
she still had no idea where it was located!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Which
realmverse was the Three Realms in? She had no idea! She spent a
great deal of time searching, but the Bluesky Domain was simply too
far away from the Flamedragon Realmverse. Even a trip via realmship
would take billions of years; even Otherverse Lords and other major
powers would rarely drift to such a great distance. Such a journey
would entail many dangers, after all, and they could easily get lost
or even die. Unless there was an extremely compelling reason, few
would venture to such a great distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
it seems as though this Nuwa before us must be the person you are
searching for, Daolord Darknorth.” Lord Houwu immediately laughed
and said, “To be able to meet at last after being separated by such
a great distance is a joyful thing indeed. There’s no need for us
to speak here outside the city; let’s hurry on inside! I’ve
already prepared a fairly humble banquet to welcome you, Daolord
Darknorth. I hope you’ll show me a bit of face and sit down for a
time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Very well.” Since he had found Nuwa, there was no need
for him to rush into a conversation with her right in front of the
gates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…”
Nuwa stared at Ning, her heart filled with both excitement and
confusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can chat at length later. You have many things to say to me, and I
have much to say to you,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Disciple,
let’s invite Daolord Darknorth into the city first. There’ll be
plenty of time to chat with him later.” Patriarch Treewind and
Imperator Jade Rainbow both behaved with great friendliness as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Nuwa was able to make herself be patient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Led
by Lord Houwu and surrounded by many major powers, Ning entered Houwu
City and travelled to the Lord Governor’s estate. The palace had
already prepared a banquet for them, with the maids quickly
assembling and making themselves up in order to welcome Daolord
Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
come in, Daolord Darknorth.” Lord Houwu immediately led Ning to the
highest seat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t decline, walking up and sitting down in the lotus position.
He smiled: “Gentlemen, please be seated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa,
you can sit over here.” Lord Houwu spoke with great friendliness,
arranging for Nuwa to in the first seat located directly to Ning’s
left. As for Lord Houwu himself, he sat in the first seat to Ning’s
right.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that multiple Otherverse Lords were present. Lord
Houwu himself was an Otherverse Lord; for him as the Lord Governor to
be seated second only to Ning was one thing, but for Nuwa to be
seated similarly? Some of the major powers present couldn’t help
but mumble to themselves, “Lord Houwu truly is going out of his way
to curry favor with Daolord Darknorth.” These major powers were all
treating Ning the same way they would treat an Autarch… and in
truth, many of them had never even met an Autarch in all their lives!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was close to an Autarch in terms of insight, and he had failed his
Daomerge. It was guaranteed that his life would be a brief one, and
so they wanted to seize this chance to befriend him. If they missed
this chance, they would probably never get a second one. Some simple
pointers from Ning would probably be more effective than countless
chaos cycles of training on their own. Most of them had been trapped
at the Hegemon level for many years without making any improvements
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
friends, you have all come here to welcome Daolord Darknorth.” Lord
Houwu’s face was all smiles as he spoke: “As a result, Houwu City
has also been given a chance to host a truly rare banquet. To be able
to meet with Daolord Darknorth is our good fortune. If it wasn’t
for the fact that he was searching for Nuwa, we would probably never
have a chance like this. Let us first offer a toast to Daolord
Darknorth in honor of the karma which brought us together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
toast to the Daolord!” Instantly, all of the major powers lifted up
their cups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Patriarch
Treewind and Imperator Jade Rainbow were considered ordinary powers
here. Only those who were at least at the Hegemon level of power were
seated, while the weaker ones weren’t even permitted to take part.
But of course, Daolord Darknorth’s retainer Su Youji was able to
take part. She was even seated close to the front.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lifted up his own wine cup, downing the wine before replying with a
smile, “No need to be so courteous. Everyone, be more relaxed and
casual. This is my first visit to the Blazesun Domain, which is
filled with countless dangers, many strange lifeforms, and
Sourcewalkers of incredible power. It isn’t easy for cultivators to
stay alive here, and I’ve long heard that the one and only city
which we cultivators have here is the city of Houwu. This place is a
place where we cultivators can rest and be sheltered, and now that
I’m here I can tell that it truly is extraordinary.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is nothing more than a resting stop,” Lord Houwu said humbly. “In
the end, we’re still the weaker party here. Everyone still
acknowledges that the Blazesun Ruler is still that Sourcewalker.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
major powers all chatted in high spirits during this banquet, telling
Daolord Darknorth of all the marvels they had encountered within the
Blazesun Domain. Ning was quite curious as well; although he had
heard of some of the Blazesun Domain’s secrets from Hegemon
Goodsong and Realmslord Windgrace, he still knew very little. As he
listened to one secret after another, he began to gain a clear
understanding of just how marvelous the Blazesun Domain was. As the
major powers continued to converse, they all gradually began to grow
more familiar with each other as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
A Sithe Exalt is trapped here?” Ning said in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
so.” Lord Houwu laughed, “The Blazesun Domain does indeed have a
Sithe Exalt imprisoned within it. An Autarch captured him during the
Dawn War and sent him into the Blazesun Domain, where he has suffered
all sorts of torment ever since.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
just the Blazesun Domain; five of the other seven domains all have a
Sithe Exalt within them!” Next to Lord Houwu was a silver-browed
old man who held a fan in his hands, and he said with a smile, “A
total of six Sithe Exalts have been trapped in the Eight Domains. All
of them were captured during the war and have been tormented ever
since.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning truly was surprised by this. He had heard long ago from Emperor
Waveshift that there were Sithe Exalts trapped somewhere, but he
never would’ve imagined that six of the Eight Domains each had a
Sithe Exalt imprisoned within them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you know why the Autarchs captured them instead of killing them?”
Ning asked, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
idea.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs must have their own plans.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
the Sithe Exalts truly are being constantly tortured. They suffer a
fate worse than death and constantly let out miserable bellows,”
the major powers reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly when he heard this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
if you wish to pay a visit, when you are free I’ll lead you there
myself,” Hegemon Goodsong said. “Although I’ve never visited
myself, I know where it is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning did indeed wish to pay a visit. He had the feeling that
there had to be a profound reason behind the Autarchs imprisoning the
Sithe Exalts here. In fact… why didn’t the Autarchs imprison them
within their own estates rather than in the Eight Domains?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
I’ll know once I visit them,” Ning mused. The other major powers
weren’t able to see through the secrets behind the Sithe Exalts,
but Ning was at a much higher level of insight than them. Perhaps he
would be able to see through to the truth that they could not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced at the nearby Nuwa. This entire time, Nuwa didn’t seem to
really care for the food she was eating. This entire time, she was
trying to guess just who Ning was. Ning laughed, then said in a loud
voice, “I think we should call it a day.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu was caught offguard. He hurriedly rose to his feet and said,
“Daolord, there’s one thing I would like to ask of you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Pray
tell, Lord Governor,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
heard long ago that your Dao of the Sword is unfathomably profound
and abstruse, Daolord,” Lord Houwu said. “I, Houwu, am focused on
cultivation. I go out adventuring and brave many dangers, all for the
sake of finding new insights. I wasn’t able to become much more
powerful, but I did find this city! To me, however… what I truly
desire is to be able to walk farther along the path of the Dao. I’ve
always wished to become apprenticed to an Autarch, but never had the
chance. Now that you are before me, Daolord, how could I give up a
chance like this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Lord Houwu spoke, he immediately knelt down and kowtowed towards
Ning, then said respectfully, “Houwu is willing to follow you,
Daolord, and obey your orders. I only beg that you are willing to
transmit the Dao unto me and let me see a vaster, more profound Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Transmit
the Dao?” Everyone in the hall fell silent. All of the major powers
turned to stare at Lord Houwu in a rather unhappy manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Lord Houwu had merely asked for Ning to provide him with some
guidance, that would be fine. It was a bit much for him to curry
favor with Ning in order to gain from it, but Ning would’ve been
alright with that. The problem was, Lord Houwu had actually requested
that Ning ‘transmit the Dao’ to him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
did ‘transmit the Dao’ mean? It meant for Ning to actually
transmit his full Dao to Lord Houwu in its entirety!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Divine
Sovereign Goldsun had given Ning a Golden Emperor body, and even then
Ning had only given him three days of guidance without actually
transmitting his Eternal Omega Sword Dao to him. This was the only
Eternal Omega Dao which had ever existed in the entire Chaosverse;
its value was truly incalculable! Daoist Bluestone had paid an
enormous price just to view the Daolord-level Omega Sword Dao… and
now, Ning had upgraded it to become an Eternal Omega Sword Dao! How
was it that Lord Houwu even dared to make a request like this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sat there on his seat, staring down at the kowtowing Lord Houwu. His
gaze grew cold. “And why the hell should I transmit my Dao to you?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_015__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 15: Private Talks</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
why the hell should I transmit my Dao to you?” Ji Ning’s icy
voice continued to echo within the silent hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
atmosphere within the entire hall seemed to have frozen over. The
other major powers were secretly speechless at how rash Lord Houwu
was behaving! Although Daolord Darknorth was supposedly an amiable
person, he was still a figure of terrifying power who could wipe them
out with ease. How could someone behave so impetuously before a
person like him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of the major powers here would dare to do such a thing. Only someone
who was as crazy as Lord Houwu would!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu continued to kneel there on the ground, his heart shaking. He
was rather afraid as well! He was afraid that Daolord Darknorth would
kill him… but he still chose to take this action. By his very
nature, he was a risk-taker. That was why he had established a city
for cultivators within the Blazesun Domain!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire Blazesun Domain only had a single city in it. Logically
speaking, someone who had acquired a Sithe war-fort would put it
within his own citadel or realmverse; that was normal and made sense.
Lord Houwu, however, had insisted on putting it within the Blazesun
Domain instead. This was a testament to his personality and the type
of person he was; he dared to do the things which others did not!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Lord Houwu saw it, even if he failed in his request, the warm way in
which he had welcomed Daolord Darknorth should at least ensure that
he wouldn’t be killed out of hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu knelt there, suppressing his terror as he spoke, “Daolord, I
haven’t been able to improve in the Dao despite the passage of
countless years. I simply cannot accept this. Now that you have
appeared, I finally see hope. I am willing to give up everything for
this opportunity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
up everything?” Ning’s face had been icy cold, but now a hint of
a smile played across the corner of his lips. The kneeling Lord
Houwu, however, was unable to see it. “Very well. Give me your city
and all of your treasures, including your Universe treasures. Only
then would I accept you… and even then, I’ll only teach you
whenever I’m in the mood. Do you accept?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu was stunned. He was to give up everything? He had risked his
life countless times to acquire his treasures, to have the foundation
and fortitude needed to establish a city here in the Blazesun Domain.
Without his Sithe treasures, he would merely be an ordinary figure
amongst the other major powers. Lord Houwu’s body felt limp and
weak. Was he really able to give up all of these things?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was not! Even if he did acquire the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, he
wouldn’t necessarily be able to improve all that much. He would,
however, lose all of his Sithe treasures. He simply couldn’t accept
this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Clearly,
you aren’t able to ‘give up everything’.” Ning calmly rose to
his feet, then began to walk towards a side room. “There’s no
need for any of you to follow.” As he spoke he nodded towards Nuwa,
who immediately moved to enter the side room with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
after Ning left did sound return to the hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Houwu, you truly are bold. I’d never dare to act as you just did.”
Some other major powers walked over, while Lord Houwu rose to his
feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
dummy.” The only person in the hall who was still eating was the
Flamewing God, and it raised his head to glance at Lord Houwu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dummy?”
Lord Houwu looked back at Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know exactly what type of person my master is. There’s no way he’d
take advantage over one of his students like that! If you really said
that you were willing to offer everything to Master and obey him in
all things, I can guarantee that there’s no way he’d actually
take your crappy treasures.” Flamewing snickered as it shook its
head. “A pity. You missed your chance, and you won’t get another
one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah?!”
A look of regret and sorrow appeared on Lord Houwu’s face. Alas, he
wasn’t really familiar with the type of person Daolord Darknorth
was, and he truly wasn’t able to give up all of those treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Most
importantly of all, when Ning spoke he had infused his voice with a
sort of natural illusion which ensured that Lord Houwu would be
completely focused on this choice. If he truly was determined in
pursuing the Dao at any cost, Ning probably would’ve nodded and
accepted him. However, he had failed the test. This was proof that
his Dao-heart was insufficiently resilient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the side hall. Only two people were here; the first was Ning, while
the second was Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sit.
We can speak at length now.” Ning felt rather emotional as he
stared at the woman before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa…
she was a legend to the Three Realms. But of course, Ning himself was
now a legend of the Three Realms as well. Back when he was very young
and weak, his first step on the path of cultivation had been him
visualizing the [Nuwa Diagram]. Now, the two most dazzling
cultivators of the Three Realms had come together in the Blazesun
Domain, a place which was incomparably distant from the Three Realms.
Destiny truly was a marvelous, unfathomable thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, can you tell me where the Three Realms is located?” Nuwa
asked the question which she wanted to ask above all others.
Cultivators were blessed with long lives, but spending all that time
without even knowing where home was located was a source of pain and
torment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
she had been born a Chaos Primordial, a creature who was born into
solitude and lonely wanderings, that would’ve been one thing… but
she had been born into the Pangu Chaosworld and then lived in the
Three Realms. She had fought for that place, and that was where all
of her friends were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms is located in the Flamedragon Realmverse,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it really is there!” Nuwa nodded. “When I heard that you came
from the Flamedragon Realmverse, Daolord Darknorth, and that you were
searching for me, I immediately began to suspect that the Three
Realms might be located there. However, the Flamedragon Realmverse is
extremely far away from the Blazesun Domain. When I left the Three
Realms, I encountered a spatial tempest within that dimensional
corridor and ended up being lost. I appeared here within the Blazesun
Domain. I never would’ve dared to imagine that I had drifted so far
from home.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather surprised: “Really? So you really did lose your way
within the dimensional passageway and end up arriving in the Blazesun
Domain?” It took billions of years when travelling by realmship to
cross such a great distance. How could she have ended up in such a
distant place just because she was ‘lost’? This was crazy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Nuwa nodded. “Back then, I was merely a World-level cultivator. How
could I, all by myself, have travelled from the Three Realms to the
Blazesun Domain?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Domain…” Ning was intrigued. “Actually, on this
journey to the Blazesun Domain I had the vague feeling that this
place is truly quite extraordinary. Now that you tell me that you
came here from the Three Realms after being lost in space… the
secrets within the Blazesun Domain are most likely even greater than
I suspected.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Secrets?”
Nuwa was curious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I can discover them, I’ll let you know,” Ning laughed. “I’ve
failed my Daomerge, after all. That means I’m going to die. There’s
no need for me to hold anything back from you.” Ning had already
decided that Nuwa would be the one to protect the Three Realms on his
behalf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… can you tell me who you are, exactly?” Nuwa couldn’t
help but ask, “Why is it that you know of me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Ning laughed. “My master is Patriarch Subhuti of the Tristar
Crescent Abode of Mount Innerheart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Subhuti?!”
Nuwa was stunned. “Y-you are Subhuti’s disciple?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
n-never would’ve imagined that you…” Nuwa had a complex look on
her face. She remembered those years, those battles she had
experienced alongside those lifelong friends. Back then, none of them
had any guidance from the outside world at all. They had to blindly
find their own paths for cultivation. Pangu had perished after
establishing Heaven and Earth, and so Nuwa had become the leader of
the group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Subhuti,
Three Purities, Tathagata, Suiren… are they doing well?” Nuwa
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
blinked, then shook his head. “My master Subhuti is still alive,
but Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Suiren,
Shennong, Fuxi, as well as many of the other Immortals and Fiendgods
of the Three Realms have perished, as have Keeper Everwood and
Daomother Devilhand of the Seamless Gate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Nuwa was stunned. She had been born from the primordial chaos itself.
To her, those ancient Fiendgods were her family, her kith and kin who
she had fought alongside. How was it that they had all died?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
were two instigators behind their deaths. The first was Patriarch
Demonheart,” Ning said, “While the other was Old Man Yuan.”
Ning immediately narrated the tale of what had happened during that
era.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
was surprised to hear that the number one Sword Immortal of the Three
Realms, Daofather Fuju, had actually been World God Northrest. She
was enraged to hear of what the Seamless Gate did! She felt regret
that she hadn’t slain Patriarch Demonheart, while she felt pain
over Houyi’s death. Most of all, she felt incredible sorrow when
she heard of how many of her old friends in the Three Realms had
chosen to perish via self-detonation in an attempt to take out Old
Man Yuan. Tears began to fill her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alas.”
Nuwa let out a gentle sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
battle truly was a calamitous one,” Ning said softly. “I simply
hadn’t been training long enough back then. In truth, I’ve always
been hoping to be able to revive them all in the future as well…
but when they self-detonated, their souls and truesouls were
shattered. To bring them back to life is far, far too difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t go into detail as to why. If even a Celestial Immortal like
Yu Wei was very difficult to revive, Three Purities and the others
would be nearly impossible to bring back. All of them had been
incredible figures who had been blessed with the essence of Autarch
Awakener’s godgems. How incredibly hard would it be to revive
them?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, I failed my Daomerge. I failed by just a thread.” Ning
shook his head. “Ever since I failed the Daomerge, I’ve been
wanting to find news of you. I could sense that you were still alive!
I’m going to die, and the one thing I cannot help but worry about
is the Three Realms. I wish to find a protector for the Three Realms,
but I just cannot trust anyone else with it. But if you, Nuwa, were
present… I wouldn’t feel nearly as worried as I do currently.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning spoke, he waved his hand. A series of treasures appeared before
them, with the most important one being a jade slip. This jade slip
emanated a terrifying aura of power even though it simply levitated
there in the air, and its aura was so strong that Nuwa could barely
breathe.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_016__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 16: Soldiers Descend on Houwu City</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
total of four treasures were hovering in front Ji Ning. The first was
a silver throne, the second was a set of beautiful silver robes, ,
the third was a blood-colored diamond, while the fourth was a jade
slip. The first three were the Sithe weapons which the Lonely King
had often used.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
three Sithe weapons, I acquired after I slew the Lonely King of the
Icepeak Army,” Ning said with a laugh. “The silver robes are
protective in nature, while the blood-colored gemstone can instantly
unleash attacks of incredible power which are so fast that even
Otherverse Lords might perish if caught off-guard! In fact, there
truly have been Otherverse Lords who have perished to the Lonely King
as a result of this gemstone. The silver throne, however, is the most
important treasure. It allows one to warp through space, create
multiple illusory clones, and even launch attacks. At full power, its
attacks can destroy an entire otherverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
was shocked upon hearing this. These three treasures truly were
extraordinary! If all three were used together, even most Otherverse
Lords would feel a sense of fear. The Lonely King had relied upon
them more than anything else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Starting
today, these three Sithe treasures shall belong to you.” Ning
looked at Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t accept this,” Nuwa rejected instinctively. Although they
had adventured to a Sithe armory and she had acquired a treasure, any
of the treasures which the Lonely King had used to dominate the
Chaosverse was vastly superior to hers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
decline. I’ve failed the Daomerge and won’t use energy without a
good reason,” Ning said. “And… a casual blow from me would be
more powerful than these treasures by far. In the Three Realms, my
master Subhuti and the others are incapable of using these treasures.
The only person in the Three Realms who can use them is you, Nuwa!
With these treasures, you’ll be strong enough to protect the Three
Realms. Accept them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
wasn’t the wishy-washy type. She immediately nodded: “Very well.
I’ll accept them. The Three Realms is my home; of course I’ll
protect it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. “As for this slip, it contains my Eternal Omega Sword Dao.
I’ve recorded it all here, and no one has ever viewed it before.”
Ning chuckled. “Take a look and see if it can give you a few new
ideas.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eternal
Omega Sword Dao?” Nuwa stared at the levitating jade slip. Its aura
continued to cause her to feel a sense of shock. She knew that
compared to the first three treasures, the jade slip was the most
valuable treasure of them all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you.” Nuwa didn’t decline, nor could she decline. She reached out
to gently touch the jade slip, then instantly sent out her godsense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
flood of information entered her mind. The first thing Nuwa did was
to swear a lifeblood oath that she could only allow members of the
Three Realms to study the Eternal Omega Sword Dao. But of course, if
she herself was able to glean certain insights from the Eternal Omega
Sword Dao she wouldn’t be limited in her ability to transmit them
to others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Sword Dao…” Nuwa was stunned when she sensed how vast and
overwhelmingly powerful the Eternal Omega Sword Dao was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Accept
the jade slip. You can view it and ruminate on it as you please,”
Ning said. The Eternal Omega Sword Dao was simply far too profound;
not even a direct transmission into one’s mind could allow one to
brute-force memorize it all! If you read through it quickly, you’d
soon begin to forget it all. Your memories would grow blurry…
because this was something which vastly surpassed your ability to
understand it! You had to have the jade slip by your side and
constantly meditate on it and study it. As a result, the jade slip
itself was incredibly important. This was why Ning had requested that
Nuwa only allow the members of the Three Realms to be trained in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Nuwa accepted the jade slip, then sat down in the lotus position and
began to meditate on it. She was completely consumed by it,
completely intoxicated by this truly grand Dao. As for Ning, he sat
down next to her as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
this sword-art seemed to have its own spirit. Why is it that it is so
marvelous and agile?” Nuwa raised her head and asked, her fingers
demonstrating as she spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to demonstrate his sword-arts while answering each of her
questions. Ning held nothing back from Nuwa at all, because once he
died and his Dao vanished, Nuwa would become the most powerful expert
of the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had been able to vaguely scry parts of the future. He was able to see
that Nuwa would indeed continue to safeguard the Three Realms and
that she was definitely worthy of his trust. But of course, there
were many other images that had appeared as he scryed the future. In
the end, the future was in a state of flux. Since it had yet to
actually happen, all things were technically possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, Ning had spent more than half a year guiding
Nuwa as she trained. Nuwa was completely absorbed with training in
the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, and for Ning to personally instruct her
and resolve her questions was a truly rare opportunity. Ning wouldn’t
even be this detailed when teaching his own students! As for Lord
Houwu or Patriarch Treewind, none of them dared to disturb the two.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a terrifying wave of power suddenly spread out into the city from
afar. Ning frowned and rose to his feet. He walked over to the
entrance to take a look towards the distant horizons. He could sense
that a vague, malevolent aura was surging towards them from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” Nuwa rose to her feet and walked over to the entrance as
well. “Something feels wrong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can sense that a force is drawing near,” Ning said. “And it is
quite strong. Let’s go take a look.” Ning and Nuwa flew out
side-by-side. In truth, figures were flying out from residences
throughout Houwu City. These Hegemons, Emperors, and Samsara Daolords
could all sense the increasingly powerful ripples generated by the
encroaching power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Flamewing, Su Youji, Whitethaw, Azurefiend, and Hegemon Goodsong all
immediately flew towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord.”
Lord Houwu flew out as well, behaving as warmly as before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Governor,” Ning asked, “What’s going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu hesitated slightly. Suddenly, a figure appeared at the
horizons. This was something who had four hooved legs but the upper
body of a human. This strange creature was as crimson as blood, and
it galloped through the skies. These creatures were wielding all
sorts of weapons, including greataxes or heavy warhammers. They all
radiated auras of tremendous power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Crimson
bloodfiends?” Lord Houwu growled, “Over a hundred crimson
bloodfiends have appeared at the same time?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the hundred-plus crimson bloodfiends galloped towards them. Moments
later, towering eight-armed giants whose bodies were as white as snow
suddenly began to appear as well. The many eight-armed giants each
had just a single eye, and they let out furious roars as their
awesome auras spread out as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
were all unique lifeforms… but what truly surprised Ning was that
all the members of these two races had reached the Hegemon level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
are incredibly powerful races… and for the two to appear at the
same time?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was surprised. “Lord Houwu, does this happen often here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
We rarely see such powerful beings.” Lord Houwu was puzzled as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
the two races of creatures split apart into two sides, revealing
three figures in their midst.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
the left was a towering crimson bloodfiend whose entire body was
covered with golden armor. The fiend wielded a double-edged battleaxe
which was covered with runes and emanated a shocking aura of power;
clearly, this was a very unique Sithe weapon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
the right was an eight-armed giant who was holding a set of fiery
chains. Most of the fiery chains were wrapped around him, and his
aura was just as terrifying as the fiend’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
there was a red-robed maiden in the center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
faces of quite a few cultivators turned gray when they saw these
three appear. “Them?!” Lord Houwu’s face tightened as well.
“Where did they come from?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned as well. Although he didn’t know who these three people
were, he could roughly estimate how strong they were. The three
leaders… two were unique lifeforms, while the other was a
Sourcewalker. All three of them were extremely strong, significantly
stronger than most Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden stepped forward to stand in front of her allies. She
said: “All cultivators of Houwu City, hear my commands!” Her
voice was ice cold and it shook every part of the region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have come on orders from the Ruler of the Blazesun Domain. I have
come to Houwu City to capture five cultivators.” The red-robed
maiden waved her hand as she spoke, causing a scroll to instantly
unfurl and reveal a total of five images. These were images of
Patriarch Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, Nuwa, and the other two.
In the images, Patriarch Treewind and the others were advancing
carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Same
rules as always.” The red-robed maiden actually glanced at
Patriarch Treewind, then at Nuwa who stood behind Ning. “Hand the
five of them over and we won’t harm anyone else. If you dare to
refuse… then that means Houwu City shall enter yet another war
against us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
total of more than two hundred Hegemonic creatures were hovering in
the air behind the three leaders. The pressure they brought upon the
cultivators was quite enormous… and they were backed by the even
more powerful Blazesun Ruler. This was a threat which another type of
civilization was levying against the cultivators… and here in the
Eight Domains, the cultivator civilizations were clearly the weaker
party.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Walker
Scarletbind,” Lord Houwu called out loudly, “Can you tell us how
they have offended the Blazesun Ruler?” The Blazesun Ruler was one
of the most supreme of Sourcewalkers, comparable to Sithe Exalts in
power. So long as an Autarch didn’t intervene, these creatures were
invincible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
These five thieves actually dared to barge into one of the Ruler’s
hidden residences. They caused an enormous amount of damage and wiped
the place clean. They even destroyed one of the Ruler’s favorite
treasures, the Jadeheart Lamp! The Ruler was infuriated by this, and
so he sent the order to capture them and bring them back. They are to
be tortured to death! Otherwise, there’s no way he can give vent to
his rage,” the red-robed maiden said angrily.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_017__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 17: Battle Erupts</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Patriarch
Treewind, Imperator Jade Rainbow, Nuwa, and the others all turned
pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
fine disciple you have, Treewind!” Imperator Jade Rainbow instantly
sent a frantic mental message: “A ‘Sithe armory’? It was
actually one of the Blazesun Ruler’s hidden estates. We’re in
serious trouble now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
the use of saying all of this now? When we broke through layers of
formations and penetrated to the very depths of the estate, we
already suspected that this was actually a place which belonged to
the Blazesun Ruler, right? You still chose to take the Sithe
treasures away with you. The entire reason we chose to hide within
Houwu City was because we wanted to see what would happen next!”
Patriarch Treewind said angrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
it.” Imperator Jade Rainbow was extremely nervous. He glanced at
the white-robed youth standing next to Lord Houwu, then sent
mentally, “Old man Treewind, do you think Daolord Darknorth would
be willing to help us out? And… do you think he can beat the
Blazesun Ruler?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hard
to say,” Patriarch Treewind sent back. “If he was in perfect
shape with unfettered access to his divine power and Immortal ki?
Given how he was able to slay the Lonely King with just one strike,
he definitely wouldn’t need to fear the Blazesun Ruler. Even if he
wasn’t able to win, Daolord Darknorth would definitely be able to
defend against him! The problem is that he has failed his Daomerge,
which means he can’t battle for too long. It’ll probably be very
hard for him to fight against the Blazesun Ruler, who is in perfect
shape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.”
Imperator Jade Rainbow said nervously, “I hope Daolord Darknorth
cares about Nuwa to defend her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. Of course he had to protect Nuwa! He’d protect her even at
the cost of his own life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,
release a bit of your aura,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Need
me to attack?” Flamewing asked rather eagerly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be impatient,” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine!”
Flamewing immediately flew into the air while returning to his true
form. The enormous, flame-bathed body of the Flamewing God appeared
in the skies, emanating an aura of inexhaustible power. As a Chaos
Primordial, its energy stores were virtually limitless, and its body
was all but indestructible. Even Sithe Exalts had to attack in
numbers; a single one wouldn’t be able to do anything to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Chaos Primordial!” The mighty experts serving the Blazesun Ruler
were all shocked, while the three leaders felt a sense of
trepidation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordial, why are you standing with cultivators?” the crimson
bloodfiend leader roared angrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
come on orders from the Blazesun Ruler. Are you going to make an
enemy out of him?” the eight-armed chain-bearing giant roared
angrily as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
two idiots,” the red-robed maiden muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
the hell is the Blazesun-whatever? I don’t know him!” Flamewing
bellowed back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden secretly felt helpless. All Chaos Primordials had
the intelligence of children, and they were born completely fearless.
Nothing and no one could control them! Yes, the Blazesun Ruler might
have the power of a Sith Exalt and was indeed stronger than
Flamewing… so what if he was? He still wouldn’t be able to
capture Flamewing, much less kill it! There was nothing the Blazesun
Ruler could do to this troublemaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordial, why must you interfere? This is an affair between us and
these cultivators,” the red-robed maiden said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
with all the questions?!” Flamewing bellowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “It is true that the five of them offended the Ruler by
trespassing on his estate, but they weren’t aware that it belonged
to him. They thought that it was a relic site of some sort. Although
they are in the wrong, capital punishment would not be fitting. I’ll
have them return all the treasures they took to the Blazesun Ruler
and have this matter be brought to the end. Is that acceptable?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that a puny little Daolord speaking?” the red-robed maiden glanced
downwards with a smirk. “And one who failed the Daomerge at that.
You actually dare to speak?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
my master!” Flamewing bellowed, turning to look at Ning. “Master,
let me eat them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be impatient.” Ning continued, “A minor matter like this isn’t
worth starting a war with us over.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
A Daolord was actually able to tame a Chaos Primordial? This Chaos
Primordial truly is a fool.” The red-robed maiden chuckled. “As
for this being a ‘minor matter’? Hmph. The Jadeheart Lamp was
something which the Ruler loved dearly. If all they had done was
steal a few treasures, this matter would be at an end after they
returned them… but they caused a large amount of wanton destruction
and even wrecked the lamp! No one can save them now. Lord Houwu,
don’t hide in the back! Speak! Are you going to hand them over or
not? If not, we’re going to attack.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
Lord Houwu turned frantically towards Ning. Based on how he normally
handled things, he would lower his head and endure the threats while
trying to come up with a way to let Patriarch Treewind and the others
flee. As for whether or not Patriarch Treewind would perish during
their flight, that was up to luck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Make
your choice!” the red-robed maiden barked coldly, while the two
leaders by her side emanated auras of murderous malice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seeing
this, Ning frowned. He immediately instructed, “Flamewing, attack
with all your power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahahaha!”
Flamewing had been waiting for just this order. Delighted, it
immediately charged forwards while belching out that dark-red fire
from its mouth. The flames covered the entire region, spread out in
every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
crimson bloodfiends and the eight-armed giants were all instantly
swept up within the flames. Although it felt rather painful, they
were still in fine shape. These special beings were born with more
powerful bodies than cultivators, after all! More importantly, they
had always lived within the Blazesun Domain and thus were born with a
fondness and affinity to fire. As a result, fire wasn’t all that
harmful to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
bodies were extremely sturdy, but they would still die if the fire
made its way inside of them. But of course, there was no way they
would allow the flames to enter their bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
that Chaos Primordial!” the red-robed maiden commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
it to us!” The crimson bloodfiend leader and the eight-armed giant
leader both charged forwards, but they were clearly quite a bit
slower and wouldn’t be able to catch up to Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Two of the eight-armed giants were torn into tiny pieces in
the blink of an eye, the pieces then burnt to ashes by the flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
it!” The two leaders were stunned and enraged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is quite fast, much faster than the last Chaos Primordial I saw.”
The red-robed maiden frowned slightly as a semi-translucent
dirt-colored gemstone appeared in her palm. She waved her hand,
casuing a series of black tentacles to appear out of nowhere and
reach out towards Flamewing. These black tentacles were incredibly
tough and took no damage from the flames which Flamewing belched out.
A total of eight tentacles were created, and they came from all
directions, making it impossible for Flamewing to avoid them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
Flamewing used its sharp claws to tear them apart by force while also
biting at them. One tentacle after another was severed, but they
continued to tighten around them. Flamewing had so much brute force
that it was still able to split the tentacles apart, but they would
then regrow to coil around it once more. This caused Flamewing’s
speed to drop drastically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
Sourcewalker!” The enraged Flamewing moved to pounce towards the
red-robed maiden.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
it in its tracks,” the red-robed maiden instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The crimson bloodfiend leader struck out with its giant double-bladed
battleaxe towards Flamewing, while the eight-armed giant sent its
chains flying out and lashing towards Flamewing like a whip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Bang! The crimson bloodfiend leader and the eight-armed giant leader
continuously attacked Flamewing, while the red-robed maiden continued
to use her tentacles to bind and slow Flamewing down. For a time,
Flamewing found itself surrounded and unable to break free.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goodsong,
go and help Flamewing out,” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Got
it.” Hegemon Goodsong was filled with the desire for battle, and he
transformed into a streak of golden light that flew straight towards
the four. However, halfway there he was slapped back by a black
tentacle. That single black tentacle was enough to completely tie him
down for a time. Hegemon Goodsong was just barely able to break it
apart, but it then quickly regrew. Clearly, he was still quite a bit
weaker than the Sourcewalker was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned when he saw this. The two armies of strange creatures had yet
to attack. If all of the cultivators of Houwu City all took part in
this fight, they would naturally be able to defend against this
attack! However, their foe still held the upper hand in the Blazesun
Domain. If the Blazesun Ruler gave the order, even more Sourcewalkers
and strange creatures would appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,”
Nuwa sent mentally, “Perhaps we should back down and pretend to
negotiate with them, then immediately flee. Given our fleeing
abilities and your assistance, we should be able to escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the Blazesun Domain. The Blazesun Ruler’s influence is too
great,” Ning sent back. “Even if you are able to temporarily
flee, you’ll probably be caught soon. Resolving this matter here is
the best solution.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment, the red-robed maiden glanced downwards and shouted,
“Did you think you’d be able to resist us just because you have a
Chaos Primordial? The Blazesun Ruler has always been courteous to you
cultivators, but do you really think that he is someone to be trifled
with? You wrecked his estate and destroyed his beloved lamp. The five
of them have to die! Obey my orders and attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The crimson bloodfiends and the eight-armed giants simultaneously let
out earth-shaking bellows, then began to swoop down from the skies.
An aura of endless might enveloped the entire city of Houwu.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_018__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 18: Ji Ning Attacks</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the cultivators inside Houwu City saw that swarm of creatures
swooping down towards them, they couldn’t help but start to panic
slightly. In truth, they were unwilling to fight with these creatures
to the death. According to the customary rule, everyone would just
help out a bit to give the person who caused the problem a chance to
flee; that was as far as everyone was willing to go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
problem was, this time the one standing behind Patriarch Treewind and
Nuwa was Daolord Darknorth. Thus, they hesitated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you, enter the city!” Lord Houwu immediately barked mentally,
then turned to look at Ning desperately. “Daolord Darknorth, what
should…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
it wasn’t for Ning, Lord Houwu would’ve followed the usual rule.
There was no way he would be hesitating for this long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head to stare upwards at the throng of creatures swooping
down towards them. Suddenly, the ‘ordinary’ aura surrounding Ning
began to dramatically skyrocket in power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom!!! The skies above the city of Houwu began to shake as
countless streams of sword-light appeared out of nowhere. Many
millions of swords manifested with Ning at the center, and all of
them hung up high. In a single instant, the entire region had
transformed into a world of swords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
creatures which had been furiously swooping down towards Houwu City
came to a sudden, startled pause. The crimson bloodfiends and
eight-armed giants stared at the sword-light in terror, not daring to
move at all. They could sense how sharp the sword-light was, and in
fact some of them were nicked by the sword-light, causing wounds to
appear on their bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
all understood that the omnipresent sword-light was able to
annihilate them all with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is…” the crimson bloodfiend leader, the eight-armed giant leader,
and the red-robed maiden were all stunned as they stared at the
countless streams of sword-light in the world around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a world of the sword. Some of the sword-light seemed lively and
joyful, some seemed moody and ghostly. Some were filled with
malevolence, others were ephemeral and drifting. The countless
streams of sword-light combined to form a perfect world of the sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Commander?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Clan
leader!” The crimson bloodfiends and the eight-armed giants all
turned to stare at their leaders. They were filled with terror that
sprang from within their very bones.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden swallowed, hard. Her face was rather ashen, and she
stared with a degree of fear at the white-robed youth who continued
to stand there calmly. “He’s too terrifying. He hasn’t even
attacked; all he’s done is unleashed his domain, and it’s already
terrifying. T-t-this domain… most likely, there’s no way Hegemons
can survive it at all. They’d be wiped out instantly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was indeed Ning’s Sword Dao domain! Or, to put it another way, this
was a domain formed by the prime essences of the Dao of the Sword!
Anyone who wasn’t powerful enough would be slaughtered with ease by
this domain. Ning didn’t wish to intensify the problems between him
and the Blazesun Ruler; otherwise, the terrified creatures would’ve
all been wiped out long ago, save for perhaps those three leaders. It
wouldn’t have cost him a single scrap of his own power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
scene stunned all of the cultivators within Houwu City.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the power of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao?” They stared at
the omnipresent streaks of sword-light in the skies. They could sense
how terrifyingly powerful the sword-light was. Daolord Darknorth had
reached such a terrifying level of power that he didn’t even need
to personally strike; his domain alone could effortlessly annihilate
anyone below the Otherverse Lord level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
THIS is the real Daolord Darknorth!” Patriarch Treewind said with a
sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems we’ll survive this,” Imperator Jade Rainbow said, still
filled with awe and fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Houwu raised his head to stare at the skies, his gaze filled with
envy. “If only Daolord Darknorth was willing to transmit the Dao to
me…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Right now, there were two people who cared about Ning the most. The
first was Su Youji, while the second was Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two of them truly cared about Ning’s life. For him to merely
release a Dao domain was one thing, but if he truly wished to kill
the three leaders he would have to use his own energies… which was
akin to Ning using up his own lifespan! Su Youji’s feelings towards
Ning went without saying, and while Nuwa had only met Ning a short
while ago she already viewed him as one of her closest friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Her
homeland had produced such a dazzling genius… someone who, even
after failing the Daomerge, cared enough to then seek her out to
ensure that she would safeguard the Three Realms. Nuwa felt a sense
of admiration towards Ning; she naturally didn’t wish for Ning to
use up any more of his life energy. This was doubly true because Ning
was getting into this dispute for her sake!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two hundred-plus Hegemonic creatures all stood in midair, terrified.
None of them dared to move at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“S-s-s-senior!”
The double-bladed battleaxe-wielding crimson bloodfiend leader was
the most frightened of them all. Even his voice quavered when he
spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to sweep them with his gaze, and as he did the three leaders
felt a sense of terror rise in their hearts. This Dao domain had
completely enveloped the surrounding area and suppressed everything
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Scram!”
Ning barked coldly, his voice echoing for countless kilometers
around. The crimson bloodfiend leader lowered his head and gulped, so
terrified that he immediately turned tail and fled. As for the other
crimson bloodfiends under his command, they all followed him in
fleeing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
ashen-faced red-robed maiden took two steps back. She was hesitating.
As a Sourcewalker, she was extremely intelligent and possessed
tremendous skills of comprehension. She could naturally tell how
terrifying this Daolord was… but the Blazesun Ruler truly was
extremely angry. She wanted to try and negotiate and see if a better
resolution was possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the eight-armed giant, he stared intently at Ning without backing
down in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden spoke out: “I am Walker Scarletbind, and I serve
the Blazesun Ruler. Dare I ask who you are, senior?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Scarletbind
greets you, Daolord Darknorth.” For the first time, the red-robed
maiden bowed her head with great respect. She showed nothing but
disdain when meeting with other cultivators, but as soon as she saw
the sword-light flooding the skies she understood just how terrifying
this cultivator Daolord was, and how worthy of respect he was. His
skill in sword-arts alone vastly surpassed the Blazesun Ruler she
served.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Walker
Scarletbind.” Ning nodded. “I imagine you understand what I am
intending. I do not wish for a battle to arise between the Blazesun
Ruler and myself. A minor matter like this isn’t worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
do understand,” the red-robed maiden said respectfully, “But…
this time, the Ruler is extremely angry. I’m afraid that he won’t
just let things rest.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Scarletbind,
why are you wasting time on him? You there! Cultivator Daolord!”
The eight-armed giant let out an earth-shaking shout: “What
technique did you use to unleash this domain of swords? However…
this thing isn’t a threat to me at all! Your sword domain is
harmless to me. I’ll kill you with one lash of my chains. Let’s
see how long you can maintain your arrogance then!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eight-Armed
Hill, do NOT be rude,” the red-robed maiden said frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be fooled, Scarletbind! This cultivator Daolord is just putting up a
false front of bravado. Cultivators love to lie, cheat, and steal,
but all of them are very weak. He’s just a Daolord! How strong can
he be?” The eight-armed giant leader forced down the fear he had
felt earlier, transforming it into rage at the thought of having been
deceived by Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
the eight-armed giant leader howled as he ran through the air towards
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
The red-robed maiden hurriedly waved her hand, sending out one of the
black tentacles and intending to use it to catch the eight-armed
giant. However, the eight-armed giant’s chains began to clatter and
clack, smashing the black tentacles apart. The eight-armed giant
howled loudly, “Scarletbind, do you think I don’t know all your
little tricks?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight-armed giant turned towards Ning once more. “DIE!” His
chains clanked with terrifying power that was nearly equivalent to
the Flamewing God’s as he struck out at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden felt both frantic and helpless. These creatures all
had a far lower level of intelligence. Chaos Primordials weren’t so
bad; they simply had childlike personalities. These creatures,
however, had personalities as bizarre as their appearances. Some were
sly, some were sinister, some were stupid, some were brutish… and
as for this eight-armed giant, he was famous for his explosive
temper. He easily went berserk… and now, he had just gone berserk
again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I’ll go stop him!” Flamewing moved to charge out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
it to me!” Ning commanded coldly. Flamewing stared wide-eyed at
Ning, as did Nuwa and Su Youji from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
not!” Nuwa said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing
won’t be able to dispose of him. It’ll keep causing trouble for
us.” Ning stared at the distant eight-armed giant, which had almost
instantly charged towards him. A murderous look was in Ning’s eyes
which caused all the major powers present to hold their breaths. At
his current level, Ning was invincible in all the Chaosverse against
everyone save the Autarchs. How could he not feel a degree of pride
in himself?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning stepped forward as well. All the cultivators in Houwu City
raised their heads to look, with Patriarch Treewind and Nuwa staring
particularly intently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this instant, time itself seemed to have froze. Ning stepped forward
in a graceful and casual manner, and as he did so space itself seemed
to have shrunk between him and the eight-armed giant. He instantly
appeared in front of the giant, whose eyes had been filled with
berserk savagery… but in the next instant, the look in the giant’s
eyes was replaced by a hint of shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning struck out with his sword. All of the cultivators present were
able to see with clarity how Ning drew a single black sword from the
sheath on his back, and then as part of the same motion delivered a
chopping blow downwards.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_019__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 19: Blazesun Ruler</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
godlike sword carved through the air, leaving behind streaks of
sword-light that looked like petals frozen in the air. The streaks of
sword-light then all connected to each other into a beautiful arc,
and it was as though the dazzling, snow-white sword-light had come
alive. It was like a dazzling snow flower that had bloomed with
breathtaking beauty, and the petals of that flower just so happened
to pass through the eight-armed giant’s body, leaving behind a
single giant wound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning’s sword-intent spread out through the power of karma,
instantly annihilating every scrap of truesoul the eight-armed giant
possessed. The giant’s life energy instantly vanished… but the
dazzlingly beautiful snow flower of sword-light continued to hover
there in the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clink!
Ning once more returned his sword into the sheath on his back… and
with that, time seemed to return back to normal once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
twisted time?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
scene… it’s been forever burned into my memories.” The
cultivators of Houwu City were all shocked. That sword-strike had
been so beautiful! In addition, they had been able to see everything
with perfect clarity. The drawing of the sword, the chopping, the
flower of sword-light, the re-sheathing… it had all been clearly
visible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that it was extremely difficult to see the attacks
of Hegemons with clarity! And to be precise, it wasn’t that they
had really seen Ning’s attacks clearly; rather, Ning’s sword-arts
had emblazoned themselves into their memories, making it impossible
for them to forget any detail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The eight-armed giant fell down from the skies, landing on the ground
below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has a Sithe treasure on it!” Quite a few cultivators instantly grew
excited. Everyone could tell that those chains were quite
extraordinary… but none of them dared to go and take it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
A major power like him would never suffer insults lightly.” The
red-robed maiden couldn’t help but sigh as she watched from afar.
She had wanted to stop the giant, but failed. “They are fine when
calm, but when angered the end result shall be calamity. He had
always been an idiot, but how could he be such an idiot in front such
a major power?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how no one would dare to offend an Autarch, or even an
Autarch’s friends, family, and servants. There was no one who could
endure the consequences of enraging an Autarch! The red-robed maiden
could see that Daolord Darknorth was also someone who couldn’t be
offended by the likes of her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Eight-Armed Hill was simply too stupid. He deserved to die for
offending you, Daolord Darknorth,” the red-robed maiden said
hurriedly. “As for those cultivators the Ruler seeks to capture…
Daolord, what do you think?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way I can hand them over to you,” Ning said. “Go ahead and
tell the Blazesun Ruler that there’s no way I’ll hand them over.
That’s my bottom line! Anything else is negotiable, but if we
cannot come to an agreement and he insists on killing them… then
there’s nothing I can say or do. Your Ruler can come by himself or
bring his army; I, Darknorth, will be waiting for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed woman’s heart trembled. What a fierce thing to say. There
really were very few cultivators who would dare to say something like
this to the Blazesun Ruler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
inform the Ruler about this. I’ll be leaving now, then,” the
red-robed maiden said. As she spoke, she turned and immediately
departed alongside the remaining creatures under her command. No one
paid any attention to the eight-armed giant’s corpse, nor did they
dare to go pick up the Sithe weapon he had left behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
watched from afar as those creatures hurriedly departed into the
horizons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,”
Nuwa said, a hint of apology in her eyes, “Because of me, you…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’m someone who failed the Daomerge. Even if I’m extremely
careful, I only have a few thousand chaos cycles left. A few less
years won’t make any difference,” Ning said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what of the Blazesun Ruler?” Nuwa was worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
the Blazesun Ruler is a truly supreme Sourcewalker,” the nearby
Hegemon Goodsong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
slowly nodded. “The Blazesun Ruler’s power cannot be
underestimated. If we can avoid battle, that would be the best
solution. Everyone, make your preparations. This very day, we shall
depart from Houwu City!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
head out today.” Patriarch Treewind and Imperator Jade Rainbow had
come over as well, and they fully supported Ning’s decision.
Although they knew Daolord Darknorth was incredibly powerful, they
still felt a degree of fear towards the Blazesun Ruler! It was better
to avoid battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
very day, Ning led Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, and the others in
departing from Houwu City.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful on your journey, Daolord.” Lord Houwu watched from afar as
the realmship vanished from his demesnes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Governor, you were far too rash! If you had merely asked Daolord
Darknorth for some pointers, he would’ve agreed to give you some
guidance,” the nearby silver-browed elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Forget
it. That ship has already sailed. Just being able to witness that
dazzling sword-strike was all worth it,” Lord Houwu said. “That
sword-strike… I will probably never be able to forget it. It was
simply too incredible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
dazzling, snow-colored, flower-like sword had already surpassed the
limits of sword-arts. It truly was unsurpassably beautiful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Domain was a truly mysterious place. It was filled with many
Sithe treasuries, Sourcewalkers, Chaos Primordials, strange
creatures, and multiple otherverses. It was one of the most marvelous
places of the Chaosverse, one of the Eight Domains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The red-robed woman and the crimson bloodfiend leader flew through
the void side-by-side, finally landing upon a long walkway of frozen
ice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
a walkway of frozen ice to appear within the blazingly hot Blazesun
Domain was truly a marvelous thing. Thanks to its vast size, the
Blazesun Domain was a self-contained system unto itself that was
extremely stable, and filled with places that had both mud and water.
Ice, however, was still very rare, much less an entire walkway made
out of ice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
frozen walkway was semi-translucent and stretched off for countless
kilometers. It was lined with stone columns to each side, and each
column had a ball of fire blazing on top.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed maiden and the crimson bloodfiend leader walked across the
walkway of ice. After walking for a time, they saw an enormous altar
that had been sculpted out of ice. It had many layers of frozen steps
which led to a frozen throne at the very top.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Atop
the frozen throne sat a muscular man whose entire body was black. He
was dressed in black armor, and his eyes were two blazing balls of
fire. He rested his jaw on one hand as he stared downwards and said
calmly, “The Eight-Armed Hill’s lifestone has shattered, which
means it is dead. How did it die? I do not believe the Lord Governor
of Houwu City has the courage to launch a war against me! In
addition, I’ve never humiliated or made things too difficult for
their city. This time, they went too far in destroying something
which I loved.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
crimson bloodfiend leader shivered, not saying a word. The red-robed
maiden, however, bowed respectfully: “Ruler, we went on your orders
to apprehend those five cultivators. As you said, the Lord Governor
of Houwu City would never dare to make an enemy out of you… but
those five cultivators have a powerful backer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
backer?” The muscular black figure stared downwards at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The red-robed maiden said hurriedly, “Their backer is named Daolord
Darknorth!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord?” The muscular black figure was instantly astonished. In
truth, neither the red-robed maiden or the Blazesun Ruler had heard
the name ‘Daolord Darknorth’ before! Although the legend of Ning
had spread quite far by now, it had only spread amongst the
cultivators. No one would go out of their way to share news like this
to Sourcewalkers or the other civilizations! In addition, the
Sourcewalkers were located quite far away from each other; it was
generally quite hard for them to send word to their fellows. Thus,
there were very few Sourcewalkers who knew the legend of Daolord
Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you joking with me?” the Blazesun Ruler said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wouldn’t dare.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
would never dare to lie to you, Ruler!” the crimson bloodfiend said
hurriedly. “It truly was a Daolord, an extremely powerful one. He
didn’t even use any techniques at all; he simply manifested
countless streaks of sword-light in the world, and every single
streak of sword-light was capable of slaying Hegemons with ease! He
was utterly terrifying. I was completely dazed when I saw this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
He manifested countless streaks of sword-light, each of which could
slay Hegemons?” The Blazesun Ruler rose to his feet in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The red-robed maiden said hurriedly, “It should’ve been a domain
formed by the Dao of the Sword! A terrifying one at that. The
Eight-Armed Hill, that fool, actually thought that Daolord Darknorth
was just faking it and putting on a false front, insisting on
charging towards Daolord Darknorth and attacking him. I couldn’t
even stop him! Daolord Darknorth used just a single blow of his sword
to kill the Eight-Armed Hill. In addition, Daolord Darknorth is a
Daolord who has failed the Daomerge. I can sense that his soul and
truesoul were slowly dissipating with every passing breath.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler murmured softly, “I’ve never even heard of such a
terrifying Sword Dao domain. Can it be… a legendary ‘Eternal
Omega Dao’, one of the sword?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Daos were all legends. The Blazesun Ruler knew of them, but he also
knew that no one had ever succeeded in the Daomerge for an Omega Dao,
and that no one had ever mastered an Eternal Omega Dao! But when he
heard of how Ning had created such a terrifying Sword Dao domain, and
that Ning was a Daolord who had failed the Daomerge… save for the
Eternal Omega Sword Dao, the Blazesun Ruler couldn’t think of any
other possibility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Interesting.”
The Blazesun Ruler’s eyes lit up, and the flames that served for
his eyes suddenly glowed brighter. “A Daolord who has failed the
Daomerge but mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao? I’ve never heard
of such a thing. Finally, something interesting has appeared to break
up the monotony of life.”</P>

Chapter 20: A Strange Feeling</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Scarletbind.”
The Blazesun Ruler began to walk down from his altar of ice, his
blazing eyes burning brightly. He ordered in his sonorous voice,
“Come, accompany me to Houwu City. I can’t wait to meet this
Daolord Darknorth!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The red-robed woman immediately assented to the order.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sparring
against those other seven Domain Rulers is completely pointless.
Daolord Darknorth is a cultivator who has mastered the Eternal Omega
Sword Dao… the first in the entire Chaosverse!” The Blazesun
Ruler was filled with eagerness and a desire to do battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
stood at the very apex of power amongst Sourcewalkers. Each of the
Eight Domains had a Domain Ruler, and all of them were at the level
of the Sithe Exalts! There might be a few other supreme Sourcewalkers
located in other incredibly distant parts of the vast Chaosverse, but
there truly were very, very few of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
half a day later, the Blazesun Ruler reached Houwu City.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a black warship which was completely made out of deepfire blackstone
tore through spacetime and appeared in the skies above Houwu City.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
IS that?” The Hegemons, Emperors, and other cultivators of Houwu
City all stared in shock at the enormous black warship which had just
appeared in the distant skies. They felt a sense of pure terror from
the oppressive aura generated by this vessel. This was a powerful
warship which was similar to the Stone Hellephant Wall, and it was
the most powerful Sithe treasure which the Blazesun Ruler possessed.
This was far more powerful than a mere realmship!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the Blazesun Ruler.” Lord Houwu and a few of the more experienced
cultivators immediately recognized this ship, and they all flew into
the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The surface of the giant warship rippled as a door appeared, followed
by two figures flying out of it. The first was the red-robed maiden,
Walker Scarletbind, who had been here just a short while ago. The
other was undisputably the most terrifyingly powerful figure of the
entire Blazesun Domain… the Blazesun Ruler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Lord Houwu saw the muscular black-colored figure appear, he
immediately bowed respectfully: “Respectful greetings, Blazesun
Ruler.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Blazesun Ruler.” The cultivators felt shock and fear,
but on the surface they showed nothing but respect. They knew that
the Blazesun Ruler was on a completely different level of power than
them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
adventuring through the Chaosverse, they had occasionally battled
against Sourcewalkers and other marvelous creatures, but none of them
would dare to contend against the Blazesun Ruler! He was simply far
too powerful. Even dominating cultivators like the Lonely King or
Lord Houwu would have no choice but to bow their heads in his
presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler was comparable in power to that of the most supreme
Sithes. Even an Autarch wouldn’t be able to slay a Sithe Exalt with
just two or three full-power attacks. But of course, given enough
time they could still accomplish it; in the end, there was a degree
of difference in power between the Autarchs and the Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still…
to all other cultivators, the Blazesun Ruler was someone vastly
beyond their level. This was why the Blazesun Ruler himself generally
didn’t deign to battle against cultivators; at most, he would only
show his might against those foolish cultivators who had offended
him. In this case, Patriarch Treewind and Nuwa had barged into his
estate, completely wrecked it, looted it clean, and destroyed one of
his beloved items. Of course he would be angry, and of course he had
to make clear the weight of his displeasure!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth. Where is he?” The Blazesun Ruler stared downwards, his
voice booming out to shake the entire city of Houwu. As he spoke, he
scanned the city and searched it. Although he was able to find a few
Samsara Daolords, he wasn’t able to find one who had failed the
Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Domain
Ruler,” Lord Houwu said, bowing once more, “Daolord Darknorth
left Houwu City after defeating Scarletbind.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
left?” The Blazesun Ruler was startled. He shook his head and
murmured, “Can it be that he’s afraid of me? He’s the only
cultivator in the entire Chaosverse who has ever mastered an Eternal
Omega Dao… and he actually chose to flee instead of fighting? I
truly am disappointed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of the cultivators below him dared to say a thing. They were afraid
of Daolord Darknorth, but they were also afraid of the Blazesun
Ruler! In fact, they were even more afraid of the Blazesun Ruler,
because there was a limit to how long Daolord Darknorth would be
around for. Sooner or later, he would die and his Dao would vanish.
The Blazesun Ruler, in contrast, possessed an endless lifespan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
did Daolord Darknorth go?” the Blazesun Ruler growled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of us dared to ask,” Lord Houwu said hurriedly. “Daolord
Darknorth and the others left quite quickly. They could’ve gone
anywhere.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler laughed coldly. “This is my Blazesun Domain. They
won’t be able to escape it. Let’s go, Scarletbind.” The
Blazesun Ruler turned and walked back towards his black warship.
“Let’s go find this Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Domain Ruler.” The red-robed maiden immediately followed behind
obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant black warship left with a rumble. All of the cultivators below
finally let out sighs of relief. Even Lord Houwu still felt a hint of
lingering fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
the Domain Ruler didn’t make us the object of his ire. If he did,
we’d probably all have to run for our lives. Even though we have
the citadel protecting us, it’s likely that only a few of us would
make it,” the silver-browed elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth on one side, the Blazesun Ruler on the other. I cannot
afford to offend either one.” Moments later, a startled look
appeared on Lord Houwu’s face. “That’s odd. Why is it that the
Blazesun Ruler only asked about Daolord Darknorth and didn’t ask
about Nuwa and the others? It was Patriarch Treewind and Nuwa who
wrecked his estate. Logically speaking, his main target should be
Patriarch Treewind and Nuwa, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
The silver-browed elder was puzzled as well. “Can it be that he was
able to foresee that Nuwa’s group is travelling alongside Daolord
Darknorth? But I’ve never heard anyone say that he is particularly
accomplished in the Dao of Numerancy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
IS odd.” Lord Houwu was similarly puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
none of them realized was that by now, the Blazesun Ruler no longer
cared about Nuwa’s team at all. His ‘beloved item’ was nothing
more than a trinket he was fond of. What the Blazesun Ruler really
wanted to do was to find Daolord Darknorth and have a good fight with
him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler gave the order, fully mobilizing all of his forces to
begin a search for Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">More
than 300,000 years after Ning and Nuwa had first met.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A realmship was flying through a sea of fiery clouds. Inside the
realmship was the white-robed Ning and a silver-robed Nuwa, who were
having a conversation with each other. Nuwa was now dressed in longer
silver robes, and a red diamond was affixed to the middle of her
forehead. When the Lonely King had wielded these weapons, they had
emanated icy and evil auras, but on Nuwa they looked noble and
beautiful. The silver robes glowed with a holy aura that looked like
moonlight, while the red diamond put Nuwa’s alabaster-white skin on
full display.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
and Ning spent much of their time discussing the Dao. Ning held
nothing back, unstintingly sharing his own experiences in detail.
This caused Patriarch Treewind and the others to feel a sense of
tremendous jealousy! However, Ning occasionally provided them with a
few pointers as well… but he naturally didn’t put as much effort
into it as he did into teaching Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Treewind,
Jade Rainbow… based on my calculations, we should be arriving soon,
yes?” Ning suddenly asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,”
“Daolord,” Patriarch Treewind and Imperator Jade Rainbow answered
at the same time. After sharing a glance, Patriarch Treewind was the
one to answer: “We should arrive in just three more months. By
then, you’ll be able to see the imprisoned Sithe Exalt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled and nodded. The reason why Ning had been unwilling to meet the
Blazesun Ruler and spar against him was because the more he battled,
the faster his truesoul would dissipate. And yet, it would take
nearly half a million years to use a realmship to fly from Houwu City
to the outskirts of the Blazesun Domain. Given how much time even
this ‘fastest’ path would take, it was entirely possible that the
Blazesun Ruler would be able to intercept them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
Ning had chosen to take a roundabout path that would make it harder
for the Domain Ruler to find them. And since they had already chosen
to take a roundabout path, Ning decided to go ahead and pay a visit
to the imprisoned Sithe Exalt! Ning had never seen a Sithe Exalt
before and was quite curious about them. He also had the vague
feeling that there had to be a secret hidden behind the fact that the
six Sithe Exalts had been imprisoned in six of the Eight Domains at
the very center of the Chaosverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship continued to advance, occasionally encountering a few
creatures who Hegemon Goodsong or Flamewing quickly dispatched.
Another month went by in the blink of an eye as they drew closer and
closer to the imprisoned Sithe Exalt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”
Ning suddenly shouted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend, who was responsible for controlling the realmship,
immediately halted the ship and brought it out of its spacetime warp.
Everyone in the realmship turned to stare at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
what is it?” Flamewing was rather puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
ripples…” Ning closed his eyes, sensing as those faint ripples
washed over him. These ripples were constantly changing and
transforming, but on the surface they seemed quite ordinary. Given
how much fire elemental energy the Blazesun Domain held, for there to
be a few energy ripples was quite normal. “These ripples… in this
area, they’ve actually scattered apart into a total of over three
hundred million ripples, but they should all come from the same
source.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
murmured softly, “Vast, ancient, and powerful…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, Azurefiend, Goodsong, and other
Hegemonic figures were all puzzled. They could hear what Ning was
murmuring, but they didn’t sense anything at all.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_021__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 21: The Path to Becoming the Strongest Autarch</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Listen
to my commands.” Ji Ning opened his eyes, which were shining
brightly. He used his left hand to point towards a certain direction:
“Advance towards that direction.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Hegemon Azurefiend acknowledged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Domain was filled with too many dangers. Not even a
realmship could be used to engage in long-distance warps through
spacetime; at most, only short warps were possible. Sometimes,
ordinary flight was necessary as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this direction.” Ning’s finger suddenly moved to point a
different location. “Now over there.” Ning followed his senses,
and as they moved closer he continuously had them change directions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooooosh.
A strange but subtle sound, almost like the roaring of the waves of a
river, was beginning to pervade this entire region. Although everyone
within the realmship remained puzzled, the sound of the ‘roaring
river’ was enough to let them know that Ning was leading them to
some sort of secret place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
continually shifts through spacetime, moving from one continuum to
another. Its almost like a maze…” Ning smiled. “It’s hidden
quite well, but it still won’t be able to evade my senses.
Advance!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to point, guiding the realmship to fly up, left, down,
right… the direction constantly changed, and every so often they
would even warp into a different continuum. As time flowed on, the
echoing sound of the ‘river water’ began to grow increasingly
loud as well. Five months went by in the blink of an eye, and by now
the sound roared like thunder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The realmship suddenly rammed into an invisible barrier, which bulged
inwards. The realmship continued to press inwards, quickly piercing
through the invisible membrane. As it did so, the environment around
it completely changed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
in the…” The cultivators in the realmship were all stunned, as
was the Flamewing God. Su Youji’s eyes turned completely round with
shock. The calmest was Ning, but even he narrowed his eyes as he
stared at their new surroundings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were now in the midst of an enormous, fiery-red sea. If one took a
close look at the fiery liquid within the sea, one would see that it
was actually composed of incredibly dense and concentrated flames!
The countless flames all flowed together like a liquid, coming
together to form an indescribably vast sea. At the very center of
this sea was an enormous whirlpool that was continuously twisting and
churning, causing all of the fiery ‘liquid’ within the sea to
move and generate those rumbling roars. This was a sound that
surpassed the limits of spacetime and spread out in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
in the world IS this place?” Hegemon Azurefiend sighed with
astonishment. “This entire sea is composed of countless flames that
have been… liquefied? And the flames… I feel as though they are
on par with the flames which Flamewing belches out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yeah…
what is this place? How is it that a place like this can exist in the
Blazesun Domain? I’ve never even heard of it!” Patriarch Treewind
didn’t understand either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
like this place, Master! I want to dive right in.” Flamewing looked
excitedly at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead.” Ning smiled and nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Flamewing immediately exited the realmship and transformed into his
true form, then dove straight down towards the flaming sea. Even in
his true form, it was nothing more than a tiny little dot in the
great sea. Plop! It plunged into the flaming sea, kicking up some
‘spray’! As the ‘water’ shot up in Flamewing’s wake, it
quickly dissipated into flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whoah.
Whoaaaaah! This is nice! Ahahaha! This feels great!” Flamewing
delightedly swam through the flames, growling and howling happily,
“Master, come and try it out for yourself! It feels great! The last
time I felt this comfortable was when I was born.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all flew out of the realmship, then stood in the empty
void and stared at the great sea. “When it was first born?”
Ning’s face twitched. “Flamewing was born in the Quintessence of
the Chaosverse. That means that this place is actually quite similar
to the Quintessence? But there’s no way this place can be the
location of the prime essences.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
will was able to maintain constant contact with the prime essence of
the Dao of the Sword, and so he had a rough idea as to where the
prime essences were located. This place was not it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
an enormous amount of fire energy… I’ve never seen anything like
this,” Hegemon Goodsong mumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
my guess is correct,” Imperator Jade Rainbow said, “This place
should be the true nucleus of the Blazesun Domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
true core?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you saying that the entire Blazesun Domain in all its vastness…
originated from this place?” they all spoke out simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to scrutinize the place carefully. His gaze fell upon the
very center of the giant whirlpool, seeing through it as he scanned
the many traces and scars within. They actually brought Ning many new
insights, and he immediately said, “Jade Rainbow speaks the truth.
This place is indeed the wellspring of the Blazesun Domain! The
reason why the Blazesun Domain has such an enormous amount of energy
within it is because of this place. It all stems from here. Stay
here; I’m going to go take a look. No one is to disturb me.” As
he spoke, he flew straight towards the whirlpool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Master,” Su Youji called out with worry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
wait for me here. I’ll be fine.” Ning’s voice echoed in the
air, while he himself had already reached the area directly above the
giant whirlpool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The giant whirlpool was filled with limitless amounts of
power, and the rumbles emanating from it were especially loud here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
region around Ning began to be filled with his Sword Dao domain,
which served to protect him. It must be remembered that Ning’s
domain was able to slay even Hegemons with ease; to use it to repel
the ‘water’ of the whirlpool was quite easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
As Ning slowly descended, the Sword Dao domain ensured that the
liquid flames were repelled and pushed aside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
that’s how it is.” Ning slowly sank deeper into the whirlpool.
The region around him for three hundred meters was completely empty,
with the liquid flames unable to move into it. The deeper Ning sank,
the more stunned he felt as he saw how the giant whirlpool had been
formed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
fire in liquid form can possess such tremendous power…” The more
Ning saw, the more thoughts filled his mind. His Primaltwin had
temporarily returned to the Azureflower Estate, and was making use of
the Autarch’s stone dais to completely focus on understanding the
profound mysteries behind the whirlpool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
mere two days later, Ning had reached the Hegemonic level in the Dao
of Water!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was primarily because his Eternal Omega Sword Dao had propelled him
to simply incredible heights of insight. It was like a towering
skyscraper, allowing him to understand other Daos with far more ease.
In recent years, he had continuously improved in many other Daos.
This time, he was able to break through to the Hegemonic level in the
Dao of Water with just one ‘blow’. However… even though he had
reached the Hegemonic level, it still couldn’t compare to his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Domain is filled with the power of the element of fire. Who
would’ve thought that its wellspring is actually able to form a
liquid stream which holds so many secrets of the Dao of Water? The
way it has naturally formed has resulted in it completely merging the
secrets of the Dao of Fire and the Dao of Water into itself. There’s
no way to tell them apart.” Ning laughed, then his eyes suddenly
lit up: “Why do I have the sudden feeling that I can merge the Dao
of Water into my Sword Dao as well?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately sat down in the lotus position. His Sword Dao domain once
more spread out to three hundred meters, pushing aside the liquid
fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Ning had reached Hegemony in the Dao of Water, he suddenly had the
feeling that he was completely capable of infusing it into his Omega
Sword Dao. This was something which happened as a matter of course,
and as soon as he spent a bit of time meditating on it he immediately
knew why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So…
my path to Autarchy is actually different from that of the other
Autarchs.” Ning was stunned. For the first time, he understood how
he should break through to Autarchy. His lifespan was now limited,
which meant he probably wouldn’t have the chance to do it… but he
now knew what he should do!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
Hegemony to Autarchy… the paths which Autarch Bolin, Autarch
Awakener, and all other Autarchs had taken were identical. They had
first become Hegemons, then reached the Hegemonic level of
understanding in other Daos as well! After gaining enough insight
into Hegemonic Daos, they would finally and naturally break through
to become Autarchs. At that point in time, they would reach the
Daobirth level of ‘one Dao births many Daos’. It would naturally
form a ‘Daobirth Essence’ which was capable of forming the prime
essences of a universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Using
this ‘Daobirth Essence’, the Autarchs were able to create
alternate universes which would have prime essences that came from
the ‘Daobirth Essence’ which the Autarch had devised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
I’m different from them,” Ning murmured. “Autarch Bolin… for
him, his ‘one Dao’ which was the Dao of the Claw, while his ‘many
Daos’ referred to all other Daos. They came to form a ‘Daobirth
Essence’ which could also be referred to as a ‘Claw Daobirth
Essence’. As for Autarch Awakener, his Dao was the Dao of Wind. He
used it to reach the Daobirth level, and his ‘Daobirth Essence’
was the ‘Wind Daobirth Essence’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had received Autarch Awakener’s legacy and had seen the
Dao-guidance of Autarch Bolin. Thus, he knew that Autarchs were
strongest in their own specific Daos. Autarch Bolin’s had been that
of the ‘Claw Daobirth Essence’ as he was strongest in the Dao of
the Claw; his ‘many Daos’ were only at the Hegemonic level. As
for Autarch Awakener, he was most powerful in the Dao of the Wind,
whereas all his other Daos were merely at the Hegemonic level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
they were Hegemons, all the Hegemonic Daos they mastered were all on
equal footing. I, however, am different!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
took a deep breath. “My Eternal Omega Sword Dao is simply
overwhelmingly powerful. It far surpasses all other Daos, to the
point where Daos such as a Hegemonic Dao of Water can be infused into
it, making the Dao of Water part of my Eternal Omega Sword Dao! The
more Hegemonic Daos I infuse into my Eternal Omega Sword Dao, the
more massive and powerful it will become. After it accumulates
enough, it will then undergo a fundamental evolution and catapult to
a new level… an Autarch-level Omega Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally understood. If he became an Autarch, he would be an Omega Dao
Autarch, the most powerful of all Autarchs! Alas… Ning knew that
this would be an extremely difficult path to walk. The other Autarchs
‘only’ had to master multiple Hegemonic Daos, then gain an
epiphany and then break through. He not only needed to master those
Daos, he also needed to figure out how to fully infuse them into his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao! The process of infusion would be far more
difficult than merely mastering those Hegemonic Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he wanted to infuse those other Daos and then evolve his Eternal
Omega Dao, it would take time, luck, and many insights. The problem
was, his lifespan was extremely limited; he only had a few thousand
chaos cycles left. This wasn’t going to be even close to enough!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
I know how I can become an Autarch, I don’t have enough time. What
a pity.” Ning slowly shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll
first completely fuse the Dao of Water into my Eternal Omega Sword
Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately closed his eyes and focused all of his efforts into this
task.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on one day at a time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
long is Daolord Darknorth going to be training for?” Patriarch
Treewind stared at the wellspring of fire at the very center of that
giant flaming sea. There was an absolutely enormous vortex there, and
at the center of the vortex there was a white-robed figure seated in
the lotus position a few hundred meters deep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
I see it,” Imperator Jade Rainbow sent mentally, “Given that
Daolord Darknorth has failed the Daomerge and has a limited lifespan,
what’s the point of training? By now, he’s probably second to
only the Autarchs themselves in power. If I was Daolord Darknorth,
I’d spend the rest of my days wandering about and visiting all of
those places of legend. I’d especially want to visit the legendary
Sithe homelands. I’d definitely wander through that entire place.
After doing so, I would be able to die contentedly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
That’s why you aren’t Daolord Darknorth,” Patriarch Treewind
snickered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Imperator
Jade Rainbow was startled by this comment, but moments later he
nodded in agreement: “That’s true. He’s already failed his
Daomerge, but he’s still intoxicated by cultivation… no wonder he
was able to reach such heights.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Woohoo!
Master, this place is awesome! C’mon, let’s have fun together!”
The Flamewing God was happily rolling around in the sea of fire.
Every so often, it would swim over to Ning, but when it saw how Ning
was still meditating silently it didn’t dare to actually disturb
Ning. Instead, it turned to wander through the other parts of the
great sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend,
Hegemon Goodsong, Nuwa, Su Youji, and the others all watched this
marvelous scene from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
an awesome amount of power. If someone was able to take full control
over it, most likely not even an Autarch would be able to withstand
him,” Hegemon Goodsong said with a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way it can be controlled. That’s the natural energy of the
Chaosverse itself,” Su Youji said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
truly is formidable,” Nuwa praised. “He’s able to force the
‘water’ of the flaming sea to a distance of three hundred meters,
just by using his Sword Dao domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
three hundred meters is nothing,” Azurefiend said, “Nothing more
than a tiny little part of the entire flaming sea.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
also benefited from their observations, but only Ning was at a high
enough level of insight that he could understand the functioning and
the mysteries of this place, the wellspring of the Blazesun Domain.
Thanks to this place, it had taken him merely two days to improve his
mastery of the Dao of Water to the Hegemonic level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao of Water has now been infused into my Sword Dao. So this is the
result…” As Ning slowly gained a greater level of understanding,
his Sword Dao had become even vaster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
a Dao was to be described in physical size, then Ning’s Eternal
Omega Sword Dao had already reached an incredible height, the same
height which an Autarch’s Daobirth was at, but it was even purer.
Ning’s Dao was comparable to an Autarch’s Dao. The only problem
was, it was a bit inferior in terms of its ‘breadth’! Autarchs
had to upgrade multiple Daos to the Hegemonic level in order to reach
Autarchy; in comparison, Ning was lacking in this regard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
Ning was slowly infusing his Dao of Water into his Eternal Omega
Sword Dao, causing its ‘breadth’ to slowly improve as well.
Although its raw attack power didn’t increase by that much, it did
change in certain other areas! For example, Ning’s Dao of the Sword
was now as gentle as water, making it softer and more elastic when
defending. Most important of all, after Ning infused the Dao of Water
into his Eternal Omega Sword Dao, his Dao was even gentler in
nurturing his soul and truesoul, causing the disintegration process
to slow down by quite a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand now. As I slowly infuse more and more Daos into my Sword
Dao, it’ll change as well. It’ll become more lingering, more
dominating, have more vitality… or perhaps be able to pierce
through even greater amounts of spacetime…” Ning was slowly
comprehending the way forward. It would be hard for him to make his
Dao any ‘higher’, but he could continuously ‘broaden’ it. As
he made use of the mysteries of countless Daos, there would come the
day when he gained that moment of sudden insight… at which point,
he would undergo a final evolution and become an Omega Autarch! When
that happened, he would completely surpass all the other Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas…
Ning himself could tell that he would need an extremely long period
of time if he was to succeed. What he lacked most of all right now
was just that – time!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
I’ll fall, at least I’ll fall while trodding the path towards
Autarchy.” Ning didn’t feel the slightest bit dispirited. As he
continued upon his path, he would at least have the chance to see the
glorious light at the apex from afar. Even though he didn’t have
much time left, every extra step he managed to take would bring him a
sense of accomplishment and gratification.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Soon, Ning had spent over five hundred million years
training within the vortex at the center of the flaming sea. Nuwa and
the others, as cultivators, were naturally quite patient. None of
them, not even a Daolord like Su Youji, would care about a short
period of time like a mere half-billion years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” The Blazesun Ruler was seated atop the frozen throne on
the altar, narrowing his eyes pensively. Below him stood a total of
eight figures. These were his most important generals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Domain
Ruler,” a stooped and short figure spoke out brightly, “We’ve
laid down scouts in all of the likely locations throughout the entire
Blazesun Domain. So long as Daolord Darknorth is still here, we
should be able to find him. My guess is that he hasn’t left; he’s
still in the Blazesun Domain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we’ve already searched the entire Blazesun Domain. We’ve gone
everywhere there is to go and have questioned all the various races.
There are no traces of him at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Blazesun Domain is enormous. They might’ve fled into some
particularly remote region.” The various generals began to argue
and debate amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Shut
your mouths,” the Blazesun Ruler barked coldly. Everyone below fell
silent right away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
Daolord Darknorth truly have left?” A resentful look was in the
Blazesun Ruler’s eyes. He had been lonely for a very, very long
time. The only ones who could pose a challenge to him were the Sithe
Exalts and the cultivator Autarchs! Alas, the Sithe Exalts had all
been imprisoned and weren’t available for sparring, while the
Autarchs were completely transcendent. There was no way to find an
Autarch who didn’t go out of his way to reveal himself… and even
if the Blazesun Ruler did manage to find an Autarch, he would never
dare to issue a challenge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is one last possibility.” The Blazesun Ruler’s eyes suddenly lit
up. “Could he have gone there?” Even the Blazesun Ruler himself
had only discovered that place thanks to a lucky coincidence. Every
so often, he would go there by himself and train. He felt certain
that he was the only person in the entire Blazesun Domain who had
ever discovered it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is someone who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao. He might
actually have discovered it as well. I’ll go take a look.” The
Blazesun Ruler’s eyes lit up as he said, “I’ll go take a look.”
He suddenly rose to his feet, then entered his vast black warship by
himself and quickly departed, with all of his subordinates watching.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler spent a total of three years as he passed through all
the various obstacles. Finally, he arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a giant black warship suddenly pierced through a distant membrane and
appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that?” Nuwa, Patriarch Treewind, Azurefiend, Su Youji, and the
other cultivators were either silently meditating or chatting and
laughing as they waited for Ning next to the realmship. They could
all sense an enormous disturbance and couldn’t help but turn to
stare into the skies. There, they saw that enormous warship appear,
radiating that aura of terrifying power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
and the others all jumped to their feet. “Not good!” Patriarch
Treewind’s face turned ashen. “That’s the Blazesun Ruler’s
warship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!!!”
A deep, sonorous laugh rang out like the waves of the ocean, shaking
every inch of the vast sea of flames, right down to its very depths.
“I knew that Daolord Darknorth had to be hiding here! Hahaha… as
I thought, Daolord Darknorth truly lives up to his reputation. He
actually found the Wellspring Sea.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the laughter echoed throughout the area, the surface of the giant
warship flowed apart to reveal an opening. A muscular, black-skinned
man came flying out through the opening. The aura emanating from this
man caused everyone present to feel a sense of fear. All of the
cultivators trembled. None of them would be able to resist him; the
only result would be a slaughter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the Blazesun Ruler.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
caught up to us!” Imperator Jade Rainbow’s face was completely
ashen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The Flamewing God, which had been swimming within the sea of fire,
suddenly soared into the skies, its wings spread and its entire body
bathed in flames. Its scales stood up straight like the hair on a cat
as it stared intently at the black-skinned man. Although the
Flamewing God’s body was much larger, it was clearly in a state of
maximum wariness right now. It could sense that the black-skinned man
standing before it was a danger to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
feeling was much like when it had faced that Sithe Exalt! Perhaps
Flamewing would be able to keep itself safe thanks to its
indestructible body, but if it actually tried to fight this man then
it would be completely dominated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordial, eh?” The black-skinned man glanced towards Flamewing, a
smile playing at the corners of his lips. “Chaos Primordials who
like fire are quite rare. Young fellow, you should join me after I
dispose of your master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
your dreams,” Flamewing howled, but it didn’t dare to attack. It
knew that if it did, it would be utterly dominated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-skinned man couldn’t even bother to glance at the others. His
attention was fully focused on the white-robed figure that lay hidden
deep within that giant vortex. His grin grew wider. He truly had
picked the perfect opponent; the man was able to force away the
flaming waters of the sea merely through a Sword Dao domain!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_39_Chapter_023__Nuwa"></A>
Chapter 23: Ji Ning and the Blazesun Ruler</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, get your ass out here!!!” the black-skinned man shouted
loudly. BOOM! A ripple that could be seen with the naked eye suddenly
swept out and blasted at the distant vortex. This scene caused
Patriarch Treewind, Nuwa, and the others to all feel shock – the
man was far too powerful!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Without
question, Chaos Primordials and Sourcewalkers were the most favored
children of the prime essences of the Chaosverse. Chaos Primordials
were born with bodies that were unfathomably stronger than the bodies
of the Golden Emperors of the Sithe, and they had more energy
reserves than entire realmverses. If a Chaos Primordial managed to
somehow train to the Hegemonic level, it would probably be stronger
than even the Sithe Exalts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Sourcewalkers, although they had weaker bodies and energy levels
than Chaos Primordials, they were still far superior to cultivators
in both respects! Even the weakest of Sourcewalkers who never trained
at all would still be at the Hegemonic level of power, a testament to
their might. Just a bit of effort and they would become comparable to
Otherverse Lords in might… and if they managed to upgrade their
insights into the Hegemonic level, then they would have the power of
Sithe Exalts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
both Sourcewalkers and Chaos Primordials were extremely, extremely
few in number. Thus, the entire race of Sourcewalkers ‘only’ had
around ten or so members who were at the Sithe Exalt level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everything
in the Chaosverse was fair. Cultivators were blessed with far fewer
gifts, but the most dazzling cultivators had absolutely incredible
powers of insight and comprehension, such as Ning and the Autarchs.
In fact, even the likes of God Emperor Helong or Nuwa vastly
surpassed all Sourcewalkers in terms of comprehension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The vortex of liquefied fire suddenly exploded as the wave of power
slammed into Ji Ning’s Sword Dao domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
white-robed youth with a black scabbard on his back came rising from
the sea. He walked through the empty air until he reached a high
point in the skies, then turned and stared at the muscular
black-skinned man aboard the distant black warship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Blazesun
Ruler.” Ning had a smile on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
the hell were you running?” The Blazesun Ruler was palpitating with
malevolence, and the two fiery globes that served as his eyes glowed
with dazzling light. “I can’t believe you actually hid here for
so long.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was intrigued and drawn here by the Wellspring Sea,” Ning said with
a laugh. “As for wishing to avoid battle? I’m a Daolord who has
failed the Daomerge. When I fight, I’m using up my own lifespan. I
naturally wish to avoid combat when possible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
not for you to decide.” The Blazesun Ruler stretched out with his
right hand, causing a giant fiery axe to appear within it. The axe’s
surface actually glimmered with scorching black flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
impressed, Blazesun Ruler. This axe looks quite extraordinary.”
Ning then glanced at the giant black warship. “I once saw another
warship which was also completely covered with deepfire blackstone.
That warship was named the Tigerhill, but it was already ruined.
Domain Ruler, your warship seems quite similar to it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can jabber as much as you like, but you aren’t going to be able to
avoid this battle.” The Blazesun Ruler was filled with the desire
to do battle, and flames were beginning to actually fly out of his
eyes. “Die, Daolord Darknorth!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
his life, the one thing he loved the most was to engage in
exhilarating battles against other apex experts! Alas, ever since he
had become the Blazesun Ruler he had never again experienced such a
battle. Today, however, he was going to get exactly what he wanted.
He even shouted out the word ‘die’ because Daolord Darknorth
would only fight with full power when his own life was on the line.
That was the type of battle which would get the Blazesun Ruler’s
blood pumping! A mere sparring match would be completely meaningless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning could sense the murderous intent raging within his opponent.
Ning couldn’t help but frown: “Blazesun Ruler…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cut
the crap. Fight or die!” The Blazesun Ruler could no longer hold
back, and he immediately charged straight towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
guess that’s that.” Ning truly didn’t want to fight and waste
his remaining lifespan here. It just wasn’t worth it; the Blazesun
Ruler was overwhelmingly powerful, and there was no way Ning could
simply dispose of him in just one or two attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are forcing my hand, you battle-crazed maniac. Very well, then. I’ll
teach you a lesson.” Ning reached out with his right hand, drawing
forth a Northbow sword from the sheath on his back. There was no way
he would use all six swords at the same time… because that would
use up his lifespan even faster!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fight!”
The Blazesun Ruler charged through the skies, leaving behind a
fiery-red streak behind him. He raised his axe up high, transforming
it into an arc of flaming energy that seemed capable of chopping
anything apart. The axe was a savage weapon by nature, and the
Blazesun Ruler’s mastery over the Dao of Fire made it even more
explosive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
truly is blessed with an incredible body and natural talents. He’s
merely at the Hegemonic level of insight, but he’s able to unleash
an utterly terrifying level of power,” Ning murmured softly as he
lifted his Northbow sword up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
countless streaks of sword-light spread out in every direction. This
was his Sword Dao domain! The sword-light from his Sword Dao domain
was able to kill Hegemons with ease. Its power was so great that it
was on par with an Otherverse Lord’s full-force attack! Under
Ning’s control, the flood of sword-light moved to bar the Blazesun
Ruler’s path, serving as layers of obstacles that continuously
stabbed at every part of his body, disrupting his movements and the
mysteries behind his axe-attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
axe-attack was clearly a powerful one, but with Ning’s Sword Dao
domain continuously disrupting the Blazesun Ruler’s movements the
axe turned sluggish. The mysteries behind its movements were
disrupted, causing its power to lessen dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mediocre
insights.” Ning shook his head. If this person was a cultivator,
Ning would be able to slay him with a single strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
Daolord Darknorth! Your Sword Dao domain is truly powerful, and your
sword-arts are truly marvelous. You were able to disrupt my technique
with ease. I once battled against a Sithe Exalt during the Dawn War,
but not even he was as tough as you.” The Blazesun Ruler stared at
Ning. “But I have yet to unleash my full power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blazesun Ruler let out a furious roar, his body beginning to be
covered with flames. At the same time, the black armor covering his
body began to flow like water, transforming to cover every single
inch of his body. As for the fiery axe in his hands, the runes on the
surface of the axe-handle suddenly lit up as flaming light appeared
on the axe-edge. The power of this axe was rising to a level which
caused even Ning to feel a hint of danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
THIS is my full power. DIE!” The Blazesun Ruler, covered by that
black liquid armor, went completely berserk as he charged forwards,
using his giant axe to carve a path through the Sword Dao domain. The
domain was now no longer able to affect him at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
brutish. Now this is the definition of the ‘brute-force method’,”
Ning murmured softly. He took a single step forwards. Whoosh! He
instantly warped through space and appeared right in front of the
Blazesun Ruler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fast!” The Blazesun Ruler was shocked. Ning was simply far too
fast; this was an enormous advantage which Ning had thanks to his
overwhelmingly superior level of insight into the Dao! “But fast
alone is useless.” The Blazesun Ruler immediately chopped downwards
with his giant axe with tremendous power. He felt confident that even
if his opponent was the Sithe Exalt he had battled so long ago during
the Dawn War, the only choice would be to use a ‘soft’ technique
to ablate the power of his strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, just waved his sword. His strike seemed quite ordinary, but
it was bizarrely fast, so fast that the Blazesun Ruler’s giant axe
was completely unable to block it. Ning’s sword slammed directly
against the Blazesun Ruler’s body… and in that instant, the power
of Ning’s sword suddenly erupted. In this instant, Ning’s sword
became the most dazzling thing in this entire realm, and his
sword-light blazed with a light that shone thousands of times
brighter than the giant axe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
THIS was Ning’s full-power strike!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">SLASH!
The sword pierced straight through the layer of liquid black armor
and cut deep into the Blazesun Ruler’s body, piercing all the way
through and coming out from his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an impressive ‘invulnerable form’.” The power of this
sword-strike was causing enormous internal destruction to the
Blazesun Ruler’s vital energy, but Ning could sense that the
Blazesun Ruler’s ‘invulnerable flameform’ was resisting it
fiercely. The power of Ning’s strike was used up after merely
destroying 5% of the Blazesun Ruler’s truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
had been a full-strength strike from Ning! If Ning wanted to actually
kill the Blazesun Ruler, it would take him twenty such attacks… but
if the Blazesun Ruler had other protective abilities up his sleeve,
it might take fifty attacks or even more. The black warship was a
good example; Ning had the vague feeling that it was powerful enough
to completely disrupt the tempo of this battle. If it was factored
in, it would probably take Ning more than a hundred strikes in order
to kill the Blazesun Ruler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that this would not be a hundred ordinary strikes;
this would be a hundred full-force strikes! That could well cost Ning
nearly half of his life force… and if his opponent was more
difficult to deal with than anticipated, Ning could actually die from
this fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-what…”
as the Blazesun Ruler’s body was chopped through, his body
transformed into fire and furiously strove to defend. He was at the
Hegemonic level of insight, after all; his body was incredibly tough
and he possessed a formidable invulnerable form which made it so that
even the Sithe Exalt he fought had been unable to injure him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
managed to injure me heavily with just one strike!” The Blazesun
Ruler’s face was completely ashen. If a single strike could wipe
out 5% of his truesoul… this was terrifying. This was his truesoul!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
even the supremely exalted Autarchs would be able to kill him with
just one or two strikes. It would take the Autarchs a somewhat
extended battle in order to kill him. It was likely that they weren’t
much more powerful than this Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, his guess was spot-on. In terms of profundity, the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao was on par with the Daobirths of the Autarchs; the
only difference was that the Eternal Omega Sword Dao wasn’t quite
as ‘broad’. However, Ning was currently wielding what could be
described as the number-one offensive treasure of the entire
Chaosverse, the Northbow swords. This meant that his full-force
attack was indeed on par with an Autarch’s attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee.
Flee!” All other thoughts fled from the Blazesun Ruler’s mind as
he immediately turned tail and fled. What he wanted was a fun and
exciting battle, not to be massacred and killed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The Blazesun Ruler quickly fled into his black warship, then
immediately sent it tearing through the membrane surrounding
Wellspring Sea and fleeing far away. Ning didn’t move to stop him,
just watching as he fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
are you really going to let him run away like that?” The Flamewing
God finally regained his usual aura of bravado. “You should’ve
just killed him and taken his warship away. That thing looks better
than our realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
leave as well,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave?”
Nuwa, Su Youji, and the others all flew over. Su Youji asked in
confusion, “Why do we have to leave?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I really wanted to kill him, it’d probably cost me half of my own
life,” Ning said. “Let’s hurry up and leave. I scared him off
with that attack, but he’ll quickly realize that I won’t be able
to kill him that easily. He might even go and invite four or five of
the other Domain Rulers to come with him. If that happens, we’ll be
in trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Su
Youji and Flamewing had been feeling excited, but now they came back
to their senses. They remembered that their master was a Daolord who
had failed the Daomerge; each strike he used was consuming his own
life force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning immediately led them into the realmship and hurriedly
left the Wellspring Sea.</P>
