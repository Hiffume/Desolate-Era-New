Chapter 1 - New Raindragon Guards
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The winding Crimson
Dragon Mountains stretched off into the endless horizons. Even
Immortal cultivators couldn’t see to the end of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop one of its peaks,
an enormous teleportation array began to glow with light. Whoooosh!
Ji Ning and the rest of the fifty two suddenly appeared within the
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was fast.”
Ning glanced at his surroundings. Although he had already used the
array once, the speed at which it transported a person still caused
him to sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait here. Soon, the
Raindragon Guards will send people to welcome you,” said a
red-faced old man in a high voice. He was one of the ten plainly
dressed elders who were located around the array and guarded it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group thus
obediently walked out of the array, waiting next to it quietly. Very
soon, a large, wide ship swooped down from the distant clouds,
causing waves of air to emanate from around it as it landed atop the
peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An incomparably
ravishing pink-dressed maiden flew down from this large ship. Behind
her was a group of similarly alluring women. For a moment, it was as
though a host of fairies had descended into the mortal world. And
then, the spirit-beasts flew down as well, each of which immediately
moved towards the cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White!” Ning
instantly recognized the Whitewater Hound, who was also amidst the
group of spirit-beasts. The Whitewater Hound had a look of surprise
and delight his eyes. Over the past three months, he had grown
increasingly concerned. When the master of a spirit-beast died, the
spirit-beast would regain its freedom, and they would sense when that
occurred. Over the past period of time, spirit-beasts would often
depart and fly away, and as one after another left, the spirit-beasts
who remained began to understand that quite a few cultivators had
died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” Uncle
White looked towards Ning. Suddenly, he saw the head of the little
azure snake, wrapped around Ning’s wrist. He couldn’t help but
say in surprise, “Ning, son, this snake is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an Azure
Skysnake,” Ning sent mentally to him. “She’s that Azure
Skysnake who I battled in the past, when I adventured through
Eastmount Marsh. This time, we were lucky enough to meet yet again in
the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, and it can be said that we
experienced a life-and-death event together. Perhaps because I saved
her, she voluntarily offered to become my spirit-beast. And so…that’s
how it happened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
nodded gently. He looked towards the Azure Skysnake with friendliness
in his eyes while mentally saying to Ning, “Azure Skysnakes will
often discover some treasure sites, and they have astonishing
potential for growth. They are indeed quite suited for you, Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are ‘Uncle
White’?” Qingqing sent to him. The Whitewater Hound looked at
her, amusement in his eyes. “You were good brothers with Ji Ning’s
father, right? I heard that you are from Swallow Mountain as well. So
am I. It can be said that we share the same hometown. Myself, Master,
and you, Uncle White…we can be described as the Three Heroes of
Swallow Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning and the
other cultivators were chatting with their spirit-beasts, the group
of beautiful, alluring women stared with curiosity towards them.
Their leader, the pink-robed woman, waited for a short while, then
finally said, “Everyone…” The fifty two all looked towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, let me
congratulate you all for having survived. You may address me as
‘Daoist Yulan’.” Her flesh beneath the pink robe seemed both
visible and hidden, and her voice was even more irresistibly
charismatic. Ning’s retainer, Cloudjade, could be described as
possessing innate beauty and seductiveness, but the charisma of this
woman clearly came from some technique or some secret art which she
had trained in. But her allure was even more powerful! In addition,
she was a Primal Daoist; this made it so that even Wanxiang Adepts
were susceptible to their Dao-hearts being affected by her charm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each of you, please
produce your corpses of Wanxiang Diremonsters for my inspection. I’ll
review them, one by one.” Daoist Yulan looked at each of them, her
eyes filled with a seductive, alluring look. “For those who have
not acquired Wanxiang Diremonster corpses, you should stand forward
now, so as to help save me some time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, seven
figures walked out. As for Ning and the rest, they produced Wanxiang
Diremonster corpses for inspection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Diremonster bodies were
innately different from human bodies. Humans bodies were, by nature,
weak; unless they trained as Fiendgods, their bodies would be
incredibly fragile. Diremonsters, however, were different; many of
them possessed certain innate abilities that granted them mighty
physical strength. Although they were far from being a match for
Fiendgods, they could be considered as standing somewhere between
humans and Fiendgods. Many monstrous races would even transform some
of the deadlier parts of their bodies into intrinsic magic treasures;
from this, one could see how extraordinary their bodies were. This
was why it was quite easy to tell, from a corpse, if a monster had
been of the Wanxiang level or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daoist Yulan
spread out her divine sense, instantly sending it into the heads of
each Diremonster corpse. After but a single breath, Daoist Yulan
nodded gently. “Very good. They’ve all reached the Wanxiang
Diremonster level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of you,
stay over here. Later, someone will come to arrange for you to
leave.” Daoist Yulan looked at the seven rather haggard-looking
figures, then turned her gaze to Ning’s group. “As for the forty
five of you, take your spirit-beasts and bring them aboard my ship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, the
incomparably alluring Daoist Yulan led Ning’s group aboard her
ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daoist
Yulan…jeeze…” Ning’s forehead had a faint sheen of sweat, and
he even felt a faint fire begin to stir in his loins. In the past,
Ning hadn’t been moved by even bewitching figures like Cloudjade or
Ninelotus. However, the allure of this Daoist Yulan clearly stemmed
from some technique or art which she had trained in. How could the
mesmerizing technique of a Primal Daoist be so easily shrugged off?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Mu
Northson’s face was completely flushed. In fact, some of the
Wanxiang Adepts even had bloodshot eyes by now. However, their
tempered Dao-hearts allowed them to maintain their calm, in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daoist Yulan?
She swept them with a gaze, then let out a soft laugh. This gaze…this
laugh…instantly, quite a few Wanxiang Adepts closed their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doombringer, what a
doombringer,” Ning murmured silently to himself. “No wonder, in
my previous life on Earth, there were so many historical records of
cases where beautiful women brought doom and destruction to entire
nations. These Wanxiang Adepts all have sturdy Dao-hearts, and yet
they are all so drawn to her…if she were to go charm a mortal
Emperor, she would easily be able to cause that Emperor to no longer
care for his empire, and only care for her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ship continued to
fly through the clouds. Daoist Yulan waved her hands, and one book
after another began to fly towards Ning and the rest of the forty
five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations to
you forty five for having become new Raindragon Guards!” Daoist
Yulan continued, “Now that you have become Raindragon Guards, you
have gained some of the special privileges belonging to the
Raindragon Guard. At the same time, you also have some duties and
responsibilities to the Raindragon Guard. Take a close look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
began to flip through the books. As he did, Ning secretly sighed in
amazement. “The Raindragon Guard truly lives up to its reputation.
This book’s description of the special powers they possess…the
Raindragon Guard truly is incomparably overbearing and dominating!
Its Immortal cultivators cloak themselves in imperial authority, and
can all but act with impunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northmont clan of
Stillwater could only act as they pleased in Stillwater Commandery,
but Raindragon Guards could do the same in virtually any commandery
in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Responsibilities?”
Ning gave them a quick glance. They were fairly simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One-clawed Raindragon
Guards - Every ten years, they had to complete a mission worth a
single karmic point (these were the most ordinary of missions).
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two-clawed Raindragon
Guards - Every hundred years, they had to complete missions worth a
total of a hundred karmic points (the value of a normal two-clawed
mission).
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three-clawed Raindragon
Guards - Every thousand years, they had to complete missions worth a
total of ten thousand karmic points (the value of a normal
three-clawed mission).
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four-clawed Raindragon
Guards - Every ten thousand years, they had to complete missions
worth a total of a million karmic points (the value of a normal
four-clawed mission).
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five-clawed Raindragon
Guards - These were the highest ranking members of the Raindragon
Guard. They were able to mobilize the armies of the Raindragon Guard,
and were comparable to a Marquis in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The book described the
basic requirements and responsibilities of Raindragon Guards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Wanxiang Adepts
like Ji Ning, carrying out one mission every ten years was enough.
For example, if you carried out a minor mission like killing Bei
Zishan, upon completion, the Raindragon Guard would no longer bother
you for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some Loose Immortals
would spend thousands or tens of thousands of years between carrying
out missions. By comparison, their lives were fairly relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t so
bad.” Northson sent to Ning, “Senior apprentice-brother, being a
Raindragon Guard isn’t that hard. Based on what this says…we can
just go ahead and carry out a ‘ten karma’ mission. After doing
so, we can relax for a century.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can relax, yes,
but in doing so, we won’t be able to acquire any secret arts,
divine abilities, or magic treasures,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Northson
immediately flipped through a few more pages, then stared. “Whaaat?
Divine abilities and secret arts require the exchange of karma
points? And also have requirements in terms of rank?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many divine abilities
could only be acquired by two-clawed or three-clawed Raindragon
Guards. However, there was one exception; if one became a Keeper of
the Raindragon Guards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done reading?”
Daoist Yulan swept her gaze towards this new class of Raindragon
Guards. “It can be said that we Raindragon Guards have the most
plentiful number of secret arts and divine abilities in this entire
world. Even the Northmont clan of Stillwater cannot compare with us
in this regard, because we are the most powerful force of the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, these many
divine abilities and precious treasures cannot be casually granted to
you. After all…it wouldn’t be quite fair or equitable for all of
you to simply have to do one mission, then relax for centuries and
gain access to all these things.” Daoist Yulan continued, “Thus,
you have two choices. The first is to just train slowly; after you
become two-clawed or three-clawed Raindragon Guards, you’ll slowly
gain chances to acquire divine abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and everyone else
nodded. Two-clawed Raindragon Guards were comparable to ordinary
Primal Daoists in power; Bloodshadow was one such example.
Three-clawed Raindragon Guards, however, were probably comparable to
Loose Immortals. To wait that long to train…would probably be too
late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second choice is
to become a member of the Keepers of the Raindragon Guard, the most
incomparably loyal soldiers of the Grand Xia Dynasty! If you do so,
the Raindragon Guard will naturally expend quite a bit of effort in
training you!” Daoist Yulan swept them with her gaze. “Think well
on this. Whether now, a year from now, ten years from now, or a
century from now…we will always welcome you to join us as Keepers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
understand quite well that ordinary Raindragon Guards were like
deputies or retainers! They were quite free, and they had some
special powers…but the Keepers of the Raindragon Guard essentially
made up the devoted armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, early on in
the history of the Raindragon Guard, every single Raindragon Guard
was mandated to be governed in the same manner Keepers were now
governed. However, Immortal cultivators, by their very nature,
pursued carefree, unbound lives! The more talented an Immortal
cultivator, the less they liked to be governed. Thus, if the rules
were too strict, the only result would be for many of the most
peerless, powerful, talented of cultivators to end up leaving the
Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the Raindragon
Guard, in order to be able to draw in many elites from around the
world, finally set up a stand-alone ‘Keepers’ organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, many lone
wanderers and solitary Loose Immortals who had been training in their
own private mountains all decided to join the Raindragon Guard. The
Raindragon Guard’s power and reputation instantly skyrocketed, and
they became the undisputed number one military force of the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty! There were many major powers who were secretly
members of the Raindragon Guard, and most likely, there were very few
people in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty who could enumerate them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew about all
of the old freaks and talented figures who lay hidden within the
Raindragon Guard. And today…Ning had become a member of the Guard
as well. Although, he was of course the most ordinary type; a
one-clawed Raindragon Guard.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others,
after having acquired a Raindragon Guard talisman, were guided by
Daoist Yulan towards a beautiful palace, filled with sculptures and
paintings. The palace was roughly three hundred meters high, and it
took up nearly three thousand meters in length.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our Dao
Repository,” Daoist Yulan said with a smile. “It holds countless
techniques, secret arts, and various skills. You can take a good
look; your spirit-beasts, however, cannot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, Little
Qing, wait for me outside.” Ning and Northson immediately followed
the others, entering this palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Repository of
the Raindragon Guard was simply too vast. “It’s far larger than
even the Dao Repository Palace of our Black-White College,”
Northson said with a sigh. “Yeah.” Ning stared about himself as
well as he walked forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are 360
different types of Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques? This, this
is…” A shocked shout rang out from afar. Upon hearing these
words, the faces of Ning and Northson changed as well. 360? Even the
Black-White College only had 28!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There actually are
Ki Refining techniques that allows one to reach the ‘Pure Yang’
level? A level which is above even Immortal-level Ki Refining
techniques?” Another shocked cry from afar. Upon hearing this, Ning
and Northson immediately ran over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an
incomparably, exquisitely carved crystalline table here, and atop it
were two books. The covers of the books had starry points of light
drifting atop them, and next to the books was a silver-haired youth.
The silver-haired youth had one of these starry books in his hands.
While reading through the book, he called out in shock, “It
actually requires anywhere from a thousand to fifteen hundred
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence to break through to the
Wanxiang level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it that
incredible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal-level Ki
Refining techniques generally only require four hundred to eight
hundred kilograms.” Quite a few people ran over, and some of them
moved quite quickly. Although Ning and Northson both saw those two
books on the table, they were instantly snatched up by the other new
Raindragon Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While reading through
it, the other new guards shook their heads and sighed in shock. “If
one trains in this Pure Yang-level technique, then one’s chances of
reaching the Void stage and becoming an Earth Immortal is several
times higher than if one uses an Immortal-level technique. The
sturdier one’s foundation is, the better!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the people
present had never even heard of Pure Yang techniques. They only knew
of four levels of techniques; Mortal-ranked, Earth-ranked,
Heaven-ranked, and Immortal-ranked; they hadn’t imagined that there
was an even more powerful, Pure Yang-rank. It must be understood that
not even the Black-White College, which had produced a Celestial
Immortal, had such a technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t
understand.” The smug voice of a fairly attractive green-robed
woman rang out. “Ki Refining techniques can be divided into
Mortal-ranked, Earth-ranked, Heaven-ranked, Immortal-ranked, and Pure
Yang-ranked techniques! However, generally speaking, even the most
supreme and most firmly established of organizations, such as the
Northmont clan of Stillwater and the other Marquisates, will only
have access to Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques. Only the likes
of the Raindragon Guard, the most powerful organization of the
entire, vast empire of the Grand Xia Dynasty, has a Pure Yang-ranked
technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even the
Stillwater clan of Northmont has one?” Ning mused silently to
himself, “Perhaps they do, but don’t dare make it public.”
After all, the many Marquisates of this vast world might possess
certain special powers and techniques, but they would all have to
hide them, for fear that the Grand Xia Dynasty would suspect them of
desiring to rebel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only Keepers of the
Raindragon Guard can train in this? And even Keepers have to have a
thousand karmic points before acquiring it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary Raindragon
Guards like us will never have the chance to learn it? I wanted to
switch to training in a Pure Yang-level technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, these people
flipped to the final pages regarding the Pure Yang-level techniques.
Instantly, they all began to curse and moan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a thought.
Swoosh! He moved directly towards the table containing the 360
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques, immediately beginning to flip
through them. The other new Raindragon Guards also seemed to have
thought of something, and they, too, came to flip through the books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keepers of the
Raindragon Guard need a hundred karmic points to learn this.
One-clawed Raindragon Guards need ten thousand karmic points to learn
this. Two-clawed Raindragon Guards need a hundred thousand karmic
points to learn this…” Ning flipped through the requirements,
then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end,
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques were still quite precious. For
ordinary Raindragon Guards to acquire ten thousand karmic points
required them to risk their lives repeatedly. They would probably
have to battle for dozens of years before accumulating enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cruel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s just
cruel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few cultivators
shook their heads. Ning shook his head as well. Originally, he had
wanted to switch to training in a water-attribute Pure Yang-ranked
technique, but unfortunately, all of those techniques were reserved
for the Keepers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite common for
one to change in techniques. For example, while he was at the Swallow
Mountain region, Ning had trained in the quite average [Water Element
Art], while after arriving at the Black-White College, he had
established his foundations with the [Flowing Watersource]. If he
then switched to training in an even-better Pure Yang
technique…although it wouldn’t be as good as if he had trained in
it from the very beginning, it would still be superb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…how
could the Raindragon Guard so easily allow this technique to be
learned by others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they arrived at
the second floor of the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s so hard to
learn divine abilities as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are 89 divine
abilities, but more than half are reserved strictly for Keepers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The requirements for
the Heavenly Transformation technique are the lowest…one-clawed
Raindragon Guards only need ten karmic points!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
flipped through one divine ability manual after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heavenly
Transformation], [Rainbowflame Evasion], [Moving Mountains,
Overturning Seas]…these techniques all caused Ning’s eyes to go
red wth lust. Each of them had different requirements. [Heavenly
Transformation] was naturally the easiest to learn, while the hardest
was a divine ability known as the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]; it required
one to be a Keeper, and also have accumulated ten million karmic
points!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten million?” Ning
was secretly speechless. He had heard of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]
long ago; this was a divine ability that only appeared in the
legends, and was a divine ability on par with the likes of [Houyi
Shooting the Suns]. He hadn’t expect to encounter it here, today.
Clearly, the roots of the Grand Xia Dynasty were incomparably deep,
for it to be able to produce such a legendary divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Torch Dragon’s
Eye]…it’s just here to draw people’s attention.” Ning shook
his head. “It requires one to be a Keeper; clearly, one has to be
completely loyal to the Grand Xia Dynasty. And it requires ten
million karmic points…this would be incomparably difficult for even
an Earth Immortal. Clearly, only truly powerful Fiendgod Body
Refiners could possibly fulfill these requirements! But would a major
power amongst the Fiendgod Body Refiners sell his life into the
service of the Grand Xia Dynasty, for the sake of a single divine
ability?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ning
also understood that this divine ability was definitely incomparably
powerful. “Still, compared to my [Starseizing Hand], it’s
probably still a bit weaker,” he mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing
Hand]…this was ranked amongst the top ten of the countless divine
abilities that had been developed since Pangu had established the
heavens. It wasn’t too realistic for the Grand Xia Dynasty to
acquire one of the top ten divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">360 types of
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques. Three Pure Yang-ranked. 89
divine abilities. 61 divine will techniques. 102 forbidden
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also a
number of other unique treasures as well as countless precious
materials. Although they were only recorded in books, the
requirements for acquiring them were all noted clearly…and since
they were all mentioned, given the Raindragon Guard’s resources,
they would surely be able to produce them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Immortal-ranked
magic treasures are available for trade. Immortal-ranked! I hear that
even many Immortals lack treasures of that rank. Unfortunately,
again, this requires one to be a Keeper, and one who has accumulated
tremendous sums of karmic points.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued to read
about what was available. Even Ji Ning and Mu Northson, disciples of
the Black-White College, the third most powerful organization in
Stillwater Commandery, felt moved and desirous. One could imagine how
ordinary new Raindragon Guards felt! All of them had itchy feelings
in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of the Dao
Repository…the Raindragon Guard truly was number one in the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, what have
you decided upon?” As Ning and the others walked out, Daoist Yulan,
seeing the unhappy looks on their faces, said to them, “If you join
the Keepers, then you will instantly soar to the heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest were
all quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not in a
rush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can request to
be admitted to join the Keepers at any time.” Adept Yulan shook her
head and said, “However, the later you join the Keepers of the
Raindragon Guard, the more training time you waste. Perhaps, because
of the time you wasted, you won’t be able to ascend to the highest
levels of your Immortal path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a short,
pudgy man strode out from the group. A fierce look I his eyes, he
said in a low voice, “I will join the Keepers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yulan instantly
laughed, her smile as beautiful as a flower’s. “Excellent. You
are the first of this batch!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - Seclusion Within the Black-White College
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To choose to roam the
world, carefree? Or to give that up in exchange for the chance to
acquire truly top-tier techniques and arts? Which was the better
choice? Since ancient days, there had never been a clear answer. As
for Ji Ning, since he had access to the divine abilities, secret
arts, and techniques of the Black-White College, he naturally wasn’t
too moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia
Dynasty has really used all means available to lure the Raindragon
Guards to become Keepers.” Ning sighed to himself. “Most
importantly of all, the Dynasty never forces anyone; it’s up to
everyone’s own decision! If you join the Keepers, you have no one
to blame but yourself. What a superb move!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” Daoist
Yulan’s voice rang out once more. “After having become Raindragon
Guards, your tribes will be blessed as well. Within the territory of
your tribes and clans, you can carve out a territory of ten thousand
square kilometers. So long as you are alive, this territory will be
protected by the Raindragon Guard! There will definitely be no one
who will dare to invade it! This includes the Marquis of Stillwater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Years
ago, when he was young and encountered Adept Mu Xiao, the Adept had
said the same thing to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you do die,
this land will still be protected for a thousand years.” Daoist
Yulan suddenly laughed, as beautifully as a blooming flower. “But
if you become Keepers, even if you die, your territory will still be
protected for ten thousand years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten thousand years?”
Ning was surprised. “Ten thousand years is enough time for the clan
to produce some truly powerful figures, if it focuses on doing so.
Ten thousand years of peace?” This hadn’t been recorded in any of
the books. Aside from a few people who already knew about this, most
of the new Raindragon Guards were still incomparably stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to join
the Keepers, you may do so at any time.” Daoist Yulan turned and
walked away. While doing so, she said, “Let’s go. Let’s go mark
out the territory of your clans.” They walked to an ancient hall,
where each of the new Raindragon Guards marked out their territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan. City of Ten
Thousand Swords.” Pen in hand, Ning lightly circled around an area
on the map, encompassing an area of ten thousand square kilometers
around the City of Ten Thousand Swords, with all of the four
prefecture cities just barely included within as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man in front of
the table nodded. Accepting the leather map from Ning, he rolled it
back up, then gave Ning a talisman. He said, “Take this and have
someone who is at least at the Zifu level bind it, then hang it at
the gates of the City of Ten Thousand Swords.” Ning accepted it,
then immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One person after
another entered, mapping out their chosen territory. Some lone
practitioners belonged to no clans, and so for now, they chose not to
draw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to join
the Keepers, you can do so at any time.” A lotus flower leaf
appeared beneath her feet, then lifted her up into the air. Her voice
resonated through the skies as she said, “Now, you can each go do
whatever you please. However, remember one thing; you are now
one-clawed Raindragon Guards. Every ten years, you must complete a
mission for at least one karmic point. This is your responsibility as
Raindragon Guards. If you aren’t able to complete this…you’ll
be apprehended and forced to carry out a mission. If you aren’t
able to carry it out, then you’ll be expelled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her voice echoed in the
air. As for Daoist Yulan herself, standing atop that lotus leaf, she
gracefully soared into the clouds, disappearing into the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what should we do now?” Northson asked. Ning
replied, “What can we do?” He shook his head. “Although this
division of the Raindragon Guard has a plentiful Dao Repository, one
has to use karmic points to trade for them. We don’t have any
karmic points at all…we need to hurry up and go accept some
missions. After doing so, the Raindragon Guard won’t bother us.
Let’s go accept the mission, then go back to Stillwater City and
sell off the items we acquired in the wild marshes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson laughed.
“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
little azure serpent was wrapped around Ning’s wrist, and the large
white dog was behind his back. By his side was his junior
apprentice-brother, Northson. The two of them went off to accept
missions, and then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back to Stillwater
City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, the
Whitewater Hound, and Qingqing were seated atop the dragon-headed
warship. They quickly soared into the skies and into the clouds.
“Senior apprentice-brother, this mission isn’t so hard,”
Northson said. “Honestly, we should’ve taken on twenty or thirty
karmic point missions. When the two of us join forces…it really
will be hard to find a Wanxiang Adept who is a match for us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be a bit humbler,”
Ning said with a smirk. “If we encounter the likes of senior
apprentice-brothers Bloodshadow, Holyfire, or Sloppy…will we be
able to overcome them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They, uh, they…”
Northson mouth opened and closed a few times. Honestly; they really
wouldn’t be able to. These were figures who had comprehended a
complete Dao Path and who were definitely comparable to Primal
Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Don’t
think that just because we killed a few Wanxiang Adepts and Wanxiang
Diremonsters that we are invincible. In addition, we’ve already
taken on two ‘ten karmic point’ missions. As long as we can
accomplish them, for the next century, we’ll be completely free.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. A hundred
years of freedom is good enough.” Northson nodded, then gritted his
teeth. “Before going to the military missions headquarters, I
really had no idea that this region had so many vile figures present.
There really are all sorts of vile men here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” A hint of
a killing intent appeared in Ning’s eyes as well. The military
missions headquarters had many missions, the vast majority of which
entailed killing some individuals who had committed extremely grave
sins. These sins had reached the point of causing the Dao of the
Heavens to cause sins to swirl about these sinners. By killing them,
the entire Grand Xia Dynasty’s fortunes would improve. Naturally,
the Dynasty would set up long-lasting mechanisms for ensuring this
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two…one
massacred countless mortals in order to train his ‘Demonic
Bloodhell Eye’. The other was actually able to cultivate a
‘Ghostfetus King’…I really don’t know how many infants he
killed.” Northson shook his head. “In addition, these are just
missions of ten karmic points. Those missions for tens or hundreds of
thousands of karmic points…they require that one go kill some truly
evil, terrifying, demonic figures which cause headaches to even the
Grand Xia Dynasty itself. Despite being surrounded by countless sins,
they are still capable of withstanding the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one embarked on
the proper path, one had to be able to comprehend the Dao, had to
refine one’s Dao-heart, and move one step at a time. On the deviant
paths, however, things moved much faster. Although they caused sins
to swirl around a person, making the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations to grow even more powerful…these deviant, evil paths
could also allow for one’s power to skyrocket, which would actually
make resisting the calamities and tribulations much easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the end,
although the evil paths could allow you to grow temporarily more
powerful, they were never long-lasting! When the time came for the
Celestial Tribulation, those who walked the righteous, orthodox path
had a chance to become Celestial Immortals; even if they failed, they
would become Loose Immortals. However, it was virtually impossible
for those on the vile, deviant paths to become Celestial Immortals,
and extremely few of them would even be able to become Loose
Immortals. This was because the Celestial Tribulation for
practitioners of the vile arts was simply too terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We reached
Stillwater City.” Northson glanced downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing.” Ning
glanced at the little azure snake on his wrist. “Your ancient
glacial ice…give me half of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The little azure snake
instantly transformed into mist, then reformed into an azure-robed
maiden. Her eyes were completely round, and she said furiously,
“That’s mine, Master! I worked extremely hard to acquire it!
You…you…you damn bandit, I completely misjudged you! That pure,
innocent youth of the past has actually become so vicious. You truly
have no…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth,”
Ning hurriedly barked. He took a deep breath, then said, “You damn
miser, you can’t possibly use up such an enormous piece of ancient
glacial ice. I’m going to help you sell it at the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain in exchange for liquefied elemental essence, so as
to help you increase in power. Understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing blinked, then
mumbled, “You better not skim any of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…come with me and
watch as I trade it for liquefied elemental essence. Is that
acceptable?” Ning was truly speechless. Little Qing was simply too
miserly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Here you go.”
Qingqing stretched her hand out. Whoosh. A chunk of ancient glacial
ice the size of a small mountain instantly appeared in front of her
hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Northson’s
mouth immediately hung open. He howled, “You little green snake,
you had so much ancient glacial ice, but you only gave me such a tiny
piece?! And to think I was so grateful towards you!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing didn’t even
give the bellowing Northson a single glance. With a wave of her hand,
she sent her elemental ki out, slicing through the iceberg of ancient
glacial ice, dividing it in two. She then stored half of it, giving
the other half to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship charged downwards, towards that enormous, ancient city of
Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After returning to
Stillwater City, Ning and Northson felt an instant sense of
familiarity and nostalgia; they had lived here for more than three
years, after all. After being inside the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
for an hour, Ning’s group re-emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yours.” Ning
handed a jade bottle to the nearby Qingqing. Qingqing accepted the
bottle, carefully inspecting its contents. There was exactly 2650
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence within; this was the exact
amount which Ning had acquired when selling off the ancient glacial
ice. Only now did she nod, satisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head and
laughed. Then he turned to Uncle White. “Uncle White, this is for
you.” When Ning looked at the human-formed white-robed,
white-haired Uncle White, who looked so similar to Ning’s own
father, he felt all the more warm and loving towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
walked over. After doing an inspection, he was shocked; there was
4000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence within this bottle. He
shook his head and sent mentally, “Ning, son, this amount of
liquefied elemental essence would raise your power dramatically.
There’s no need to waste it on me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have another 3000
kilograms here,” Ning sent back to him. “To me, an extra four
thousand kilograms won’t have much of an impact. I’ll probably
need tens of thousands of kilograms to reach the Primal Daoist stage.
In addition, according to the traditions of the Black-White College,
I must completely comprehend an entire Dao Path before I am permitted
to enter the Primal Daoist stage. I’m still quite far away from
being able to comprehend an entire Dao Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t of
great use to me, but to you, Uncle White, it will be very helpful.
Right now, Little Qing is a Wanxiang Diremonster. When you increase
your power, Uncle White, you’ll be able to better assist me,”
Ning sent mentally. The Whitewater Hound hesitated, but in the end,
he nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this trip to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain, Ning sold off almost all of the
treasures he had acquired in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains,
including Dong One’s protective treasure, as well as the treasures
of the Dragonwhale King. He even sold off the Dragonwhale King’s
intrinsic magic treasures for a high price; the intrinsic magic
treasures of a Primal Dragonwhale Diremonster, those two
dragon-whiskers, were far more valuable than ordinary Heaven-ranked
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson had
each acquired five thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.
Northson purchased quite a few construct ingredients, while Ning only
had a bottle of ‘firelotus pith’, which was necessary for
nourishing his goldflame earthfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back to
the Black-White College. Training back in the College will be very
safe; we won’t have to worry about being disturbed,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. What we need
to do is go into secluded meditation and get it all done at one go. I
should be able to train directly to the peak of the Wanxiang level,”
Northson said excitedly. “Senior apprentice-brother, you should be
able to reach the peak of the Wanxiang level as well, right?” He
had no idea that Ning had given four thousand kilograms to his Uncle
White; he thought that Ning still had five thousand kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
said, “Let’s go. Let’s go back and do some training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, the two
men and the two spirit-beasts began to walk towards the Black-White
College.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 - Disappointed and Confused
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired Immortal Diancai was seated in the lotus position atop
his jade bed. Suddenly, a hint of amusement appeared at the corner of
his lips. “Seems as though this kid was successful in joining the
Raindragon Guard. He came back quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ji Ning
and Mu Northson had just re-entered the Black-White College, flying
through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I’ll go find you tomorrow,” Northson said.
“Go back and focus on your training,” Ning said. “After you
finish, we’ll go take on more missions.” The two of them had
prepared well in advance; after absorbing enough liquefied elemental
essence and rising in power sufficiently, they would immediately go
and execute those vile, sin-laden cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Ning
moved forward on a small boat, while Northson rode his dragon-headed
warship. Each flew to their own little mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, senior
apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth returned? Last time, when I went to
visit you, I discovered that you had gone out to go adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the way back to
Darknorth Peak, Ning ran into six ordinary retainer-disciples and a
single formal disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s Darknorth
Peak.” Atop his flying ship, Ning stared downwards towards a
mountain peak. It was already sundown, and beneath the glow of the
setting sun, Darknorth Peak seemed so dreamlike and illusory. “Little
Qing, you are my spirit-beast, but in the Black-White College, there
are many forbidden areas which you cannot enter without permission.
Today, just be good and quietly train in a secluded room. Don’t go
anywhere else and don’t make trouble for me, understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master.” After entering the Black-White College, Qingqing was
extraordinarily excited. Ning couldn’t help but laugh, and then he
immediately sent his ship flying downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another emerged from the Darknorth Peak’s estate; it was the six
retainers Ning had left behind. Meng Roch, Cloudship, Cloudjade,
Forgard, Weifang, and Nethersun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” the six called out, welcoming him in
unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you came back already? Were you
successful in joining the Raindragon Guard?” Cloudjade looked at
Ning, her eyes shining brightly. As a naturally beautiful, alluring
maiden, she naturally attracted admirers like moths to the flame. She
had many pursuers, and even amongst Ning’s retainers, aside from
Meng Roch and her elder brother Cloudship, the other three were all
trying to woo her. Naturally, there were other retainers on other
mountains who were chasing after as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having grown
accustomed to the retainers, when she saw Ning, she instantly mused
to herself, “Compared to senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, all of
them are like clay pidgeons or earthen dogs! Hmph…even if the
Dao-Companion of myself, Cloudjade, isn’t as good as senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, he should be at least half as good as
him. These people aren’t even close to being comparable to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I joined the
Raindragon Guard,” Ning said with a smile. The six all said in
unison, “Congratulations, senior apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
pointed towards the azure-robed maiden by his side. “This is my
spirit-beast, Qingqing. You should get to know each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Qingqing.” Everyone, Cloudjade included, spoke
with great respect, because they could sense the powerful, monstrous
aura emanating from her. She was definitely a Wanxiang-level
Diremonster, while the six of them were all merely Zifu Disciples. In
truth, Qingqing had released her aura intentionally, wanting to
overawe them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, all of you
can leave now. Uncle White, arrange a private training room for
Qingqing,” Ning said, then went by himself to his own training
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as he comes
back, he goes into training. No wonder he’s so talented.”
Cloudjade looked at Ning, then nodded. “The Dao-Companion I find in
the future must be as hard-working as senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
training room. The ceilings glowed with light from the star-like
jewels, which bathed the entire room in their glow. Ning sat there
quietly in the lotus position, atop the carved jade bed in the center
of the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s begin.”
Ning waved his hand, and a jade bottle appeared. He placed it in
front of himself, then opened the stopper. This jade flask had three
thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence within, and as soon
as he opened the stopper, a thick, nourishing elemental aura drifted
out from with it. Just breathing in the air in this room made one
feel extremely comfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was
powerful, his talent was tremendous, and his foundation was very deep
and stable. His training speed was also astonishingly fast. Normally,
Wanxiang Adepts might spend centuries without building up enough
elemental ki to break through to the Primal Daoist level, but for
Ning, even if he just trained slowly, a few decades would be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Desspite that,
however…these three thousand kilograms would be the equivalent of
Ning engaging in painstaking training for six to ten years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb.” Ning
opened his mouth, and the liquefied elemental essence entered his
mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his Zifu region.
At the deepest depths of that sea of elemental ki, the Watersource
began to rapidly release large amounts of incomparably pure elemental
ki. The entire elemental sea began to swivel slightly, and the
surface of the sea naturally began to rise. At the same time,
countless grains of refined essence began to emerge within the sea of
elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…these
countless grains of refined essence rose into the skies. In the skies
of the Zifu Region, there were thousands of stars, a sun, and a moon.
These incomparably mysterious and profound stellar bodies were
beginning to slowly move as well, and as they did, the truly pure
‘Wanxiang-level elemental ki’ began to be generated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the countless
grains of refined essence were instantly swept into the orbits of
these stellar bodies as they soared into the skies. The countless
stellar bodies slowly moved about, grinding the grains and breaking
them apart, then absorbing the remains. Naturally, it was the sun and
the moon which absorbed the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not seeming tired at
all, the stellar bodies moved nonstop, each one exerting their own
attractive or repulsive forces. Suddenly, the gravitational forces
locked, and they were now unable to move an inch! These locked in
stellar bodies continued to absorb more and more grains of refined
essence. Upon reaching a certain size, they would undergo a
qualitative transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wanxiang-level
elemental ki from these stars was now clearly much more pure than
before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The middle-stage of
the Wanxiang-level,” Ning mused to himself. “After using up
nearly a thousand kilograms, I’ve reached the middle of the
Wanxiang-level. Let’s continue!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long period of time
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning used up
more than 1500 kilograms, and the countless stars within Ning’s
Zifu region began to undergo yet another qualitative transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The late
Wanxiang-level!” Ning opened his eyes, staring at the jade bottle
before him. The jade bottle had less than five hundred kilograms
left, but there was no way he could reach the peak with this amount.
Based on his previous experiences, from the late Wanxiang-level to
the peak Wanxiang-level would probably require 2000 to 2500 kilograms
of liquefied elemental essence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, the
hardest part is stil going to be going from the peak of the Wanxiang
stage to the Primal Daoist stage. That step will take tens of
thousands of kilograms,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Could it be that Ning
would go and ambush and kill other Wanxiang Daoists?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes, if
one always walks by the side of the river, eventually, one’s shoes
would get wet. Perhaps Ning would encounter a low-profile yet
incredibly powerful Wanxiang Adept, or one with a tremendously
powerful magic treasure. In that case, he truly would die! Thus,
generally speaking, unless there were special circumstances, one
wouldn’t go waylay and kill other Immortal cultivators. If one did
so repeatedly, one might be successful for a time, but sooner or
later, one would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. For now, in
terms of both comprehension as well as in the Dao of the Sword, I’m
not good enough yet. Breaking through to the Primal stage won’t be
for some time to come.” Ning once more began to ponder on his
swordplay and began to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed past, and
soon, it was light outside. It was dawn, and Northson had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-brother,” Northson called
out, appearing to be in uncommonly high spirits. ‘I went all the
way to the peak of the Wanxiang stage, and still have quite a bit of
liquefied elemental essence left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why so smug? I’m
at the peak of the Wanxiang level as well!” Qingqing stared at him.
Northson was shocked. “You? With just that little bit of liquefied
elemental essence? Previously, you were like me, at the middle of the
Wanxiang level; I used up far more liquefied elemental essence than
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing pursed her
lips. “I spent three hundred kilograms to reach the late Wanxiang
stage, then another 2250 to reach the peak of the Wanxiang stage.
Clearly, previously I was already quite close to the late Wanxiang
stage and was much stronger than you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there to the
side, sipping on some wine and laughing while the two bickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, how about you?” Northson sat down as well.
“Late Wanxiang level,” Ning said with a calm laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Late?” Northson
was shocked. “Why only late?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My son Ning and I
are both at the late Wanxiang stage now.” A white-haired,
white-robed man walked in through the gate. Northson, upon hearing
this, instantly understood. Ning must have given his liquefied
elemental essence to the Whitewater Hound, who had previously only
been at the peak of the Zifu level. Otherwise, how could the hound
have trained all the way to the late Wanxiang stage at one go?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White had an
extremely high level of comprehension with regards to the Dao of
formations. Thus, with enough liquefied elemental essence, he was
able to advance considerably. If one doesn’t have a sufficiently
high level of comprehension and a strong enough Dao-heart, even if
one has liquefied elemental essence, it won’t make a difference.”
Ning looked at Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother, are you going
to go visit your master? If you don’t, we’ll head out right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” Northson
said, shaking his head. “You didn’t go visit your master either,
right?” Ning nodded. They had just said their farewells last
time…it had only been three months. Ning hadn’t improved that
much in terms of swordplay, and so he didn’t need to be in a rush
to see his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s eat
breakfast, then head out,” Ning said. “All of you, sit down.
Uncle White, Little Qing, sit.” Northson, Qingqing, Uncle White,
and Ning all sat there, chatting, laughing, and eating. That very
day, after the sun fully rose, Ning’s group once more left the
Black-White College…and after this departure, it would be a long
time before they returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had encountered
quite a few people after returning to the Black-White College, and so
those who were interested in him naturally learned quite quickly that
he was back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Ninelotus
waved her hand, and a watery mirror appeared in front of her. She
stared at herself in front of the mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ninelotus
frowned slightly. The style of her blue robes began to change, and
even the embroidery of the robes began to change. As a set of magic
robes, it naturally could change in coloration. A short time later,
Ninelotus finally smiled. With a wave of her hand, she dismissed the
watery mirror in front of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A snowy white
lotus flower appeared. Ninelotus stepped onto the snowy white lotus
flower, then flew straight into the air, leaving her estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
Ninelotus, aboard the snowy white lotus flower, saw the distant
Darknorth Peak. After flying a bit closer, she finally spoke out: “I
heard that junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has returned. I wonder
if we can meet?” Her voice echoed in the air above Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a swarthy,
black-skinned man and an alluring woman appeared. It was Meng Roch
and Cloudjade. Roch hurriedly bowed. “Senior apprentice-sister
Ninelotus, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning returned yesterday, but
he left again this morning.” The nearby Cloudjade stared up at
Ninelotus, who stood upon her snowy white lotus flower. She felt as
though Ninelotus were a beautiful, Immortal fairy, and she couldn’t
help but feel envious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s gone?”
Ninelotus was stunned. “When will he be back?” She asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t know.”
Roch shook his head. “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning said that
this time, he probably wouldn’t be back for a long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A long time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus nodded
slowly, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. And then, still atop
her magic treasure, she departed, disappearing into the distant
horizons.
</P>

Chapter 5 - Never Forget
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning didn’t know
that Ninelotus had come to his place shortly after his departure. At
this moment in time, he was on a journey with his junior
apprentice-brother, Uncle White, and Qingqing to go apprehend some
criminals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the
intelligence reports provided by the Raindragon Guard, after roughly
a month or so wandering through various regions, Ning’s group
finally arrived at the location where an evil cultivator known as
Adept Blackhorn was hiding. This Adept Blackhorn relied on a
‘Ghostfetus King’ to do battle, and no one had ever been able to
overcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, this
time, he encountered Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, Uncle White
stealthily set down a formation, making it so that Adept Blackhorn
had nowhere to run. Next, Ning’s group revealed themselves. Ning
didn’t even fight; he let Mu Northson reveal his ‘Fiendish
Skyeater Serpents’ and use his constructs to grind the Ghostfetus
King to death. Without the protection of the Ghostfetus King, Adept
Blackhorn was instantly thrown into a state of terror and was
effortless killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, your power has clearly increased,” Ning
praised. “You were able to kill the infamous Adept Blackhorn with
such ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh.” Northson
scratched his head. “I’m at the peak of the Wanxiang level, after
all, and my Fiendish Skyeater Serpents were upgraded considerably
after I acquired quite a few materials at the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. Naturally, their power has increased substantially.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. The
Dao of Constructs…it required significant amounts of resources and
precious items. “Let’s go. Let’s go take down the next
criminal,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With us four
Wanxiang Adepts working together, taking down this type of criminal
is truly effortless.” The nearby Qingqing was quite smug as well.
As for the Whitewater Hound, he just stood there quietly, smiling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The
dragon-headed warship once more soared into the skies, and Ning’s
group once more embarked on a journey. They would go after the next
criminal - Adept Qiandou!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how well they
had hidden themselves, they still couldn’t escape the eyes and ears
of the Raindragon Guard. Unless, of course, they were like Ning, who
could go hiding within his underwater estate. For everyone else, so
long as they were in this major world which was controlled by the
Grand Xia Dnasty, it would be impossible for them to escape the
assault of the Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Qiandou really
did hide quite far away. This place is three million kilometers away
from Stillwater City, and can be considered one of the most distant
backwaters of the entire Stillwater Commandery. If he were to flee
any further, he would have left the entire Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he left
Stillwater Commandery, then it wouldn’t be for our division of the
Raindragon Guard to pursue him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
chatting amongst themselves at the Crimson Dragon Mountains’
teleportation array. Whoosh! Within Dongyu City, three million
kilometers away, a teleportation array that was more than three
hundred meters high suddenly lit up. Ning, Northson, and the others
all appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, milord
Raindragon Guards.” An old man nearby bowed respectfully. There
were six Zifu Disciples and a group of Xiantian experts present as
well, and they all were incomparably respectful. Ning swept them with
a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dongyu City was a
commandery city where the Grand Xia Dynasty had armies stationed,
much like Swallow Mountain City. The only difference was that within
this commandery city was a small teleportation array of the
Raindragon Guard! The wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains was a major
danger zone and thus it had Primal Daoists and Loose Immortals on
guard, but Dongyu City was an extremely ordinary location, and so it
only had Zifu Disciples present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm.” Ning nodded.
“Junior apprentice-brother, let’s go.” Ning didn’t chat with
these people; he immediately boarded the dragon-headed warship and
soared into the skies. Based on the latest intelligence reports from
the Raindragon Guard, Adept Qiandou was within an ancient mountain
range that was located a few tens of thousands of kilometers outside
of Dongyu City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group searched
carefully for him. Soon, it was night. “There he is.” Ning,
standing atop the warship in the night sky, had been spreading his
divine sense throughout the ground below, to a distance of three
hundred kilometers. He suddenly found that within this mountain,
there was a truly ferociously guarded city. This city was apparently
protected by a vision-impairing formation; one wouldn’t be able to
locate it with the naked eye at all. Fortunately, Ning possessed the
divine sense; otherwise, they would’ve spent months before being
able to find it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a city.”
Ning’s eyes flashed with a killing intent. “Where is it?”
Northson hurriedly asked. “Right below us,” Ning growled. “Let’s
go. Follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning jumped down, and
as he did, a sword flashed and appeared beneath his feet, tearing
through the air as it flew downwards. The Whitewater Hound and
Northson followed him down as well. While charging down…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning
pointed off into the distance, and a stream of water appeared out of
nowhere. It swirled around a distant formation flag, then easily
pulled it out. Instantly, the scenery for a region of around ten
kilometers began to twist and change. The seemingly ordinary, wild
mountains instantly disappeared, transforming into an enormous city
that was filled with a large number of slaves. The slaves were all
carrying out arduous manual labor, either carrying stones, building
walls, or even cutting wood from the surrounding area in order to
further reinforce this city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is really…”
Upon seeing this city appear out of nowhere, Northson stared,
speechless. “Utter wasteful extravagance,” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a cultivator
of vile arts. It’s one thing for him to massacre commoners in order
to complete his vile techniques, but why must he have them build this
city for him? And why must he squeeze them so?” Northson was
immediately able to see that these commoners were under such great
duress while building the city that many were literally worked to
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say a
single word. Because his divine sense covered the entire city, he
could easily sense the despair, agony, pain, and numbness of the
countless people within it! This was a sort of numbness that came
from completely and utter despair. In addition, a number of these
commoners held a boundless amount of resentment in their hearts.
Their hatred so was so strong that Ning’s divine sense could easily
sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is hell!”
Ning suddenly charged into the skies, transforming into a streak of
light and moving to stand in the air directly above this city of
doom. An enormous Waterflame Lotus swirled around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The light of the
Waterflame Lotus was incomparably eyecatching in the night sky.
Instantly, the countless commoners who were engaged in crushing
physical night labor all raised their heads. They saw the enormous
Waterflame Lotus in the air above them, and saw a seemingly small,
frail form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qiandou, you old
demon, hurry up and come out to die!” Ning let out an explosive
roar, which rang like thunder and echoed throughout this entire city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many, incomparably
savage and bloodthirsty Xiantian experts who were in charge of
overseeing this city all began to howl in agony. Blood poured from
each orifice, and they died on the spot. These were the disciples and
grand-disciples of Adept Qiandou, and had supported him in his
evildoings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
was able to tell that these people were surrounded by the foul aura
of sin as well. Ordinary people would neither be surrounded by the
clear aura of positive karma or the foul aura of sin. The fact that
they were surrounded by sin represented that their vileness had
already reached an extremely high level. Against these sin-covered
malefactors, Ning had used his [Soulshaker Art]; because the
difference in power between them was too great, all of them died
right away, blood flowing from their orifices!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could that old
fiend have…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those commoner slaves
stared in astonishment. Those terrifying Xiantian lifeforms, who had
always appeared to be incomparably savage, all fell over, dead. The
slaves simply couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask, which
fellow Daoist has come!?” A white-robed, long-bearded man suddenly
appeared in midair, locking gazes with the distant Ning. Ning stared
at him, not the slightest bit worried that he would flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because, when
he had charged out, Uncle White had already, secretly acted the grand
spacelock formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qiandou, you old
fiend, you have a few young fiends with you.” Ning swept the
distant palace with a glance. There were quite a few Zifu Disciples
standing at the entrance to the palace; clearly, they were the
disciples of this old demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask, who are
you, fellow Daoist?” The old fiend, Qiandou, maintained a smile on
his face. Ning, surrounded by the Waterflame Lotus, stared downwards
towards the hellish landscape below, then said softly, “After you
die and go to the Netherworld Kingdom, you will be tormented in the
eighteenth level of the Netherworld. The torment suffered by these
commoners you tortured to death will be repaid unto you thousands of
times over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die?” Adept
Qiandou shook his head. “So long as I can become an Earth Immortal,
when the time comes, I’ll send a hint of my truesoul into the
Netherworld Kingdom. Given my prowess as an Immortal, I will
willingly become a Ghost Immortal. Why should I fear torment?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earth Immortal?”
Ning stared at him coldly. “Wait to suffer in agony in the
eighteenth level of the Netherworld. Given how many sins you have
committed, I imagine that you won’t be able to endure for many
years before you are tormented to the point of your soul collapsing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The amount of sin he
had committed vastly surpassed Bei Zishan’s. Adept Qiandou’s body
was not surrounded by a foul aura, but by a bloody light! An
eye-piercing bloody light! A bloody light that caused one’s heart
to quail! This amount of sin was utterly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning’s
words came out, Adept Qiandou roared in fury, “I think you’ll be
the one to die instead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. An enormous
pupil of blood suddenly appeared above his head. This enormous bloody
eye, filled with boundless sin and evil, stared directly towards
Ning. And as it did so….boom! An incomparably powerful, bloody,
baleful light shot straight towards Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An ant who wishes to
shake a tree.” Within Ning’s mind appeared the divine visage of
Maiden Nuwa. Nuwa stood there in midair, radiating an endless aura of
light. As soon as the bloody aura touched it, it instantly melted
away like snow in the face of the sun, transforming into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Adept
Qiandou’s face changed, and he hurriedly turned, meaning to flee.
But right at this moment, Ning let out an icy roar. “DIE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His powerful divine
sense swept out in an incomparably savage wave, crushing down upon
Adept Qiandou’s soul. Adept Qiandou instantly felt dizzy and dazed.
Ning pointed towards him with a single finger, and around Adept
Qiandou’s body, a Waterflame Lotus appeared out of nowhere. Adept
Qiandou was completely dazed and unable to fight back; as a result,
as soon as the Waterflame Lotus began to swivel…he was instantly
transformed into meat paste!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those five Zifu
Disciples before the palace were incomparably terrified. The five of
them had followed Adept Qiandou in doing countless evil deeds, and
the tainted aura of sin had surrounded them long ago. Ning pointed to
them from far away, and one Waterflame Lotus after another began to
bloom, glowing with holy light as they crushed these five into meat
paste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were taken
care of at one go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Northson and the
Whitewater Hound, they flew over as well. They displayed no joy; as
they stared down at the countless oppressed commoners, they couldn’t
muster any joy at all. “How could he do such a thing?” Northson
let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This opponent possessed
the ‘Hellblood Demon Eye’, and was extremely hard to deal with.
Ning had a powerful soul, and also possessed a divine will attack; he
was the perfect counter to this person. Thus, they had planned all
along for Ning to be the one to fight him alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is kindness in
the world, but there naturally is evil as well,” Ning said calmly.
“Senior apprentice-brother,” Northson looked at Ning, “Now that
we’ve both completed our missions, what shall we do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Next? Instantly, three blood-soaked names suddenly emerged from the
deepest recesses of Ning’s mind. Dong Seven! Yu Dong! Shui Yi! Ning
had never forgotten these three names. These three names were like
blazing irons that had been imprinted onto his very soul. The most
important people in his life, his mother and father, had died…because
of these three!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a surge of
emotion filled Ning’s breast. Kill! Kill! Kill! When Ning unburied
this matter from where it had lain deep within his heart, he became
filled with hatred and a desire to kill. These three were the three
he hated most in the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next…” Ning said
softly, “I’ll get revenge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get revenge?”
Northson was puzzled. “On who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who slew my
parents!” Ning said slowly. Hearing this, Northson’s face
instantly changed. Qingqing lowered her serpents head, pressing it
against Ning’s arm, as though to console Ning. As for the nearby
Whitewater Hound, he just stared quietly at Ning, his eyes also
filled with the same desire. After all…he had personally witnessed
that nightmarish day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I cannot share the
same heavens with those who slew my parents!” Ning said.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - A Surging Killing Intent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning spoke
very softly, Mu Northson and Qingqing could both sense the boundless
hatred and killing intent within those words. This enmity had sunk
deep into his soul, and had embedded itself within the marrow of his
bones!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could never forget
it. When he had left Swallow Mountain, Ning had deeply desired to
take revenge! However, at that point in time, he didn’t know
anything about the world; it was simply too vast and too alien. That
was why he had decided to join a school and to first increase his own
power, temporarily burying his hatred deep within his heart. Now that
he had finished his training and joined the Raindragon Guard, it was
time to take revenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother,
Uncle,” Ning murmured to himself silently, “Those three of
them…your child will not spare a single one! Not a single one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Ning turned to look at the nearby Northson. “I
am going to take revenge. It will be enough for me to bring along
Qingqing and Uncle White. There’s no need for you to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what the hell are you talking about?!” Northson
said furiously, “I no longer have any kin in this world, now that
my mother is dead! I have no attachments to anyone, so you don’t
need to worry about causing trouble for me. As your junior
apprentice-brother, I know exactly how agonizing your pain is, with
your parents having been killed. In the past, I personally
slaughtered those evil villains and avenged my mother. This time, I
will definitely go with you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. His
mother had died? He had taken revenge on behalf of his mother? He had
no kin left in the world? His junior apprentice-brother had never
told him this before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine!” Ning
nodded, then gave Northson a gentle clap on the shoulders. “You are
a good brother.” Northson looked at Ning, who said, “Let’s go.
Let’s go to Stillwater City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson immediately
said, “Stillwater City? Right…didn’t you say you wanted to get
revenge? As I see it, although we’ve fulfilled two assignments
already, for now, there’s no need for us to go back to the Crimson
Dragon Mountains to turn them in. For now, we can go act against your
enemies while claiming we are on a mission to apprehend suspects on
behalf of the Raindragon Guard. This gives us a good excuse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. In the
past, Xue Hongyi had used the excuse of ‘suspecting that the Ji
clan was harboring criminals’ to investigate Ning himself.
Fortunately, Northmont Baiwei had stopped him. At that time, Baiwei
had the status of ‘Emissary for the Marquisate of Stillwater’; if
he hadn’t, even he would’ve found it difficult to stop this
matter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s exactly
what I was thinking,” Ning said. “However, we still need to go to
Stillwater City to make some preparations. First, I need to get the
intelligence reports on my enemies. Second, I need to buy some magic
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures?”
Northson said, puzzled, “Can it be that your enemies are extremely
powerful, senior apprentice-brother?” Ning shook his head. “No,
they should only be Zifu Disciples. Even if they make a breakthrough,
they’ll only be ordinary Wanxiang Adepts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why must you
buy treasures to deal with them, senior apprentice-brother?”
Northson asked, puzzled. Ning said in a low, growling voice,
“Because…I am going to shatter their souls!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cold malice in
these words caused Northson, Qingqing, and the Whitewater Hound to
all feel shocked. Northson thought back to how when he was a child,
he had slaughtered those enemies…back then, he had been similarly
crazed by hate. He could completely understand what Ning was
currently feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said. “Alright.” The group immediately boarded the dragon-headed
warship, quickly departing and going to Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. Ning
first paid a visit to his good friend, Baiwei. “I already know,”
Baiwei said, “That the most recent group of Raindragon Guard
testees included you, Brother Ji Ning. And the name of your junior
apprentice-brother, Mu Northson, as well.” Baiwei looked towards
Ning, then smiled towards Northson as well. He saw that Ning was
glancing towards the maidservants, and he waved his hand towards
them. “You can leave,” he said, and they all left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwei, I’ve
come to ask you for some help,” Ning said solemnly. “Please,
speak,” Baiwei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need intelligence
reports for three people,” Ning said. “Snowdragon Mountain’s
Dong Seven, Shui Yi, and Yu Dong! However, I don’t wish for the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain to know that I was the one investigating
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei nodded lightly.
“Understood. I’ll immediately arrange for people to go to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain and do some investigations.” “Sorry
for the trouble,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing the three of
them wouldn’t be hard. What made things difficult was Snowdragon
Mountain. Shui Yi and Yu Dong had less impressive backgrounds, but
Dong Seven was the grandson of a Primal Daoist of Snowdragon
Mountain. Once Ning acted against him, no matter how secretively he
acted, Snowdragon Mountain would still investigate…and if they
discovered that someone had once investigated all three of these
individuals, they would definitely grow suspicious. Thus, he had to
leave as few clues behind as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll immediately
send someone to go. In less than two hours, they’ll be able to have
the results,” Baiwei said, rising to his feet. “The two of you
can rest here. I’ll make the arrangements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours later, a
servant came in, carrying three thick tomes and giving them to
Northmont Baiwei. “You can leave now,” Baiwei instructed, and the
servant quietly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei handed the three
reports directly to Ning. “These are the most detailed reports the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain has regarding these three individuals.
Reports are divided into multiple levels, but these are the highest
level reports, and are the most detailed ones, which have all of
their most secret details. However, the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
is just an intelligence network, not the heavens; they can’t
possibly know everything. For example, they have no idea that this
time, it was you, Brother Ji Ning, who wanted these reports.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Human
resources were limited. No matter how formidable the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain was, they couldn’t know everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Seven.” Ning
began to flip through the book. The nearby Baiwei simply drank his
wine, slowly savoring it, while Northson did the same. None of them
spoke or did anything to disturb Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read quite
quickly. This report was fairly detailed; it had records of many of
the events Dong Seven had carried out since he was young. It had
details on some of the problems he had caused Snowdragon Mountain,
and even discussed some of the women he had raped. There were records
of many events…but no records of his attack against Ning’s
parents and his uncle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain isn’t omniscient. Immortal cultivators will
occasionally run into trouble while wandering the world. If they
don’t tell anyone, it really is quite hard to find out about it.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dong Seven…he
truly is a calamity.” As Ning continued to read, he began to
understand that Dong Seven was a child who had been spoiled rotten.
Even now, he was still a mere peak Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Seven came from
the major ‘Dong’ clan. Because the Dong clan had a Primal Daoist
amongst their ranks, Daoist Coldsun, they naturally were an extremely
powerful clan. The Dong clan had quite a few talented figures, and
the earlier Dong One had been the eldest and most talented member of
Dong Seven’s generation! But of course, Dong One had already been
killed by the Dragonwhale King back in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Coldsun
previously had a single son, but his son had died while roaming the
outside world. His son had left behind only one child as well; Dong
Seven. Thus, Daoist Coldsun doted far too much on this sole grandson
of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the likes of
Dong One and the others of his generation would also be treated well,
they naturally couldn’t compare to Dong Seven. Thus, in the Dong
clan, there were many who would flatter and fawn over Dong Seven,
causing him to grow ever more arrogant and brash. His greatest hobby
was to rape beautiful women, but only those with particularly refined
auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, he had caused
countless calamities. However, due to his powerful background and
strong supporters, nothing had ever come of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning frowned. “He actually lives on Snowdragon Mountain, along with
Daoist Coldsun?” Dong Seven truly was coddled too much. Others
found it quite difficult to even see a Primal Daoist in person, but
he actually lived alongside his grandfather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he lives on
Snowdragon Mountain, there’s nothing I can do.” Ning shook his
head. Although he was confident, he wasn’t so crazed as to charge
straight towards an ancient school that had existed for countless
years. Even Loose Immortals would probably be hesitant; after all,
that was the foundation of the entire school, and the various
formations as well as suicide or self-destruct mechanisms there would
be enough to threaten even them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next one.” Ning
turned to Yu Dong’s information. Yu Dong was a cultivator with
tremendous ambition, and who was incredibly calculating. For the sake
of acquiring enough resources, he willing served as Dong Seven’s
henchman! After getting what he wanted for Dong Seven, he had
silently slipped away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s now an early
Wanxiang Adept, and he lives at Mount Mooncrescent with his master, a
peak Wanxiang Adept.” Yu Dong personally hadn’t actually done too
many vile deeds; the records of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, at
least, included only two matters. Naturally, what he had done to
Ning’s parents hadn’t been included!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Adept
Mooncrescent, had actually done quite a few evil deeds. He was a
sinister, despicable fellow who had reached the peak of the Wanxiang
level more than two centuries ago, and was extremely strong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he has a
master, they are at Mount Mooncrescent?” Ning felt relaxed. “This
is in a wild, desolate region; dealing against him won’t be too
hard. Let’s look at the last one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped to Shui
Yi’s materials. Shui Yi…he was originally a servant of the Dong
clan, but was an extremely outstanding one who had been viewed
favorably by the Dong clan. By now, he had become a peak Wanxiang
Adept as well, but because his potential was limited, he had left
Snowdragon Mountain and had always lived within the Dong clan’s
territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dong clan’s
territory?” Ning begin to feel a headache coming. “This is a bit
more troublesome. However…I’ll still be able to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dong clan was the
clan of Daoist Coldsun. Daoist Coldsun, however, stood guard over
Snowdragon Mountain, and so there were no Primal Daoists protecting
the Dong clan. It did have a group of Wanxiang Adepts, but clearly,
the Dong clan wasn’t guarded nearly as tightly as Snowdragon
Mountain was. Ning felt confident in being able to deal with them.
After all, he only needed to kill Shui Yi, not annihilate the entire
Dong clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First kill Yu Dong,
then kill Shui Yi. In the past, it was the two of them who actually
fought against my uncle and my parents; they are the actual killers,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Baiwei could
sense the hard, killing intent radiating from Ning, as well as the
cold, ferocious light flashing through his eyes. Baiwei mused
silently to himself, “My brother, Ji Ning, is normally an extremely
amiable person, but he actually has such a fiendish side to him as
well. This must be a deep enmity, and an extraordinary one at that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwei.”
Ning rose to his feet, and Baiwei hurriedly rose as well. “Sorry
for troubling you, Brother Baiwei. You’ve helped me numerous times.
I won’t waste words thanking you; I, Ji Ning, will remember
everything you’ve done.” Ning clasped his hands. “I won’t
stay any longer. I’ll leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s
anything further you need, Brother Ji Ning, please feel free to tell
me,” Baiwei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything is as I
expected.” Ning clasped his hands again, then led his junior
apprentice-brother and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours later. After
the sun had set. Ning’s group boarded the dragon-headed warship and
flew into the skies, departing from Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this magic
treasure, I will definitely ensure that you won’t even have a
chance to reincarnate!” Ning gripped a magic treasure that looked
like an incense burner, then raised his head. “Junior
apprentice-brother, let’s go south. To Mount Mooncrescent!”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Mooncrescent.
This place was considered holy grounds by everyone within the
surrounding hundred thousand acres, because there was a truly
powerful Wanxiang Adept here, Adept Mooncrescent. And because of
this, the nearby tribes and monsters didn’t dare create any
trouble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a beautiful,
lavish hall. An old man was seated atop a jade bed, radiating a cold,
sinister aura. Above his hands, there floated a black, palm-sized
scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A
respectful voice rang out from outside. “Daddy.” Another voice
rang out as well. The sinister old man revealed a hint of a smile.
“Come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short, ugly looking
man walked in, alongside a tall, azure-robed, beautiful woman. The
ugly man appeared quite calm and collected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Yu Dong…”
The sinister old man looked at the ugly man, nodding mentally to
himself. “When he first apprenticed himself to me, I didn’t hold
him in any regard, but unexpectedly, he was the first amongst my many
disciples who reached the Wanxiang level! In addition, he made his
breakthrough after a few short decades, which is quite fast. He
really can’t be underestimated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his appearances?
Immortal cultivators didn’t care too much about appearances. If you
were both weak and ugly, then others might look down on you, but if
you were powerful…no matter how ugly you were, others would respect
you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And, by the looks of
it, it seems as though Wei’er has taken quite a fancy to Yu Dong as
well.” The sinister old man nodded to himself. “It seems as
though in the end, my lineage will pass into the hands of Yu Dong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wei, daughter, come
over here,” the sinister old man said. The azure-robed woman walked
over, sitting atop the jade bed as well. She hugged the old man’s
arm in a very close manner. “Daddy, this time, senior
apprentice-brother Yu Dong has procured a gift for you. You’ll
definitely like it,” Yue Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The sinister
old man laughed as he looked over. Yu Dong immediately said with
respect, “Master, your disciple just procured a bottle of ‘Three
Immortals’ wine, and so came to offer it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Immortals
wine?” The sinister old man’s eyes instantly lit up, and he
couldn’t help but sniff the air. He had been stuck at the peak
Wanxiang level for more than two centuries, and was close to the end
of his lifespan; he didn’t have much longer to live. For
cultivators who were close to the end of their lives, they cared
deeply about being able to enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Immortals wine
was a truly top-class wine that was incredibly hard to find.
Generally speaking, it was only available in places like Stillwater
City, while hard to procure in backwater places like Mount
Mooncrescent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite
thoughtful.” The sinister old man nodded in approval. He felt more
and more satisfied with this Yu Dong. Despite having reached the
Wanxiang level, Yu Dong had remained under his tutelage, and remained
as respectful as ever. In addition, he served as respectfully as he
would towards his own father…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you showed
me great kindness by transmitting knowledge unto me. What’s a
little wine?” Yu Dong produced a jade tray, atop which was a bottle
of Immortal wine. That incomparably beautiful and intricately carved
jade wine-bottle alone would be considered a priceless treasure in
the mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, if you would be so kind.” Some time later, Yu
Dong and his junior apprentice-sister, Yue Wei, both left the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sinister old man
watched his most capable disciple and his beloved daughter walk off
into the distance. He couldn’t help but nod, especially upon seeing
how respectfully Yu Dong treated his daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within another hall on
Mount Mooncrescent. This was Yu Dong’s estate. This area was
naturally warded by formations, preventing outsiders from entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave,” Yu
Dong instructed his servants upon entering his estate. “Yes.” The
servants and maids all respectfully departed, going to other halls
within this estate, leaving behind only himself and his junior
apprentice-sister, Yue Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After seating himself
in the hall, Yu Dong glanced at Yue Wei, then said calmly, “Kneel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yue Wei immediately
laughed enticingly, her robes immediately disappearing from her body,
revealing her ravishingly beautiful body. She lightly knelt down,
then, like a little dog, slowly crawled forward. And then, moving
close towards to Yu Dong’s legs, she began to lick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, you
held me in such disregard. But now, you are kneeling between my
legs.” Yu Dong looked downwards towards Yue Wei as he would towards
a dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, stop teasing me,” Yue Wei said with an adorable
harrumph. Yu Dong stretched his hand out, grabbing her head and
pushing it down hard. Instantly, Yue Wei began to cough and choke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Yu Dong
laughed wildly. “Endure it.” Yue Wei had no choice but to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later the next morning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” After having
thoroughly enjoyed himself, Yu Dong sat there, pondering. As for Yue
Wei, she sat on his lap. “Junior apprentice-sister, that old
bastard…when will he transmit the Mooncrescent Saber Formation to
me? I’ve served him a long, long time after I became a Wanxiang
Adept, and yet he still hasn’t taught it to me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yue Wei said gently,
“Don’t worry, senior apprentice-brother. I mentioned this to
father before, but at that time, my father was hesitant. By the looks
of it, father is beginning to like you more and more. I’ll mention
it again later. I’ll definitely succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that old
bastard doesn’t die and take that saber formation to the
Netherworld Kingdom with him.” A cold light was in Yu Dong’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Yue Wei said hurriedly, and Yu Dong nodded slightly. He continued to
ponder silently, while the nearby Yue Wei didn’t dare to disturb
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three years. At
most, I’ll wait three more years for that old bastard. I can’t
keep wasting my time like this,” Yu Dong said broodingly while
looking at Yue Wei. “Half a month from now, I’ll go ask the old
bastard to teach me his saber formation; after that, you go help me
speak to him as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yue Wei
nodded obediently. Yu Dong suddenly began to laugh strangely. “Junior
apprentice-sister, if your daddy saw you right now, would he die of
anger? Hahaha…hahahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His evil, wicked
laughter was completely different from his normal, honest attitude.
All of the servants in the estate had been instructed to leave, and
the protective formations had been activated; there was no way any
sound would leave the room, and there was no way to scry inside from
the outside world. Thus, Yu Dong didn’t need to disguise himself at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he was young, he
had understood quite early on that this was a world where the weak
would be devoured by the strong. Thus, he had clawed up, step by
step, either slaughtering or flattering until he had grown powerful
enough to fear no one. However, he had always been very good at
hiding his nature. Those who knew what his true nature was like were
either dead or under his complete control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ji Ning’s
intelligence report had been unable to see through Yu Dong’s
façade. After all…the Heavenly Treasures Mountain wouldn’t
expend too many resources on a minor figure like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mooncrescent
Saber Formation that old bastard possesses was left behind by a
deceased Loose Immortal. Not even Snowdragon Mountain has such a
powerful formation.” In the past, Yu Dong didn’t have any other
options, which was why he had apprenticed himself to Adept
Mooncrescent. However, based on some tools he had, as well as his
many years of service, he had discovered some of Adept Mooncrescent’s
secrets. Thus, he worked ever more diligently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I still cannot
acquire it…then I’ll kill him.” A cold light flashed through Yu
Dong’s eyes. He had originally been an ordinary mortal, and had
clawed his way to his current position. Naturally, he was an
incredibly calculating person, and he had caused the deaths of many.
In the past, he had caused the deaths of two young masters of his
clan, three elders of his clan, and even two genius disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain. However, to this very day, no one knew that it
had been him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That young master ‘Dong
Seven’ of the Dong clan was nothing more than a chess piece to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dragon-headed warship
was in the air above Mount Mooncrescent. Ning stared downwards.
“Senior apprentice-brother, aren’t you going to attack?”
Northson was puzzled. He could sense that Ning was filled with a
powerful killing intent, but upon reaching Mount Mooncrescent, they
had actually come to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just yet.”
Ning stared downwards. His divine sense had already been spread out,
covering the entire Mount Mooncrescent. He could see everything going
on within it. In front of Adept Mooncrescent, Yu Dong had acted one
way, but upon returning to his own hall…he had acted in a
completely different manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Yu Dong seems
to be quite an extraordinary fellow,” Ning mused to himself. His
divine sense hadn’t been able to find a single flaw in Yu Dong’s
façade before Adept Mooncrescent. If this person had become friends
with Ning, most likely even Ning would have been fooled into trusting
him; he was definitely a very steady, sure-footed person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to start
as an ordinary mortal and reach this current level…” Ning thought
back to the history of Yu Dong as mentioned in the intelligence
reports, then silently mused to himself, “I imagine it wasn’t as
simple as the reports described. The reports made it seem as though
everything had been smooth sailing for Yu Dong, and that he had
flattered and fawned over many as he eventually reached his current
heights. I thought that he was just talented and lucky, but now, it
seems that he is quite the ambitious figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However! Even if you
are an ambitious, ruthless, formidable figure, today you shall
definitely die!” A cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes. In the
world of Immortal cultivators, personal power was more important than
games of intrigue. For example, with his divine sense, Ning was able
to clearly see each of Yu Dong’s actions, and so Yu Dong’s
hidden, true face was instantly discovered by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said, pointing towards the distant estate. “Let’s go to Yu Dong’s
estate.” “Alright,” Northson immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound,
now in human form, also stared towards the distant estate. His eyes
were also filled with killing intent; after all, he had personally
experienced the events of that year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The
dragon-headed warship surged downwards towards the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White. Set up
the spacelock formation,” Ning sent mentally. “Alright.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded, then silently slipped out of the ship,
beginning to stealthily set down spacelock formation flags in the
area around Mount Mooncrescent. The grand spacelock formation was
able to take up a hundred kilometers of space…the entire Mount
Mooncresent was covered by it. But of course, they didn’t activate
the formation yet. Once they did, Adept Mooncrescent and Yu Dong
would instantly notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dragon-headed
warship flew towards the air above the estate. Yu Dong and his
beautiful, bewitching junior apprentice-sister were openly engaging
in lewd, lascivious acts within their estate. Yu Dong, despite acting
in a crazed manner, had a very calm look in his eyes; only, he would
occasionally let out a vile laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YU DONG!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a voice rang
out from on high. Yu Dong, shocked, instantly came to a halt, while
his junior apprentice-sister also came to a halt and said, puzzled,
“Senior apprentice-brother, who is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and get up.”
Yu Dong’s body quickly became covered by his robes, and the same
happened for his junior apprentice-sister, Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong called back in
a warm, loud voice, “Which fellow Daoist has come?” At the same
time, he released the protective formation. He immediately saw the
dragon-headed warship in the distant skies. Upon seeing it, Yu Dong
felt a slight hint of surprise; he was an experienced person, after
all, and he knew that no ordinary Immortal cultivator would be in
possession of such a fine construct-warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, hurry up and ask Master to come,” Yu Dong sent
mentally. “Understood.” A leaf appeared in Yue Wei’s hands, and
she lightly twisted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome,
delicate-looking youth dressed in furs flew down from the
dragon-headed warship. He had an azure serpent wrapped around one
wrist, while a white-haired, white-robed man and a white-robed youth
were behind him. The fur-clad youth, the leader of the group, said in
a calm voice, “An old friend, of course!”
</P>

Chapter 8 - The Mysterious Adept Mooncrescent
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The highest hall on
Mount Mooncrescent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My daughter, Wei?”
The sinister old man’s face changed. His daughter had shattered the
talisman he had given her, and he could clearly sense that the
talisman had been shattered in Yu Dong’s nearby estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
With Yu Dong protecting her, what sort of problems could Wei have
encountered, that she would suddenly break the talisman? This is
Mount Mooncrescent.” Adept Mooncresent couldn’t believe that in
his own territory, his daughter would encounter any danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mooncrescent
instantly transformed into a streak of black light, departing from
his hall and charging towards the skies, flying towards Yu Dong’s
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how fast peak
Wanxiang Adepts moved at, as soon as Ji Ning emerged from his
dragon-headed warship, Adept Mooncrescent appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Adept
Mooncresscent, upon seeing the distant dragon-headed warship in the
skies, and upon seeing Ji Ning and Mu Northson, couldn’t help but
secretly feel alarmed. Given his experience and judgment, he could
immediately tell, just through that distant glance, that these were
definitely no ordinary cultivators. No wonder his daughter had
instantly shattered the talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
Daoist friends have come to visit my Mount Mooncrescent,” Adept
Mooncrescent said with a loud laugh. “Why haven’t you come to
visit me, and have instead come to my disciple’s place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice reverberated
in the air, and as it did, Adept Mooncrescent landed in the
courtyard, standing in front of Yu Dong and Yue Wei, who respectfully
moved backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are they?”
Adept Mooncrescent sent to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daddy, I’ve never
met them before,” Yue Wei hurriedly sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ve never
met them either,” Yu Dong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, if you don’t
know them, why would they suddenly come to my place, but not come
visit me, and instead visit you?” Adept Mooncrescent barked
mentally at them, and Yu Dong didn’t dare to say a single word in
response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Adept
Mooncrescent still had a smile on his face. He looked towards Ning
and the others in midair. “Fellow Daoists, it seems as though my
disciple doesn’t know you; why, then, do you say that you are old
friends?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mooncrescent.”
Ning took a single step forward, descending from the skies to the
estate below. Northson and the Whitewater Hound followed behind him.
Ning said, “I have something to discuss with your disciple, Yu
Dong. I’d like to ask you, Adept Mooncrescent, and your daughter to
temporarily withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong’s face
changed, and Adept Mooncrescent couldn’t help but feel shocked as
well. Previously, he had only spoken mentally with his daughter, but
this fur-clad youth actually knew that they were father and
daughter…clearly, he had come prepared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw?” Yue Wei
grew frantic. Her loyalty had long since been given to Yu Dong, and
she couldn’t help but mentally send, “Daddy, we have no idea who
these people are. You can’t let senior apprentice-brother face them
on his own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daughters always
favor outsiders.” Adept Mooncrescent frowned as he looked at his
daughter. At the same time, Yu Dong sent frantically, “Master, it
seems to me that these people must have come with a plot in mind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to your
master,” Adept Mooncrescent snapped back, then laughed loudly. “You
wish to speak in private with my disciple, but I don’t even know
who you are…isn’t this a bit too impolite?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
covered the entire mountain. Thus, although Adept Mooncrescent had
arrived quite quickly, Ning could’ve killed Yu Dong even more
quickly. Still, the hatred he felt towards the murderer of his
parents had caused Ning’s heart to become filled with rage. To kill
his enemy so quickly? That would be letting him off so easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning wanted was
for this man to die in regret, agony, and despair! Only thus would he
be able to give vent to the hatred in his heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mooncrescent.”
Ning’s face sank. “I respected you, which is why I asked you to
leave. To tell you the truth, the reason I wish to speak in private
with your disciple, Yu Dong, is because I suspect that he is
colluding with a criminal I am pursuing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Colluding with a
criminal?” Adept Mooncrescent was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Colluding?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yue Wei and Yu Dong
were both greatly shocked as well. Ning waved his hand, and a
medallion appeared within it, atop which was the image of a
Raindragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindragon
Guard!” Adept Mooncrescent’s face turned solemn. He knew that
trouble had truly arrived today; anyone capable of becoming a
Raindragon Guard was a true elite, and even he didn’t feel
confident in being able to defeat this youth in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yue Wei felt nervous as
well; to her, a Zifu Disciple, any Raindragon Guard was an
incomparably powerful individual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Yu Dong, he was
absolutely panicking. “I’ve never offended the Raindragon Guard,
and I’ve never met these three. What on earth is going on?” He
quickly went through a mental list of those he had killed, but no
matter what, he couldn’t find any flaws in his plots; he had no
idea what these people had come for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come to Mount
Mooncrescent for the purpose of seeking out Yu Dong and chatting with
him,” Ning said coldly. “Adept Mooncrescent, are you going to
interfere in the Raindragon Guards carrying out their cases?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mooncrescent’s
face clenched. He definitely wouldn’t be able to handle the
repercussions of such an act. But at this time, Yu Dong spoke out. He
said respectfully, “I don’t know what you wish of me, milord
Raindragon Guard; if you are asking questions pertaining to a case,
why must you avoid my master? If you have any questions, ask away; I,
Yu Dong, will definitely be fully honest and speak no word which is
not true.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having clawed to his
current position over many years, Yu Dong was an incomparably
intelligent man. Since this ‘Raindragon Guard’ insisted on
separating him from his master, he definitely wouldn’t let his
master leave. Once his master left, he would probably be at the
complete mercy of this man, without any protection at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. If you have
any questions, ask them here,” Adept Mooncrescent said hastily. “I
definitely won’t interfere in the Raindragon Guards carrying out a
case.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face sank.
This Adept Mooncrescent had reached the peak of the Wanxiang level
more than two centuries ago, and was close to the end of his life.
Because of this, Ning didn’t dare to underestimate him at all.
Although his talent was inferior to the likes of Dong One, he had
trained for very long and must have had many fortuitous encounters;
an old fellow like him would surely have many tricks up his sleeve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To take away Yu Dong
while he was present would be quite difficult. As for Northson, he
pointed towards Adept Mooncrescent and cursed angrily, “Mooncrescent,
we Raindragon Guards are carrying out a case, but you are here
causing trouble. I urge you to immediately depart! Otherwise…don’t
blame us two brothers for being merciless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two sirs,” Adept
Mooncrescent said, a smile still on his face, “This is the talisman
of the Northmont clan of Stillwater.” As he spoke, a blood-red
medallion appeared in his hands, with the characters ‘North’ and
‘Mont’ atop it. “You can refuse to give face to Snowdragon
Mountain, but you should still give face to the Northmont clan of
Stillwater, yes? If you have any questions, ask them right now. If
you have no questions, hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A medallion of the
Northmont clan?” Ning was startled. This wasn’t something an
ordinary person could produce. The medallion which Baiwei had given
him was merely the medallion of his father, Northmont Blacktiger, not
the true medallion of the Northmont clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As good friends of
Baiwei, he had learned quite a few things. Someone capable of
producing the ‘blood medallion of the Northmont clan’ was
definitely someone who had a deep connection to the Northmont clan of
Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been so many
years, and this is only the second time I’ve ever taken out this
medallion.” Adept Mooncrescent looked towards Ning’s group. “I
haven’t much longer to live, and I really don’t want to trouble
the Northmont clan to help me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his words were
casual, the threat behind them was real. This caused looks of delight
to appear on the faces of Yue Wei and Yu Dong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what should we do?” Northson sent mentally.
“This old fellow was actually able to take out a medallion of the
Northmont clan; I imagine he has an impressive background. How about
we step back for now…then find another chance later?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mooncrescent.”
A hint of anger was in Ning’s gaze. “You have truly decided to
stand up for him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mooncrescent
smiled, then nodded. He could tell that this Raindragon Guard
appeared fierce but was actually nervous; he trusted that this person
would soon leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can protect him
for now, but I refuse to believe you can protect him forever!” Ning
turned and said, “Junior apprentice-brother, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Northson
let out an angry snort as well, also turning and leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…a savage look flashed through the eyes of Ning, who had just
turned his back on Adept Mooncrescent. This was savagery born from
long-suppressed hatred. However, since Adept Mooncrescent and Yu Dong
couldn’t see Ning’s face…they were feeling quite smug, and a
smile was actually on Adept Mooncrescent’s own face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s powerful
divine will suddenly swept outwards like a raging river, crushing
directly towards Adept Mooncrescent. BOOM! It viciously collided
against his soul. [Soulshaker Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Mooncrescent was
close to the end of his life, and he now only cared for enjoying
himself; as a result, his Dao-heart had actually weakened
considerably. Still, since Adept Mooncrescent would never encounter
the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, he hadn’t cared too
much about the weakening of his Dao-heart. At this moment, however,
as Ning’s divine will came crushing downwards, Adept Mooncrescent
instantly felt his soul shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good! A divine
will art!” He had many years of experience, and he had risked his
life many times in the past for the Northmont clan. His Dao-heart was
consequently still quite firm, and he was instantly shocked. “Wake
up! Wake up!” Adept Mooncrescent’s soul was struggling fiercely,
and a hint of clarity appeared in his eyes. “Saber formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as he was about to
activate the supreme technique which he had used to dominate the
region, the ‘Mooncrescent Saber Formation’, a mesmerizingly
beautiful and seemingly slow sword-light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light was
absolutely breathtaking! Just as ten black sabers appeared in the
surrounding area and were about to join together to block, the
sword-light slashed past one of the black sabers…and chopped
directly onto the body of Adept Mooncresent. The two scimitars in
Adept Mooncrescent’s hands moved to block, but were knocked flying
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! His body was
rent in half, and blood splattered everywhere. Ning appeared directly
behind Adept Mooncrescent, Darknorth sword in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant…he
had used the [Soulshaker Art], the [Starseizing Hand], the Windwing
Evasion, and also the Manifold Thistlethorns of the [Three-Foot
Sword]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant, Ning
had completely exploded forth with his most powerful attacks! This
was an old fellow who had lived for very long, and who had an
unfathomable background…Ning didn’t want to waste too much time
with him. If he did, who knew what might happen? Ning’s
subconscious had been warning him…that this old fellow would be
extremely hard to deal with! He had to instantly execute the old man
as he was feeling smug and overconfident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you killed…”
Yu Dong came to his senses. Staring at Adept Mooncrescent’s
bisected body, his face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth sword in
hand, Ning stared coldly at him. The icy look in his eyes caused Yu
Dong’s heart to shudder. Ning said in a growling, cold voice,
“Forget about a damn medallion…even if members of the Northmont
clan were present, I would still kill him!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_9___Why__Why"></A>
Chapter 9 - Why, Why?!?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong felt despair.
The youth in front of him was simply too terrifying; he had actually
killed Yu Dong’s master, Adept Mooncrescent, in an instant…and
that divine will attack! Yu Dong had personally sensed it as well,
and had gone dizzy for a brief moment. He knew exactly what that sort
of short-term dizziness represented in a battle between Immortal
cultivators, where life and death was determined in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord Raindragon
Guard.” Yu Dong was incomparably frantic; he could sense the
surging, killing intent coming from the person before him. “Are you
sure there isn’t a mistake? I, Yu Dong, have always been unwilling
to offend people, and in fact, I’ve never offended others. Milord
Raindragon Guard, is it possible that you’ve been deceived? Killing
me isn’t a major matter, but if you were to let the real culprit
escape, that’d be a disaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong was trying his
best to dissuade Ning. Ning just laughed. “Deceived?” His
laughter caused Yu Dong to shiver. Could it be that Ning’s father
and mother had deceived him? In addition, Ning’s Uncle White, who
had personally experienced the events of that year, was standing
right next to him. How could there be any mistake?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The real culprit is
enjoying himself while you, milord, have been deceived into acting
against me,” Yu Dong said frantically. Ning, seeing the frantic,
terrified look on Yu Dong’s face as he tried to dissuade him, only
felt a surge of satisfaction in his heart. The more panicked his
enemy was, the more agonized and desperate he was, the more satisfied
Ning would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.
Uncle. Can you see this?” Ning murmured in his heart. “This Yu
Dong is just the first one. All of them will slip into despair. They
will die in regret,” Ning promised himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong watched as the
freezing light in Ning’s eyes continued to grow, and he couldn’t
help but grow increasingly frantic. What should he do? What should he
do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had yet to become a
true leader within Snowdragon Mountain; had yet to make his name
known throughout the world. How could he die like this? Yu Dong’s
heart was filled with a strong unwillingness to accept this. What he
desired the most was not to slowly, stealthily clamber his way up to
the top using tricks and stratagems; he wanted to use absolute power
to shock the world and be revered by countless individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had yet to truly
explode onto the world’s stage! The vast world had yet to hear of
his name! “I have to go all out!” Yu Dong felt as though he had
become suddenly trapped back into his early, childhood days when he
had to fight and kill, with only a hint of a chance of survival.
Success meant that he would rise to the heavens, while failure meant
that he would die without a place to be buried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true right
now. If he were to escape, he would be able to soar to the heavens.
If he died, he would truly not even have a place to be buried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister.” Yu Dong looked towards Yue Wei, then sent
urgently, “Help me stop him at any cost.” He trust in his junior
apprentice-sister, trusted in his own abilities. He knew with
absolute certainty that his junior apprentice-sister wouldn’t
hesitate to sacrifice her own life for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yue Wei’s eyes
reddened, and infinite love radiated from her eyes. “Do it!” Yu
Dong howled mentally. Swoosh! Yue Wei threw herself straight towards
Ning, just like a moth throwing itself into a flame. Her Zifu Lake
instantly began to detonate. Tears were at the corners of Yue Wei’s
eyes, and she stared at Yu Dong with a longing look in her eyes as
she sent to him, “Senior apprentice-brother, I truly do love you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Waterflame
Lotus had both dire-ice and earthflame merged into it. The power of
his Waterflame Lotus was consequently much greater than before…the
self-detonation of a Zifu Disciple wouldn’t be able to move him in
the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I truly do love you!” Her voice echoed in his
mind, and even Yu Dong felt his heart shake. But then, he instantly
suppressed this feeling. He understood that this ‘love’ his
junior apprentice-sister felt towards him was nothing more than a
natural ‘love’ that would emerge once a person’s soul had been
completely dominated and tamed. It was precisely because her mind had
been tamed that she was willing to die for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this love?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was just slavery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. As the explosion
rang out, Yu Dong instantly fled far away, and as he did, he produced
an insect nest in his hands. “Children, go, stop them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Northson and
Whitewater Hound just watched, not interfering. As for Ning, the
Waterflame Lotus around him first blocked the self-detonation of that
woman, and then greeted the countless venomous pests that swarmed
towards him. The enormous Waterflame Lotus was imbued with both
dire-ice and earthflame, which were no weaker than divine abilities.
However, after imbuing both into the Waterflame Lotus, they both
reached new heights of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under that grinding,
killing power, the countless venomous pests were all ground into
dust, without a single one of them able to survive for even a moment.
Seconds later, the countless, heaven-covering swarm of venomous pests
that had been attacking Ning had all been reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Yu Dong
had charged far away into the distance, and activated a bewildering
formation. Instantly, the area around him changed and twisted into
illusions as he remained within its borders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think that
you’ll be able to escape, just because you are hiding within a
bewildering formation?” Ning took a single step forward, towards
the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared to be
quite brash and arrogant, but in truth, he was being extremely
cautious. His divine sense had already covered this entire area, to a
distance of a hundred kilometers, and everything was under his
control. If a Primal Daoist suddenly appeared, Ning would no longer
delay, and would instantly kill Yu Dong. But now? Since no one had
appeared to stop him, Ning would slowly torment him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long-suppressed
hatred within Ning’s heart made it so that he wasn’t willing to
let the man die too easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Within the
bewildering formation, Yu Dong watched as Ning walked in. Ning didn’t
appear to be the slightest bit puzzled or baffled by the formation,
and he walked directly towards Yu Dong. “How can this be?! Seal
it!” Yu Dong once again used a formation technique; this was his
estate, and naturally he had quite a few formations present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurry light sprang
up, protecting him. Swish. A sword-light flashed past, and Ning
easily chopped apart the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too weak.” Ning
continued to slowly stroll forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teleport.” Yu Dong
clutched at his precious Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal, intending to
flee…but it was completely useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The surrounding
region has already been spacelocked.” Ning continued to walk
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong finally went
berserk. He howled with rage, “What the hell do you want?! The
bewildering formation is useless against you, you effortlessly killed
my venomous bugs, you killed even my master with a single sword
blow…and you even prepared a spacelock formation in advance! You
are so powerful and so calculating…what the hell did I do to piss
you off?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a figure
appeared before him, moving as fast as lightning. A sword-light
pierced directly into Yu Dong’s dantian. One magic treasure after
another tumbled out from his body. Only the magic robe he wore on
him, as well as the bracer on his arm, remained his; the rest all
fell out, no longer under his control. This sword attack was so fast
that Yu Dong wasn’t even able to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you!” Yu
Dong stared. Ning replied calmly, “The Zifu in your dantian has
already been destroyed by me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong was absolutely
terrified. The Zifu in his dantian was his foundation as a
cultivator; it had been destroyed, just like that? In the instant it
had been destroyed, a feeling of weakness suddenly filled his body,
causing him to be incomparably terrified…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you just
kill me cleanly?” Yu Dong howled with rage. “Kill you?” Ning
shook his head. “I simply destroyed your Zifu in your dantian
because I was afraid that you would commit suicide.” If the Zifu
was present, Yu Dong would’ve been easily able to self-detonate his
Zifu Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But with his Zifu
destroyed, Yu Dong had been transformed into an ordinary mortal. But
of course, despite being an ‘ordinary’ mortal, his body had been
nourished for many years by elemental ki, and so it would still be
quite powerful, comparable to an ordinary Xiantian lifeform.
Unfortunately, he was now no longer able to use magic treasures;
naturally, he wouldn’t even be able to kill himself in front of
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afraid that I’d
commit suicide?” A look of terror appeared on Yu Dong’s face.
What the hell sort of a grudge was this? This person wouldn’t even
let him commit suicide?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the destruction of
his Zifu, the formation around him naturally vanished. Northson and
the Whitewater Hound walked over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enjoy this,” Ning
said with a cold laugh. His elemental ki quickly formed into a
shining runic seal in front of him. Upon seeing the shining rune, Yu
Dong seemed to realize something. Instantly, utter horror appeared on
his face, and he immediately turned to flee. Ning, with a gentle
flick of his fingers, sent that shining runic seal into Yu Dong’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!” Yu Dong let
out a miserable cry, his skin and his bones beginning to twist and
his skin beginning to turn red. “AHH, AHHHH!!” An agonized scream
ripped out from his throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong was like a
lobster that was being boiled alive; his entire body was turning red,
and he fell to the ground, beginning to twitch and twist about. He
felt as though countless bugs were crawling beneath his skin, and
could even see his skin begin to char and turn black.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heartburner
Art?” Northson was secretly shocked. This was a torturing technique
possessed by the Black-White College’s Dao Repository Vault.
Because it didn’t have much combat potential, one didn’t need too
many black-white pellets to trade for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had memorized it
long ago. When he had memorized it…it was for the purpose of
allowing his enemies to enjoy its taste! Enjoy the taste of having
their hearts been set aflame! When Ning’s father and mother had
died, he himself had been filled with the utmost of agony, despair,
and hatred. He had decided long ago to do the same in gaining
revenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me tell me tell
me tell me…” Yu Dong howled hoarsely as he stared at Ning, his
eyes filled with madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
still clear-minded. Even though you have the soul of a Wanxiang
Adept, for you to stay awake for so long is inconceivable.” Ning
let out a cold snort. “It seems as though your Dao-heart is even
stronger than I had anticipated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why, why?!” Yu
Dong’s eyes were filled with resentment. As for Ning, he turned
towards Uncle White, who was by his side. Uncle White instantly
transformed into mist, then reformed into a large, snowy white hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Dong. Do you
remember me?” The Whitewater Hound looked towards Yu Dong. Yu
Dong’s agonized eyes were suddenly filled with shock and
resentment. Immortal practitioners had nearly perfect memories.
Because Uncle White was now a Wanxiang Diremonster, and because he
was in human form, Yu Dong had been unable to recognize him earlier.
Now that Uncle White had returned to his true form…Yu Dong
immediately thought back to the events of that year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, look.
That little lady looks quite attractive. That face, that aura, that
attitude…ohoho!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm, not bad at all!
And she seems to be pregnant as well…hah, just what I like. The two
of you, go over there and catch that little lady alive. Be careful
though; those two men next to her should both be Zifu Disciples. The
two of you had best not grow careless and fail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, leave
it to us. We’ll definitely catch that little lady and bring her
over to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those events…that
battle…everything came to his mind. Deep in his memory, he thought
back to how both of those men had been willing to sacrifice their
lives for that woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister, the
two of you, go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow, go. Little
White, take her away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that battle, he and
his accomplice, ‘Shui Yi’, were both just peak Zifu Disciples,
while their opponents had both used forbidden arts. That woman’s
older brother…he was enormously powerful! He had been able to lock
down the two of them and let that woman, along with the other,
heavily wounded youth, to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the end, he
and Shui Yi had naturally killed that woman’s older brother in
their rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They…they…” Yu
Dong’s entire body was beginning to char. He stared towards Ning
with completely bloodshot eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were my father,
mother, and uncle!” Tears began to appear in Ning’s eyes, and he
growled out, “And I, I was the child that woman was pregnant with.
I…have come for revenge!”
</P>

Chapter 10 - A Disaster Caused
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My uncle, Yuchi
Mount. My mother, Yuchi Snow. My father, Ji Yichuan!” Ji Ning
stared at him, his eyes filled with pain and madness. “At the time,
you didn’t give a damn about them at all, did you? In fact, you’ve
forgotten all about them. But now, I have come to take revenge for
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words came one
at a time from the innermost depths of his heart. As for Yu Dong, he
could feel the hatred oozing from the fur-clad youth. “This
youth…he’s the child that woman was pregnant with?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty years…it’s
only been twenty years. That child was born, and now is easily able
to kill my master, Adept Mooncrescent. I…what the hell type of an
enemy have I, Yu Dong, created for myself.” Yu Dong had always been
extremely cautious and unwilling to offend important figures. Even
when killing a few geniuses, he had been extremely cautious and made
sure to leave behind no clues that it had been him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unexpectedly, that
pregnant woman he had simply wanted to catch in order to flatter and
pander to young master Dong Seven had given birth to such a
terrifying youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…I actually fell
due to this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Dong in absolute
agony due to his torment, but in his mind, one scene after another
flashed by. Scenes of how he had clawed his way up the ladder as a
youth. In order to reach further heights, he had been willing to do
anything! He had even been able to toy with and manipulate figures
who were more powerful than him, and he had made them into his pawns.
And now, he had become a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been
calculating my entire life, but I failed due to this…” Yu Dong’s
eyes were filled with torment. Suddenly, he let out a final, furious
howl. “The heavens conspired against me! I don’t accept this, I
can’t accept this!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his howl rang out
and echoed in the estate, Yu Dong’s charring body suddenly began to
blaze with fire as his entire body started to roast. As for Ning, he
just watched calmly. Suddenly, an incense burner appeared in his
hands. “Collect it!” Ning willed this to be done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
could clearly see a soul be absorbed directly into the incense
burner. There were many types of magic treasures that were meant to
be used against the soul, such as the ‘Myriad Wraiths Banner’ and
the like, that were capable of sucking souls into them. As for Ning’s
incense burner, it was an item with a different purpose that had a
similar effect. However, it was just meant to absorb in a soul and
then destroy the soul’s power; it could be considered a sort of
supportive treasure that couldn’t actually be used to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Yu Dong can be
considered a formidable figure as well,” Northson sighed. “He was
able to claw his way up from an ordinary commoner to the Wanxiang
Adept level, and was even able to make Adept Mooncrescent’s
daughter be willing to sacrifice her life for him! Formidable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway through his
words, Northson suddenly stopped speaking. He couldn’t help but
look at the nearby Ji Ning. This Yu Dong was Ning’s hated enemy,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze was as
deep and tranquil as the waters of a lake. He glanced calmly at the
blazing corpse on the ground, then said calmly, “He was indeed a
formidable figure. However, he was unscrupulous in his actions…for
the sake of being able to reach a higher position, he was willing to
do anything! For the sake of ingratiating himself to that young
master Dong Seven, he was actually willing to act against my mother,
even though she was pregnant! For the sake of protecting my mother,
my uncle died on the spot, while my father’s future potential in
his Immortal path was shattered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, Mother
and Father still died. Just for the sake of ingratiating himself with
Dong Seven, he was able to do such a thing…” Ning thought back to
what he had seen with his divine sense, and how Yu Dong had treated
Yue Wei as he might a sex slave. This person was completely
unscrupulous. As the saying went, if one often walked by the river,
eventually, one’s shoes would get wet. Even if Yu Dong didn’t
fall in Ning’s hands today, eventually, a different expert would
have come to kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of Immortal
cultivation was one of self-reliance! Tricks, strategies, outside
sources of help, waylaying others…they would only allow one to rise
to prominence briefly. In the end, the grave would await.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Self-reliance was the
only true, eternal path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Ning
waved his hand, collecting all of the magic treasures within the
courtyard. “Let’s hurry up and leave.” Ning looked towards
Northson and Uncle White. “Earlier, that Adept Mooncrescent gave me
a very bad feeling. I imagine he must have a significant background;
we cannot tarry here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Uncle
White nodded. “Right.” Northson agreed as well. “That blood
medallion of the Northmont clan proves that he is dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning’s group
quietly snuck away from Mount Mooncrescent. Nobody noticed their
departure at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair. The
dragon-headed warship once more changed colors, to a pure,
pitch-black color as it slowly flew forward. “Father. Mother.
Uncle.” Ning quietly murmured to them, “I’ve already killed one
of our three enemies. Don’t worry. Not a single one of them will
survive! And uncle’s only child…one day, I’ll find a way to
find her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what Ning’s
father had said, his uncle had a single daughter. But where exactly
was this cousin of his? What was her name? What did she look like?
Unfortunately, Ning didn’t know the answer to any of these
questions. It would be very hard to find her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning didn’t
give up, because the more powerful an Immortal cultivator was, the
more options they would have to them…he had heard that some
legendarily powerful Immortals could, with the flick of a finger,
even be able to calculate what events would unfold in the future. If,
in the future, he was able to learn these techniques, searching for
his cousin probably wouldn’t be too difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Whitewater
Hound just watched quietly. He also felt incomparably excited at
having been able to kill one of their hated foes, and also felt
gratified in his heart. He murmured silently to himself, “Big
Brother, our child Ning has grown more and more powerful. Even a peak
Wanxiang Adept was slaughtered by him. Ning’s name will definitely
be spread throughout the vast, endless world, and he will become a
truly influential and famous figure in the world ruled over by the
Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson spoke out. Ning looked over to him.
“Shall we go to the Cloudfields?” The Snowcloud Fields was the
place where the Dong clan had established their foundations. Shui Yi
was a Zifu Disciple of the Dong clan. If they were to kill Shui Yi,
they would naturally have to go to the Snowcloud Fields. “Yes.
We’ll go right now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that’s an
extremely large clan,” Northson said hurriedly. “They have more
than ten Wanxiang Adepts, and it is also the tribe of a Primal
Daoist. Although that Primal Daoist stands guard over Snowdragon
Mountain, he certainly will have left some protective techniques for
his clan. And, at a critical moment, the Primal Daoist himself might
hurry back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I know.
Don’t worry, junior apprentice-brother. I’m not so arrogant as to
go head-on against a Primal Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
are clear-minded.” Northson nodded. When he had watched Ning kill
Yu Dong, Northson had begun to worry. He had personally undergone a
similar experience, and he knew that once one faced the killers of
one’s parents, one might go berserk, at which point one really
might be capable of anything. He didn’t wish for Ning to throw his
life away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, my son,” the
nearby Whitewater Hound urged, “As I see it, let’s first
investigate the treasures left behind by Adept Mooncrescent. I, too,
continue to feel as though that Adept Mooncrescent was a very
dangerous person.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
Northson both nodded. They immediately began to bind the magic
treasures left behind by Adept Mooncrescent and began to search
through his storage-type magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Mooncrescent was
as calm and peaceful as before. The servants and retainers didn’t
even know that Adept Mooncrescent had died. However, roughly two
hours after Ning’s group had left, the surrounding space began to
buggle and twist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A completely
pitch-black sword-shaped warship appeared in the air above the
mountain. Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh. One blood-robed figure after
another immediately flew out from it, and in the blink of an eye, the
skies became filled with thirteen of them. Their leader had a silvery
flying sword embroidered on the sleeves of his robes. As for the
other twelve, they had grayish flying swords embroidered on their
sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” A
powerful divine sense instantly swept downwards, covering the area.
The leader of the blood-robed men, a bald figure, had bizarre runes
atop his skull. His gaze was icy cold as he stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain? Second
Brother, he…?” A blood-robed man next to the leader whispered.
“He’s dead.” The bald, blood-robed man’s voice was gravelly;
it sounded ear-piercing, like sabres clashing against each other.
“Although his corpse has already been destroyed by the murderer,
the aura of the battle is still present, and the scent of Second
Bro’s blood remains in the air. Actually, back when Second Bro’s
candle, which we had within our main hall alongside all the other
candles, went out, he had already died! Only, none of you were
willing to believe it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could that be?
Old Second Bro was close to the end of his life, and he had returned
to Mount Mooncrescent to enjoy his retirement. He didn’t have any
enemies, and even if he did, when he took out our blood medallion of
the Northmont clan, shouldn’t he have been able to scare them off?
Who would have dared to forcibly kill Old Second Bro?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ole Second Bro was
extremely powerful as well. Old Second Bro acquired his Mooncrescent
Saber Formation thanks to his many military accomplishments, and it
was tremendously powerful. Perhaps a few geniuses at the Wanxiang
level would be able to defeat him, but he should still be able to
withstand them for a period of time. Giving his fleeing abilities, he
shouldn’t have found it too difficult to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only possibility
is that someone knew all of Old Second Bro’s abilities, and so
specially set things up so that they could kill him at one blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group continued to
chat amongst themsleves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Second Bro
fought in our squad for more than a century. Countless generations of
brothers formed lifelong friendships with him! He had returned to his
own Mount Mooncrescent, but was killed by someone here? The other old
brothers won’t accept this lying down. Others should feel relieved
if we don’t bully them; who dares to bully us?! We definitely must
avenge him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We must take
revenge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoever killed Old
Second Bro, we must kill him. We’ll destroy his soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The brothers of the
Shadow Army cannot be killed without repercussion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the blood-robed
figures were filled with furious, baleful auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the bald,
blood-robed leader, he said in a cold voice, “Investigate! We must
investigate this thoroughly! We need to find out who killed Old
Second Bro. He had gone home to enjoy his retirement, but they still
refused to spare him…we must find the killer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back.
I’ll ask the Old Captain to help and also have the headquarters of
the Shadow Army to initiate an investigation into who the murderer
is.” The bald man said in a cold, grim voice, “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The group of
blood-robed men all flew back into that pitch-black, sword-shaped
warship. A spatial ripple once more appeared, and then the
pitch-black warship disappeared into thin air once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, Northson,
the Whitewater Hound, and Qingqing, they were going through the
relics left behind by Adept Mooncrescent. Yu Dong’s items were
mostly Mortal-ranked, and so they were the first to be bound. Ning’s
group was surprised as the items contained within his storage
treasures, because his wealth was actually comparable to Dong One and
Northriver Zhou’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s group
was primarily interested in binding Adept Mooncrescent’s magic
treasures. Finally, they were able to bind one of the storage-type
magic treasures he had left behind, and they took out one item after
another from within. Ning’s group began to closely investigate
them. And as they did…all of their faces changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, crap,”
Qingqing muttered softly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having bound
Adept Mooncrescent’s storage-type magic treasure and taken the
items out, Ji Ning and his companion’s faces changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze fell upon
a blood-red robe. This blood-red robe emanated a sanguine aura, and
it had a grayish flying sword sown onto the sleeve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A battle-uniform,”
Mu Northson said softly. “This blood robe is covered with many
runes and can also serve as a construct-type magic treasure…if my
guess is correct, this should be meant to be used in unison with a
group of people who all wear this same robe. They’ll be able to
join into one entity and unleash an extremely powerful joint attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was a genius
of the Dao of constructs; he instantly discovered this. As for Ning,
although he wasn’t able to understand this as clearly as his junior
apprentice-brother did, he was skilled in formations and so was able
to discover that this war-robe was similar to a Dao-soldier’s
armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
complexity of the runes on this blood-red robe…it’s definitely
not something which an ordinary organization can produce,” Northson
said with a frown. “Sects like Snowdragon Mountain are completely
unable to produce this sort of uniform war-robe…and in fact, most
likely even my master wouldn’t be able to produce it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He had the blood
medallion of the Northmont clan,” Ning said in a low voice. “It’s
very possible that he has some sort of a connection with the
Northmont clan of Stillwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at this.”
Qingqing pointed at a leather parchment. They had removed several
leather parchments from the storage treasure. “Don’t touch them
with your hands,” Ning barked. And then, he carefully inspected the
contents on the leather scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Second Brother,
I, your brother, am going to retire as well. However, I will stay
here at the Skylands world. I don’t want to go back…there’s
nothing for me there. I’ve fought to subjugate the enemies for so
many years here in the Skylands world, that I have grown accustomed
to it. I have so many old brothers here, and I truly don’t wish to
leave. In the past, you invited me to go with you to Mount
Mooncrescent, but…forget it. If, in the future, you are free,
please come to the Skylands world…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The contents of the
leather scroll instantly made Ning’s scalp turn numb. Retired? Old
Second Brother? Skylands world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retired?” Northson
called out in shock, “Adept Mooncrescent must’ve been a member of
an army, and judging from the blood-red robe…the robe should be the
uniform which Adept Mooncrescent wore in that army! Because he was
too old and was close to the end of his life, he came back to retire
here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Second Brother?”
The Whitewater Hound spoke out as well. “Given how long this Adept
Mooncrescent had lived for, I imagine that all of his surviving
brothers must be extremely old as well, which is why they addressed
him as ‘Old Second Brother’. But this Skylands world…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skylands world…?”
Ning frowned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be one of the
trillions of lesser worlds?” Northson whispered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms were
incomparably vast, and the ordinary, common worlds were exceedingly
numerous. The worlds were divided into the three thousand major
worlds and the trillion lesser worlds. Some of the trillion lesser
worlds were naturally created by the universe, while some had been
established by major powers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Battling in the
Skylands world?” Ning mused to himself, “The blood medallion of
the Northmont clan?” Ning continued to ponder, while at the same
time, he began to carefully read the other leather scrolls. Some had
strange maps on them, while others were letters. Ning then looked at
the other items. Slowly…a hypothesis began to form in Ning’s
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northmont clan of
Stillwater must have had a secret, hidden army, with Adept
Mooncrescent having been one of the members of this army! Ning didn’t
feel surprised at the fact that the Northmont clan had a secret army
of its own, because the history of the Grand Xia Dynasty included
quite a few rebellions by Marquisates. The mere fact that Marquisates
would attempt to rebel was a testament to how powerful and how deep
their roots were. They had existed from the Fiendgod Era until the
present era; this was simply too long a stretch of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody knew exactly how
deep the roots of the Marquisates were; it was quite normal for them
to have secret armies of their own. As for the Skylands world, it
must be one of the trillion lesser worlds, or a dimension which a
major power had carved out for himself. In short, there should be
living creatures within this world, which is why it needed to be
subjugated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what should we do?” Northson said softly. “It
seems as though Adept Mooncrescent was most likely a member of a
secret army under the control of the Northmont clan of Stillwater.
And, by the looks of it, he had battled for many years for them…he
definitely must have an extremely good relationship with those
lifelong, battle-tested friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. After
battling shoulder-to-shoulder for counless years…one could imagine
how close those soldiers were! Now that Adept Mooncrescent had died
in his retirement, how could those people take it lying down?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is trouble.”
Ning frowned. Still, even if he had known Adept Mooncrescent’s
background, Ning still would’ve done the same thing. Although Adept
Mooncrescent had returned to Mount Mooncrescent to retire, he had
still proved to be a calamity for the surrounding area. Ning had
acquired quite a bit of information on Adept Mooncrescent when
reading up on Yu Dong, and the description of the Adept was…he was
a sinister, petty man who had offended many.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps because he had
so many pent up desires in the army, as soon as he had retired, he
had relied on his power to act savagely and viciously, revealing his
true nature! Ning wouldn’t show mercy to this sort of person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, what
should we do?” The Whitewater Hound looked towards Ning. “Master?”
Qingqing looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “Let’s
keep the liquefied elemental essence. We’ll put all the other
treasures into the storage treasure, and then…Qingqing, use your
Void Blink to go extremely deep underground and cast it deep into the
magnetic core.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The deep magnetic
core?” Qingqing nodded. “Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They kept only the
thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, and then discarded
everything else, including even the jade bottle which held the
essence! The liquefied elemental essence was incomparably pure and
untraceable, so they could keep it, but everything else had the
potential to prove problematic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going now.”
The little azure snake winked out of existence, passing through the
void and disappearing. Deep underground, there was a magnetic core,
and a powerful field of magnetic light that one could see with the
visible eye. Qingqing carefully threw the storage-type magic
treasure, now unbound, into the magnetic light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing returned. “I
tossed it all.” She looked at Ning, who nodded. “Good. Everyone,
let’s think it over. Have we left any clues behind?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, earlier, when we appeared at Mount
Mooncrescent…is it possible that the servants or disciples of Adept
Mooncrescent might have noticed us?” Northson said, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Don’t worry. My divine sense covered the entire Mount
Mooncrescent, and everything was within my field of observation. Only
three people accidentally saw our dragon-headed warship, but at that
time, the warship was under disguise and also had a different
coloration. There’s no way they would’ve been able to identify us
just on the basis of seeing that warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
nodded. They came here secretly, and so they had naturally disguised
the warship into a very ordinary, common-looking sort. “There’s
no way they could find us just based on the appearance of the
warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning
nodded. “Everyone, can you think of any flaws?” They all shook
their heads. They had been incomparably cautious when coming, and
hadn’t even used teleportation arrays. They had flown all the way
here, through the clouds and the mist. Only three people had seen
their true appearances at Mount Mooncrescent; Adept Mooncrescent, Yu
Dong, and Yue Wei. All three were now dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, next I am going to act against Shui Yi. There’s
no need for you to go,” Ning said. “Dealing with Shui Yi…will
be much tricker than dealing with Yu Dong. Although he’s merely a
peak Zifu Disciple, he’s within the Dong clan’s territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no ties or
attachments to be worried about. Senior apprentice-brother, don’t
say anything else,” Northson said firmly. Ning nodded gently.
“Fine, then. Still…we need to decide on how we should deal with
Shui Yi.” Ning looked around at everyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing said
hurriedly, “It’s quite simple. Master, you have divine sense…you
can effortlessly cover the entire Dong clan with it. As long as you
find a chance to kill him, you can easily kill him, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be that
easy.” Northson shook his head. “That’s the lair of the Dong
clan, and the home of a Primal Daoist. It definitely will be guarded
by numerous layers of protections, and there’s no way an outsider
will be able to silently sneak in…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Even an
idiot can guess that this place must be ringed by countless
formations. There’s no way to sneak in at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing pouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son,” the
Whitewater Hound said, “Although it might be hard for us to enter
the Dong clan to kill Shui Yi…why can’t we make Shui Yi come out
instead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have him come out?”
Ning’s eyes lit up. “Right!” Northson called out in approval as
well. Ning quickly began to ponder this, and the information he had
acquired on Shui Yi began to flash through his mind. Soon, he came up
with a way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it’s hard to go
in to kill him, then we’ll draw him out.” Ning nodded. “Find.
Then let’s go right now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, the
warship, now appearing to be an ordinary, pitch-black ship,
disappeared from the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already killed
Adept Mooncrescent. There was nothing else they could do about that
now! However, just as they were afraid of…Adept Mooncrescent’s
group of old friends wouldn’t let the matter of his death rest! The
entire Shadow Army wouldn’t let one of its old, retired brothers
die in such a manner! The members of the Shadow Army had all battled
for many years together, and too many of them had died. Very, very
few survived to retire. If even their retirees could be killed
without rhyme or reason…how could they accept this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
old brothers of our Shadow Army won’t be killed for no rhyme or
reason, just like this! In other places, the intelligence reports of
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain might be formidable, but here in
Stillwater Commandery…the intelligence reports of our Northmont
clan are even more superior!” Within the headquarters of the Shadow
Army, a red-haired old man was speaking to a group of blood-robed men
in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater Commandery
was the territory of the Northmont clan. Here, the Northmont clan’s
roots were the deepest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just half a day later….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City.
Northmont Blacktiger’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Northmont
Baiwei, who was drinking some wine and listening to music, suddenly
frowned. He heard footsteps from outside. “I’m listening to
music. Who dares disturb me?” A hint of anger could be seen in
Baiwei’s furrowed brows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the door was
pushed open, and a muscular, bald man dressed in an ornate black
uniform walked in. Next to him was a pale-faced, beardless old man
with triangular pupils. The triangle-eyed old man seemed to have a
hint of laughter on his face, but it made others shiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father!” Baiwei
shot to his feet. In the face of his father, Biawei always felt
uncontrollably nervous. “Baiwei.” Northmont Blacktiger’s deep,
hooded gaze was like an infinitely cold pool of ice. “I ask you
this - was it you who sent people to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
for an intelligence report on Yu Dong, Shui Yi, and Dong Seven?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Baiwei
nodded. “Why?” Blacktiger asked. Baiwei immediately said
respectfully, “It was for the sake of my brother, Ji Ning, who
brought his fellow disciple, Mu Northson, and asked me to assist. He
didn’t wish for the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to find out, so I
was extremely careful as well. Aside from myself and the our servants
who carried the orders out, no one else knows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Blacktiger’s
eyes were dark and cold. He said calmly, “It seems, then, that the
culprits are Ji Ning and his group.”
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The culprit is Ji
Ning?” Northmont Baiwei said, frantic, “Father, what are you
talking about? What ‘culprit’? What are you saying?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t you guess?”
Northmont Blacktiger looked at his son. This was the son who he had
entrusted all his hopes to, the one whom he had always strove to
train. If he hadn’t placed all of his hopes on Baiwei, he would’ve
left Baiwei to his own devices and let him become a carefree,
ignorant, wastrel descendant. However, Blacktiger had instead always
been very strict and exacting with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, are you
saying…” Baiwei was no fool. Frowning he said, “Brother Ji Ning
didn’t want for the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to know it was him,
so he must’ve been carrying out something he couldn’t let others
know about! He went to kill an enemy with a powerful background? Dong
Seven, Yu Dong, Shui Yi…of the three of them, the only one with a
bit of a background is Dong Seven! Can it be that he killed Dong
Seven? But Dong Seven has a mere Primal Daoist backing him; he isn’t
worthy of you, Father, acting like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger nodded. “It
isn’t Dong Seven. He killed Yu Dong.” Baiwen shook his head. “Yu
Dong? He’s just a minor figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Yudong’s
master, Adept Mooncrescent, was present at the time as well. Thus,
most likely because he tried to stop Ji Ning, he was caught up in the
fray and killed by Ji Ning as well.” Blacktiger stared at his son.
“And Adept Mooncrescent was a retired Immortal cultivator who
belonged to one of the armies under the control of our Northmont clan
of Stillwater, the Shadow Army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Baiwei’s
face instantly changed. Naturally, he knew that his own clan, the
Northmont clan, had some hidden, powerful armies of Immortal
cultivators. Every single Marquis had some armies of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty
knew this as well. However, the exact number of secret armies, how
many individuals were in each army, and how powerful the members of
the armies were…those were the true secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A retired cultivator
of the Shadow Army?” Baiwei began to mumble to himself, “A
retiree? Then he must have fought for many, many years…he must have
many old friends and brothers-in-arms. The retirees…they are the
most sensitive figures for these Immortal armies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Just so!”
Blacktiger growled, “They battle for the sake of our Northmont
clan, and countless numbers of them have perished. Very, very few are
able to survive and retire. If the retired cultivators are killed…the
cultivators of the entire army will naturally be enraged! They
absolutely will not permit this sort of event to occur, and if it
were to occur, they will find out who the killer was, then take
revenge for their old brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a sensitive,
sore spot for Immortal cultivator armies! Those who touch it will
die!” Blacktiger’s eyes were filled with solemnity as well. This
was one of the unspoken rules of the armies; they wouldn’t permit
their old, retired brethren to suffer! Absolutely not!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s group
acted very cleanly and professionally,” Blacktiger said. “The
intelligence division of the Shadow Army has begun their
investigations, they have already searched the memories of many of
the ordinary mortals who lived on Mount Mooncrescent. They’ve even
found the blood-robe which Adept Mooncrescent once wore; it had been
cast deep into the magnetic depths of the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, because a
total of three people had died, being Mooncrescent, his disciple Yu
Dong, and his daughter Yue Wei, the Shadow Army’s intelligence
division has already begun to investigate Yu Dong and Yue Wei as
well. Soon, they found that someone has recently asked the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain for a copy of the report on Yu Dong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger stared at
his son. “Following this clue, the Shadow Army’s investigations
led them to my estate; the Northmont Blacktiger Estate! That is how I
learned of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do,
then?” Baiwei was worried now. “The Shadow Army is currently
following up on several leads,” Blacktiger said, “But if Shui Yi
and Dong Seven both die as well, then the Shadow Army will definitely
grow convinced that the culprit had purchased intelligence reports on
these three figures at the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei said, frantic,
“Then I’ll immediately send someone to seek out Brother Ji Ning
and have him temporarily avoid killing Shui Yi and Dong Seven?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger shook his
head. “No use. They’ll soon be able to rule out the other leads,
at which point in time, they will make inquiries to us regarding this
matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should I
do?” Baiwei said, worried. “There are two options,” Blacktiger
said. Baiwei looked towards his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first option is
to give up Ji Ning,” Blacktiger said. “That way, we’ll avoid
all trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
Baiwei shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger, seeing
this, actually began to laugh. “Hahaha, that’s my boy. Right;
don’t easily give up or betray your good friends and brothers! If
you can so easily sacrifice them…then you’ll never be able to
make any true friends and brothers! If you wish for others to be
willing to risk their lives for you, you have to treat them with
sincerity, understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then, only the
second option remains,” Blacktiger said. “Just admit that you
were the one who did this deed.” Baiwei was astonished. “Me?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Admit to the
Shadow Army that it was you who did it; it was you who sent people to
investigate Yu Dong, and then who led people to kill Yu Dong!
However, because Adept Mooncrescent tried to stop you…you ended up
killing him as well!” Blacktiger continued, “You had no idea that
Adept Mooncrescent was a retired soldier, and thus you cannot be
faulted for what you did. There’s no way for the Shadow Army to
insist on punishing you…as a member of the main lineage of our
Northmont clan, and as someone who might become a future Marquis of
Stillwater, for you to have accidentally killed Adept Mooncrescent is
just a small matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you accept
responsibility for this matter, it will just be a small matter,
because in the end, the Shadow Army is the army of our Northmont
clan. It won’t be easy for the cultivators of our Shadow Army to
make too much trouble for a main lineage descendant of the Northmont
clan, just due to an accident.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, if anyone
else were to accept responsibility, they would almost assuredly die.”
Blacktiger looked at his son. “Still…as a result of this, I
imagine that there will be some old fellows of the Shadow Army who
will hate you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just hate me? A mere
retired Wanxiang Adept…I would be shocked if there was even a
single Loose Immortal-level cultivator who was a true friend of his!
And I imagine that very, very few will truly, deeply hate me.”
Baiwei shook his head. “For now, I don’t have anything to do with
the Shadow Army. As for Brother Ji Ning, I can tell that he’s the
sort who is willing to shoulder difficulties for his friend. I will
accept responsibility for this matter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Blacktiger
nodded. “As for how Yu Dong, Shui Yi, and Dong Seven offended you,
I’ll come up with a suitable excuse.” Baiwei nodded respectfully.
“It shall all be as you say, Father.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember!”
Blacktiger looked at his son, then said softly, “You’ve done very
well to be willing to sacrifice for your brother, but you must
remember…you need to let Ji Ning know what you did for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let him know?”
Baiwei was startled. “Right. Let him know about your sacrifice,”
Blacktiger said calmly. “You’ve paid a high price for him; if he
doesn’t even learn of it, then wouldn’t that mean that you did it
for nothing? If he were to ‘accidentally’ find out the truth of
what transpired, then he will naturally feel grateful towards you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei frowned. “Isn’t
that a bit artificial and contrived?” “Contrived?” Blacktiger
gave his son a glance. “You just need to let him find out by
‘accident’; after all, you really did take on responsibility for
his actions. Remember…although you must be sincere in taking care
of your friends, you need to be slightly strategic about it as well.
This is the principle behind using your human resources.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think about what I
have said.” Blacktiger gave his son a frowning glance. His son was
extremely intelligent, and he had high hopes for him. However, thanks
to the influence of Baiwei’s mother, he was sometimes excessively
sincere in his treatment of his friends. Although this allowed him to
make some truly good friends, a temperament like this would make it
very hard for him to truly dominate and unify a powerbase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Blacktiger said, leading the triangle-pupiled elder away with him.
The frozen atmosphere within the courtyard instantly grew calm, and
the beautiful maid who had been singing a little song nearby suddenly
came to her senses. “What, what happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t see
anything or hear anything earlier; in fact, it was as though she had
lost a portion of her memories. She just vaguely remembered the
master of the estate, Northmont Blacktiger, arriving. And then, by
the time she regained her faculties, Northmont Blacktiger was
departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strategy? Using your
human resources?” Baiwei frowned. “Father…you are calculating
towards everyone…and that’s why Mother left you. You are you. I
am myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father wanted to
train him and make him into a second Northmont Blacktiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he was Northmont
Baiwei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one and only
Northmont Baiwei!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how Ji Ning
is doing,” Baiwei worried silently to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group had
flown for half a month and had arrived at Stillwater Commandery’s
‘Dawn Bay’. Dawn Bay was roughly equivalent to Swallow Mountain
in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shui Yi’s tribe
really is puny.” A ship that was six hundred meters wide was
floating atop Dawn Bay. The Dawn River was more than a million
kilometers in length, and it was a large river that passed through
nearly half of Stillwater Commandery. Northson, atop the ship, said
with a sigh, “It actually doesn’t even have a single commandery
city!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is quite weak.”
Ning nodded. The Ji clan at least had a commandery city of the Grand
Xia Dynasty, the City of Ten Thousand Swords; being in possession of
at least one commandery city was necessary for a clan to be
considered a local hegemony. But Shui Yi’s clan, the Shui clan, was
truly puny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before Shui Yi had
appeared, their clan was an extremely ordinary, weak one. Afterwards,
Shui Yi had become a servant for the extremely large and powerful
Dong clan, and had been trained by the Dong clan until he had risen
to the Zifu Disciple level. He had also served young master Dong
Seven for a long time. Naturally, he brought prominence to his Shui
clan as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Shui Yi’s
assistance, the Shui clan slowly grew more powerful and built a city
of their own. But of course, it wasn’t a commandery city; it was
more like the Ji clan’s ‘West Prefecture City’, a self-built
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the Shui
clan was actually under the umbrella of another clan. Because Shui Yi
remained with the Dong clan, it didn’t cause any troubles for the
Shui clan, and so it continued to grow to the point where it now had
a middle-stage Zifu Disciple guarding over it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, how are you planning to draw out Shui Yi and have
him leave the Dong clan?” Northson laughed as he looked towards
Ning. “Simple.” Ning shook his head. “His clan, the Shui clan,
is too puny; the entire clan only has a single Zifu Disciple guarding
it. I have plenty of ways to send the entire Shui clan into a state
of panic and chaos! To force Shui Yi to immediately hurry back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed, he did have
many methods. The Shui clan was far too weak; whenever it encountered
any major troubles, it would immediately reach out to Shui Yi to beg
for rescue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, let’s kill
them. If we slaughter the clan, it will be sent into a state of
chaos,” Qingqing said. But Ning shook his head. “No need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Much like how when he
killed River He of the Riverside tribe, he didn’t act against River
He’s son, Ning wouldn’t act against the other members of the Shui
clan. As to the potential fall of the Shui clan with Shui Yi’s
death…Ning would just calmly watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As an Immortal
cultivator with a powerful Dao-heart, Ning was extremely confident in
his actions, and he wouldn’t act in a way that was contrary to his
Dao-heart. If, in the past, he had acted to kill River He’s son, it
would have affected his faith in his own heart and would’ve posed a
major obstacle to his path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t
attack them, how will you throw them into a state of chaos?”
Qingqing muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be quite
quick. Wait here. I’ll pay a visit and will be back in the amount
of time needed to boil a kettle of tea.” A sword-light flashed into
existence beneath Ning’s feet, and he soared through the air,
moving towards the headquarters of the Shui clan, located thousands
of kilometers away; Yishui City.
</P>

Chapter 13 - The End of the Road for Shui Yi
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yishui City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a newly
constructed city. It had been slowly built up as the Shui clan had
begun to flourish, and it was guarded by the current Patriarch of the
Shui clan, the Zifu Disciple, Shui Tianyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood atop the
clouds, staring downwards. His divine sense covered the entire city.
By now, Ning had enough power that he could’ve annihilated this
entire city, but as an Immortal cultivator…Ning didn’t dare to
massacre too many commoners. For Immortal cultivators to kill
commoners was a taboo and a grave sin! But of course, if commoners
dared to offend cultivators, cultivators could naturally punish them,
but a large-scale massacre would result in sin swirling around one’s
body…and just like Bei Zishan, invite the assaults of the
Raindragon Guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
those ten are all potentially the Patriarch of the Shui clan.”
Ning’s divine sense swept out and identified several people with
fairly powerful souls and strong auras, but he wasn’t able to
accurately ascertain their strength just by looking at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After watching for a
bit longer…“It’s him.” Ning quickly picked out the actual
Patriarch of the Shui clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Shui Tianyi was
walking across the stone path, the other clansmen were incomparably
respectful towards him, because he was the only Zifu Disciple
guarding the clan! But of course, there was also the even more
powerful ‘Shui Yi’, who was located in the distant, incomparably
powerful Dong clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These people had no
idea that the fact that they were respectfully addressing Shui Tianyi
as ‘Patriarch’ had let Ning, high above them in the skies, know
exactly who the Patriarch was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
blue-robed Shui Tianyi’s long beard billowed in the wind. He did
appear quite distinguished. Soon, he arrived at his quiet, secluded
meditation room. No servants were here, and no clansmen dared to draw
near. To his clansmen and servants, his meditation room was an
extremely mysterious place that no one would dare to disturb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. Shui Tianyi sat down in the lotus position, his eyelids
drooping. “My Shui clan is increasingly flourishing. The liquefied
elemental essence which Elder Yi has delivered us has allowed our
clan to produce three more peak Xiantian experts. If one of them were
to break through to the Zifu level, that would be wonderful. Our Shui
clan currently has too few Zifu Disciples!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Patriarch of a
tribe, Shui Tianyi held a deep desire to let his tribe grow stronger.
Their current status was simply too awkward. Weak? They did have Zifu
Disciples. Strong? They didn’t even have a single commandery city!
An awkward status like this naturally caused Shui Tianyi and ‘Elder
Yi’, these two Zifu Disciples, to rack their brains for methods for
strengthening their tribes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Endure for now.”
Shui Tianyi still remembered the words which Elder Shui Yi had told
him. “Tianyi, don’t be impatient. Take things one step at a time.
The roots of our tribe are simply too shallow…if we are too
impatient, we might be viewed with hostility by the other great
powers in the Dawn Bay region, at which point, we might be in danger
of being annihilated. We need to be patient and slowly wait. Since I
am with the Dong clan, the other powers of the Dawn Bay region won’t
launch a war against us. When we have more Zifu Disciples in the
tribe, I will bring over some of my good friends from the Dong clan
and establish a base and foundation for our Shui clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Shui Yi has
sacrificed far too much for our tribe,” Shui Tianyi said with a
silent sigh. It was only because Shui Yi had willingly entered the
Dong clan as a servant that he had been able to slowly help the Shui
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Shui Tianyi
suddenly felt a powerful collision against his soul. BOOM! Everything
in the world instantly went dark. A sword-light flashed past,
piercing through the roof of the private room, and a figure entered
the room. Ning stood there in the room, a white sack having appeared
out of nowhere into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in!” Ning
opened the bag, and the bag instantly unleashed a powerful, wild
sucking power. Whooooooosh. The sucking power was so great that the
nearby plates and utensils were all drawn in. As for the dazed and
completely defenseless Shui Tianyi, he too was drawn directly into
the sack. This sack was known as the ‘one-breath sack’, and was
only a Mortal-ranked magic treasure. The sack possessed a sucking
power that could drawn objects into it, and although it didn’t seem
to be larger, it could store quite a few meters worth of objects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sack wasn’t able
to be used to actually attack others. Only when enemies were
completely helpless would they be absorbed into it. To put it simply,
this was used to store people! It was impossible to breathe within
the ‘one-breath sack’, and so ordinary people who were drawn into
it would all suffocate to death. Xiantian lifeforms and above,
however, would be fine even if they couldn’t breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
immediately tied the sack off with a rope. Then, with a wave of his
hand, he sent out a powerful surge of strength from his
Fiendgod-enhanced arms, smashing directly against the wooden table
and blasting it apart in an explosion of sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
The large sack over his shoulders, Ning transformed into a streak of
light, moving towards the hole he had created moments earlier,
charging into the heavens and disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people outside were
naturally able to hear the explosive sounds which came from within
the private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A streak of light
seemed to soar into the skies, just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The Xiantian experts of the Shui clan all
hurried over, moving so fast as to appear like blurs. Quite a few of
them saw the streak of light soar into the skies, moving so fast that
they could only vaguely tell that it was human-shaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast…it should
have been an Immortal cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A cultivator flew
out from the Patriarch’s private room?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them began to
panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, there’s a
giant hole in the roof of the private room.” The Xiantian lifeforms
who had reached this place first had flown in at a high enough angle
that they could immediately see the large hole in the private room’s
ceiling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They each leapt into
that giant hole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shui clan was truly
too weak. The strongest member of the clan, Shui Yi, was merely a
servant for the Dong clan, and so only the Patriarch’s private room
was made of decent materials. Ordinary Xiantian lifeforms wouldn’t
be able to break through the room, but Zifu Disciples generally would
be able to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The private rooms of
the formal disciples of the Black-White College, by comparison,
couldn’t be broken into by even the likes of Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’s the
Patriarch?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a disaster
zone inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The table has been
smashed, and the roof was broken apart, and the Patriarch is gone.”
The entire Shui clan was instantly thrown into a state of panic. The
very first thing they did was to go investigate the Patriarch’s
life-tablet in the ancestral hall. When they did, they let out sighs
of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch’s
life-tablet is intact. The Patriarch isn’t dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But why has the
Patriarch gone missing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which Immortal
cultivator attacked him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shui clan remained
restless and uneasy. Their most powerful cultivator, the Patriarch,
had gone missing; how could they not be uneasy? At this point in
time, they thought of the most powerful member of their clan; Elder
Yi, also known as Shui Yi, who was a servant within the Dong clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, ask Elder Yi
to come back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, ask for Elder
Yi to return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in the clouds
above, held the one-breath sack over his shoulder as he inspected the
below area with his divine sense. “As I thought, they have gone to
ask Shui Yi to come.” Ning revealed a smile on his face. “However,
from here to the Snowcloud Fields of the Dong clan is quite far. It
will take anywhere from half a month to one or two months.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at the one-breath sack on his shoulder. “This fellow is a Zifu
Disciple. He’ll survive a month or two being trapped inside this
sack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shui clan had
immediately shattered an insignia, causing Shui Yi, located in the
distant Dong clan, to be greatly shocked. He knew that something
major must have occurred within his clan, as otherwise, they wouldn’t
have shattered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to go back
right away.” Shui Yi instantly applied for a leave of absence from
the high-level members of the Dong clan. As a peak Zifu Disciple, he
was naturally no ordinary servant, and could be said to have some
status within the clan…a leave of absence to pay a visit to his
home was a small matter. The high level members of the Dong clan had
naturally nodded in approval. That very day, Shui Yi had embarked on
a return trip back to his clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly half a month
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a hundred
kilometers away from Yishui City, atop a wild, untamed, forested
mountain, there was a beautiful estate. This was Northson’s
construct-estate, and it was covered by formations that ensured that
commoners and Xiantian experts would have no chance of discovering
it. Ning’s group, for now, took up residence within this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, would Shui
Yi perhaps not return?” Qingqing said, worried. Ning shook his
head. “This is his tribe, and he is the most powerful member of it.
How can he not come back?” Aside from a very small minority of
figures who had been humiliated by their tribes, most members of a
tribe who had grown up within it would feel a powerful sense of
belonging to their tribes. This was part of the law of survival in
this vast world. If one wanted to live a good life, the entire tribe
would have to be incomparably unified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One generation after
another would do battle for the sake of the tribe; this had become a
form of faith for the countless tribesmen. Even those who weren’t
truly infatuated with and loyal to their tribes would generally
return when the tribe was in trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” A flash of
sword-light suddenly appeared in Ning’s eyes. The nearby
white-robed Uncle White glanced towards Ning as well. “He’s
back?” Ning nodded. “He’s back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Uncle
White couldn’t resist any longer as well, and Ning nodded. “Right.”
Swoosh! Swoosh! Ning and Uncle White soared into the skies, quickly
moving towards Shui Yi, who was currently hastening back towards
Yishui City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll follow them
as well.” Northson and Qingqing immediately transformed into
streaks of light, following after them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair. A green,
leaf-type magic treasure was soaring through the skies, with a
gray-robed Daoist standing atop it. Shui Yi had a black birthmark on
his face, and he always bore a smile, which gave him a rather crafty,
sly look. However, a sly, craft person like him…had been able to
claw his way to increasingly greater heights within the vast Dong
clan, and rise from becoming a servant to a peak Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, in addition
to from those who had truly formidable backgrounds, the Immortal
cultivators who had clawed their way up the ladder, one step at a
time, could not be underestimated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly
happened? Why did they break the seal and ask for me to return? Even
Tianyi couldn’t handle this matter?” Shui Yi, till this very
moment, had no idea what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.” Shui
Yi could already see the distant Yishui City. The reason why Yishui
City was named Yishui was precisely because the entire clan wanted to
express its gratitude to him, Shui Yi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.” Just as
Shui Yi controlled his green leaf-type magic treasure to soar down
from the clouds, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! A streak of
light suddenly flew past, blocking his way. “Eh?” Shui Yi’s
face changed. Just as he was about to reach Yishui City, another
cultivator had come to bar his way? Shui Yi instantly sensed danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He took a close look.
Standing in the air opposite from him was a fur-clad youth and a
white-robed man. The white-robed man appeared to be the fur-clad
youth’s servant or housekeeper. The fur-clad youth just stood
there, staring at Shui Yi, his eyes as cold as ice. He said in an icy
voice, “So you are Shui Yi?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_14___Return_to_Serpentwi"></A>
Chapter 14 - Return to Serpentwing Lake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Shui Yi
was secretly shocked; he could sense that both the fur-clad youth and
the white-robed steward by his side both posed a serious threat to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sensation came
from the killing intent that filled the hearts of Ning and Uncle
White. Shui Yi could sense it, and thus his heart was filled with
dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Shui Yi. Given
that the two of you have stopped me, I imagine that you already know
who I am.” Shui Yi looked at the two of them. “I imagine that you
two also expected that I would hurry back here from the distant Dong
clan. Our Shui tribe is a small one, and it isn’t overly ambitious;
if there’s anything you want, just go ahead and tell me. As long as
I can accomplish it…naturally, I won’t decline.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words were simple,
but at the same time, he not only issued a threat via his backers,
the Dong clan, he also assumed a humble attitude. In an ordinary
power struggle, this would be enough for the two sides to enter a
negotiation. However…this wasn’t a power struggle. This was
revenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want you…”
Ning suddenly moved as he executed the Windwing Evasion, and a
flashing sword-light stabbed directly through Shui Yi’s chest. Shui
Yi wanted to dodge, and in fact, he even sent a few flying swords in
front of him, but the difference in power between them was too
great…in terms of power or in terms of the Dao, the difference was
too great. In a single exchange, Shui Yi’s chest was pierced
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you!” Shui
Yi stared. His flying swords fell down from midair, and multiple
magic treasures spilled out next to him. Although his storage-type
magic treasure remained with him, it was now an ownerless item,
because his Zifu had been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You destroyed my
Zifu…” Shui Yi couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll take these.”
Ning waved his hand, collecting all of the magic treasures, then
turned to stare coldly at Shui Yi. Although his Zifu had been
destroyed, Shui Yi still stood there in midair, not sinking down at
all…because an enormous Waterflame Lotus had bloomed beneath him,
and Shui Yi was standing right on top of it, at its center. The lotus
wasn’t swiveling; naturally, it contained no killing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you destroy
my Zifu. I…I don’t even know you.” Shui Yi was stupefied. This
sudden calamity was beyond his ability to comprehend. “Who exactly
are you? Who are you!!!” Shui Yi’s face began to twist and
distort. With his Zifu destroyed, his Immortal path had been severed;
he would have no more hopes for advancement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shui Yi, do you
recognize me?” The nearby Uncle White transformed into mist, and
then reformed into a snowy white dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Godbeast,
Whitewater Hound?” When Shui Yi saw it, memories from twenty-plus
years ago suddenly flooded his mind. These were memories from back
when he followed young master Dong Seven. Back then, he had done all
sorts of dastardly deeds with Dong Seven, but he had been completely
fearless, because the young master would be able to deal with any
repercussions. That truly was an enjoyable period of time for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, he and Yu
Dong had received orders to go capture a woman…but that woman’s
elder brother and husband had used forbidden arts, frantically trying
to block them. At that time, a snowy white dog had carried the woman
away and fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you are that
Whitewater Hound?” Shui Yi looked at Ji Ning. “And you, you
are…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those people you
acted against were my uncle, my father, and my mother!” Ning stared
at him, the cold look in his eyes causing Shui Yi’s heart to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are that child
the woman was pregnant with?” Shui Yi stared. Good heavens. It was
only twenty or so years. The child that woman was pregnant with had
become this powerful? Could it be that the woman was pregnant with a
reincarnated Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” With but a
thought, Ning sent the elemental ki surging from his body, forming
into a glowing rune that appeared in front of him. It was the
Heartburner Art. The shining runic seal instantly merged into Shui
Yi’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enjoy this,” Ning
said with cold emotionlessness. Shui Yi instantly let out an agonized
scream. His flesh and his bones began to twist and distort, and his
skin turned completely red. The agony was causing him to scream in
pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill me, kill me!”
Heartrending roars rang out from Shui Yi’s mouth, but Ning just
watched him calmly. “KILL ME!” Shui Yi bellowed. “Make it clean
and fast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clean and fast? If I
granted you your wish, who would come and grant me mine? Can you let
my parents come back to life? Let my uncle come back to life?” Ning
stared at him coldly. Shui Yi’s flesh was beginning to char, and
his eyes had turned completely red. This was hell itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I curse you, I curse
you. You’ll die a miserable death, a miserable death!” Utterly
agonized, Shui Yi stared death at Ning, filled with a towering rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle, crackle,
crackle…his body began to actually flicker with flames as it began
to burn…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning produced the
incense burner magic treasure. “In you go!” A soul was directly
absorbed into the incense burner, then was corroded and destroyed.
Ning then waved his hand, collecting all of the magic treasures that
remained in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, previously
incomparably icy, suddenly turned calm. Only, a very complicated look
remained in his eyes. “Two are dead,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, your
father and your mother never would have imagined that two out of the
three culprits would have died in your hands so quickly.” Uncle
White stood there to one side, gently patting Ning on the shoulders.
“If they knew, they would definitely feel very gratified.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last one, Dong
Seven, remains. However, he’s at Snowdragon Mountain. That’s the
headquarters of a school; even Loose Immortals would be cautious
about charging into it. I have no chance at all, right now,” Ning
said softly. “I’ll wait. I’ll let Dong Seven live for a bit
longer, but when the time comes, I’ll destroy his soul as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Revenge. Naturally, he
wouldn’t give them a chance at all. These enemies were all Immortal
cultivators with extremely powerful souls. Generally speaking, after
they died and went to the Netherworld Kingdom, they could cooperate
and become ghost soldiers, and eventually train to become Ghost
Immortals. Ning wouldn’t permit this to occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. The
others have been waiting quite a while,” Uncle White said. Ning
turned his head and saw the distant Mu Northson and Little Qing. They
clearly didn’t want to disturb Ning as he was taking revenge, and
so simply had watched from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It’s time
to go back.” Next, Ning released Shui Tianyi. They were no grudges
between them; given Ning’s proud disposition, he wouldn’t stoop
to massacring this man. However, with Shui Yi’s death, in the
future, the entire Shui clan would definitely begin to decay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the Crimson Dragon
Mountains, the headquarters of the Raindragon Guard, not too far away
from Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson both
handed in their missions. “With these ten karmic points, we’ll
have a hundred years of leisure.” Northson looked towards Ning.
“Senior apprentice-brother, where are you planning to go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I plan to go home,”
Ning said. “I will probably stay permanently at Serpentwing Lake in
my homeland, Swallow Mountain. I’ll occasionally go out and do some
adventuring, but most of the time, I’ll be staying at Swallow
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That place was his
home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That place had the
people he was most familiar with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That place had the
underwater estate which would be of great use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And similarly…it had
been a long, long time since he had drifted about on a small boat on
Serpentwing Lake, and enjoyed that feeling, that truly warm
sensation, of being in the embrace of his father and his mother. He
missed that sort of feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back to Serpentwing
Lake?” Northson paused for a moment, then said, “Senior
apprentice-brother, then I’ll part with you for a time. I want to
focus on analyzing the Dao of Constructs…I am going to return to
the school. My master has reached an extremely deep level of
understanding regarding the Dao of Constructs, and being with her is
of great help to me. In addition, Master is close to the end of her
life; I want to spend some time with her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
this junior apprentice-brother of his truly viewed Daoist Jadefine
with affection, almost like the affection a son felt for a mother.
After all, his actual mother had long since passed away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “Let’s split up for now. If you are free in the future,
you can come to Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When the time
comes, I’ll definitely go to visit you, senior apprentice-brother,”
Northson said with a nod. And then, Northson rode his dragon-headed
warship into the skies, flying straight towards Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
watched as his junior apprentice-brother left. Then, he turned to
Little Qing and Uncle White. “Let’s go.” They walked towards
the Crimson Dragon Mountain’s teleportation array. This place was
rather far away from Swallow Mountain, and going through the array
would be somewhat faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain. The
mountains were the same mountains; the water was the same water. A
ship was soaring through its skies, and aboard it was a fur-clad
youth, a large, snowy white hound, and also a little azure snake, the
latest addition to the party.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re back.” As
Ning stared at the sight of his homeland, he revealed a hint of a
smile on his face. “When I left, it was winter, and white snow
covered the entire place. Upon my return…it is still the cold
winter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had left the
Black-White College and joined the Raindragon Guard, it had been the
middle of summer. However, after the trials at the wild marshes of
the Gaol Mountains, the pursuit of criminal suspects, and the killing
of Yu Dong and Shui Yi, it was already the middle of winter. The
ground below was covered with silver-white decorations of snow.
Swallow Mountain was a cold place to begin with, and in the winter,
it was almost completely covered in snow. When Ning was born, the
world was covered in snow as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing Lake.”
The Whitewater Hound suddenly spoke in the human tongue. “We’re
here.” Ning, too, stared at the vast Serpentwing Lake. Although
snow had built up on the banks of the lake, the waters of the
seemingly endless lake continued to flow forth in waves. A lake of
this size…even in the coldest of temperatures, it would very rarely
be completely frozen over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing Lake.”
Upon seeing the lake, Ning felt a surge of warmth. His mother’s
ashes…his father’s ashes…they had all been sprinkled into the
waters of this lake. The boat drifted downwards from the skies,
landing in the middle of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
Ning looked towards the lake, then revealed a smile. “I’m back.
Of our three enemies, your son was only strong enough to kill two of
them for now. One of them is awaiting his turn. He, too, will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White. I’m
going to sleep for a time,” Ning said. The Whitewater Hound nodded.
Ning then lay down on the boat, feeling incomparably relaxed and
comfortable. The boat drifted atop the surface of the lake. It felt
so very wonderful, far more so than sleeping on a bed. The gentle
rocking movements of the boat stop the waters of the lake…it felt
like how, when he was an infant, his mother had constantly cradled
him in her arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The boat slowly rocked
forward, a Whitewater Hound lying on one side of it, and with a
little azure serpent wrapped around Ning’s wrist, snuggly nestled
against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the boat
floated towards the center, towards Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sundown. Only now did
the boat draw close to the shores of Brightheart Island. Ning could
sense the auras of the many people living on the island, and he
naturally rose to his feet. As he rose to his feet, he saw the
distant snowbanks, and a white-robed woman standing within them,
staring towards him, unable to disguise the tears within her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf!” Ji
Ning revealed a smile on his face. “I’m back.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_15___The_Rise_of_the_Ji"></A>
Chapter 15 - The Rise of the Ji Clan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf’s eyes flashed with tears, but these were the tears of
joy. Ning laughed as well. It had been so long since he had seen
Autumn Leaf. Since he was a child, the closest to him had been his
father, his mother, Uncle White, Spring Grass, and Autumn Leaf. His
parents and Spring Grass had all passed away, leaving behind only
Uncle White and Autumn Leaf. Ning knew that what he felt for Autumn
Leaf wasn’t romantic love; it was a sort of familial love.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four years. Autumn
Leaf, you haven’t changed much at all. You should’ve broken
through to become a Xiantian lifeform.” Ning walked over to her.
Autumn Leaf hurriedly wiped her tears away, then said, “It was all
thanks to the medicines that you left behind, young master; they
helped me to break through to the Xiantian level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t feel the
slightest bit surprised by the fact that Autumn Leaf had made a
breakthrough, because as someone who had been selected to be his
personal handmaiden, she was naturally quite talented. With the help
of the medicines he had left behind for her, Autumn Leaf did indeed
have a very high chance of becoming a Xiantian lifeform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you been well,
these past four years?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been alright.
Brightheart Island is the same as it always has been, while the Ji
clan has been growing more and more powerful,” Autumn Leaf said.
“After that battle, Snowdragon Mountain’s forces in the Swallow
Mountain region grew much weaker. Although they sent three more Zifu
Disciples to be stationed at the Swallow Mountain branch, after news
spread that you joined the Black-White College, young master, the
Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain no longer dared to
cause trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. In terms
of power, since the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain
had the support of the main Snowdragon Mountain sect, it had far more
experts and a much deeper base of strength than the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning joined
the Black-White College. When Northmont Baiwei had sent people to
Swallow Mountain to collect and harvest the elemental ore mines, he
had also sent messengers to inform the Ji clan that Ning had joined
the Black-White College. Once this news spread, the Ji clan’s
reputation instantly soared to unprecedented heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens. The
Black-White College! To the powers located in the Swallow Mountain
region, the Black-White College was an incomparably massive behemoth
that was far beyond their level. According to legend, every single
person admitted to the Black-White College was a supreme, peerless,
monstrous genius. Even Snowdragon Mountain, despite its grudge
against Ji Ning, had to temporarily stay their hand and let go of
their hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And Bluestone?”
Ning asked. “Bluestone.” Autumn Leaf turned and called his name
out, and a tall, muscular youth ran towards them from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. What
a tall, muscular fellow! The man was at least 1.9 meters tall, even
taller than Ning himself. When Ning had left, Bluestone had been a
mere youngster, but after four years…he’d actually grown so tall!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother.”
Bluestone walked over. “Why were you hiding over there?” Ning
laughed as he ‘reprimanded’ Bluestone. He had watched Bluestone
grow up from his toddler years, and had long since come to view
Bluestone as his own little brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone chortled. “I
wanted to let Big Sister Autumn Leaf and you, Big Brother, have a
private meeting, alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf instantly
stared at him. As for Ning, he just laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, why do
you have a snake around your arm?” Bluestone saw the little azure
snake wrapped around Ning’s wrist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing,” Ning
called out. Whoosh; the little azure snake instantly transformed into
mist, and then reformed into an azure-robed maiden. Even Autumn Leaf
was shocked, and as for the nearby Bluestone, he actually jumped. “A
monster! A Diremonster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a Wanxiang
Diremonster! A peak Wanxiang Diremonster!” Qingqing raised her head
and spoke smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Wanxiang
Diremonster?” Bluestone blinked. Although Ning had originally left
behind some pills and treasures for him, in terms of talent,
Bluestone was somewhat inferior to even Autumn Leaf. Although Autumn
Leaf had already become a Xiantian lifeform, Bluestone remained
unable to break through, and was still at the Houtian stage. However,
he knew about the major levels of Immortal cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Peak Wanxiang? Our
Patriarch of the Ji clan seems to only be a Zifu Disciple.”
Bluestone looked towards the azure-robed maiden, unable to believe
that this was someone who could easily crush the Patriarch of the Ji
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Little
Qing was originally an Azure Skysnake who lived in the Swallow
Mountains. Afterwards, fate brought us together in the wild marshes
of the Gaol Mountains, and so she accompanied me and became my
spirit-beast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your spirit-beast,
Big Brother?” Bluestone let out a sigh of relief, then asked with
curiosity, “Big Brother, are you at the peak Wanxiang level yet?”
“Late Wanxiang level, a bit weaker than Little Qing,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Master’s
only at the late Wanxiang level, I’m far from being his match.”
Qingqing lowered her head and said, “Master…he’s a real
monster, even more of a monster than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf and
Bluestone were both delighted and surprised. Autumn Leaf then looked
at the Whitewater Hound behind Ning. “Uncle White, you…” “Uncle
White is also at the late Wanxiang level,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…”
Autumn Leaf instantly realized how, despite only a few years having
passed, her young master had improved at an utterly astonishing rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
began to speak in the human tongue. “Monsters train much more
slowly, and many monsters will take thousands of years to go from the
Zifu level to the Wanxiang level, and tens of thousands of years to
go from the Wanxiang level to the Primal level…although I reached
the necessary level of insights long ago, in terms of accumulated
elemental ki, I had needed to accumulate much more. Fortunately, Ning
helped me, and thus I very quickly reached the Wanxiang level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Wanxiang
experts.” Bluestone was full of delight and excitement. “The
other powers of Swallow Mountain don’t even have a single Wanxiang
Adept amongst their ranks, but our Ji clan has suddenly gained three.
This is too…too…ahahaha, we’re going to be invincible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master’s
formidable, but you aren’t. He gave you excellent techniques,
excellent masters, and various treasures and spirit-pills…but you
still have yet to become a Xiantian lifeform. When the young master
was your age, he was able to effortlessly kill Zifu Disciples,”
Autumn Leaf scolded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I compare to
Big Brother? In terms of cultivating, I can’t even compare to you,
Big Sister Autumn Leaf,” Bluestone shook his head. Autumn Leaf
scolded him angrily, “You don’t work hard, and you always make
excuses for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
actually felt a strong, warm feeling surge into his heart. It was
just like before; Autumn Leaf also treated Bluestone as she would her
own little brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had returned.
The unparalleled genius, the disciple of Black-White College, Ji
Ning. He had come back to Swallow Mountain. This news quickly stunned
the entire Ji clan, and the members of the clan celebrated and danced
for joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the likes of
Patriarch Ji Ninefire, Ji Young, Ji Redflower, and the others,
including the most outstanding youths the Ji clan had produced in
recent years…they all made their way to Brightheart Island of
Serpentwing Lake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a Wanxiang
serpent monster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Whitewater Hound
has become a Wanxiang Diremonster as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch and the
others, upon arriving, were all astonished. They weren’t too
surprised by the fact that Ning had become a Wanxiang Adept, as Ji
Ning had been able to easily slay the Wanxiang Adept, Xu Li, in the
past. In addition, Ji Ning had entered the legendary Black-White
College; in their hearts, for a monster like Ji Ning to improve so
rapidly was perfectly normal. If he trained as slowly as they did,
that would be quite surprising.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch,” Ning
said, “Recently, I joined the Raindragon Guard.” The nearby
Ninefire, Granny Shadow, Ji Truekeep, and Young all revealed looks of
surprise on delight on their normally calm faces. They didn’t know
that Ning had recently joined the Raindragon Guard; however, they
weren’t at all surprised by the fact that he was strong enough to
join them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After joining the
Raindragon Guard, I was granted the authority to designate a region
of ten thousand kilometers to be protected by the Raindragon Guard!
Even if I were to die in the future, this land would still be
protected by the Raindragon Guard for a thousand years. The region I
designated has the City of Ten Thousand Swords at the center, and the
other four prefectural cities included within it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s the
talisman.” Ning took out a talisman, then said, “Only Zifu
Disciples can bind it. After doing so, hang it above the gates of the
Lord Prefect’s residence at the City of Ten Thousand Swords. When
you do so, the entire city’s walls will have a vague outline of a
Raindragon appear. Others will instantly know that this place is
under the protection of the Raindragon Guard, and they won’t dare
to invade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire accepted the
talisman with incomparable excitement. “This will be the foundation
of our clan, the foundation of our clan! With this talisman, our
clan’s base will be even more secure, and our Ji clan will
definitely flourish and grow!” The nearby Truekeep and others were
all filled with anticipation and eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, how long
will you remain, this time?” Ninefire asked. “In the future,”
Ning said, “I’ll permanently live here at Serpentwing Lake. I’ll
occasionally go out and take on some missions for the Raindragon
Guard, and also occasionally pay a visit to my master at the
Black-White College of Stillwater City. The rest of the time, I
should be here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
students of the Black-White College who always stayed at the College.
This was because the college had the Black-White Diagram, and because
they could often discuss the Dao with their fellow disciples. Ning,
however, was different. First of all, Immortal Diancai only
occasionally provided guidance to him. As for the Black-White
Diagram? It wasn’t of too much benefit to Ning, as it would be
enough for him to just go view it occasionally. This was because Ning
had the underwater estate, which was even better. The Stellar Hall of
the underwater estate was far more formidable than the Black-White
Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whether for the sake of
the clan, or because of the underwater estate, or for the sake of the
calmness of his own soul, Ning would choose to remain at Serpentwing
Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Good!”
Ninefire, overjoyed, said hurriedly, “It won’t affect your
training, will it? No matter what, training as an Immortal is of
paramount concern.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will not,” Ning
shook his head. “Good.” Ninefire nodded repeatedly. “With you
here long-term, Ji Ning, and with two Wanxiang Diremonsters…our Ji
clan’s power will grow exponentially. With this additional power,
our Ji clan will flourish still further, and our territory will
grow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Three
Wanxiang Adepts, and with Ning possibly being a Primal Daoist in the
future! The territory our Ji clan has is too small.” Granny Shadow,
Ji Truekeep, and the others all began to grow excited. The larger
one’s stomach was, the more food one could eat. In the past, the Ji
clan’s power was limited, and so they naturally didn’t dare to
desire too much. But now that Ji Ning was so powerful, and now that
he had two Wanxiang Diremonsters, and had the support of the
Black-White College? Given their power, the Ji clan was naturally
going to flourish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do as you see fit.”
Ning agreed, because this had been his father’s hope as well. “If
you run into any trouble…Little Qing, Uncle White, the two of you
need to give them a hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me,”
Qingqing said confidently. “Swallow Mountain only has us three
Wanxiang Adepts; doesn’t that mean we’ll be able to do whatever
the hell we want?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ninefire
and the others all began to roar with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s decision to
stay at Serpentwing Lake sent excitement throughout the Ji clan. Ning
also gave some guidance to some of the more promising new talents of
the Ji clan. However, these so-called talents could only be
considered talents in the Swallow Mountain region; none of them truly
astonished Ning. Ning soon understood that the fellow disciples he
usually interacted with were all members of the Black-White
College…how could the ‘geniuses’ of a small clan such as the Ji
clan compare with them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reuniting with his clan
members. Providing guidance to his juniors. After three days, things
at Brightheart Island finally calmed down. Only now did Ning enter
his private study room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The underwater
estate.” With but a thought, Ning manifested an enormous phantom of
a grizzly bear’s head within his private room. The phantom bear had
a hint of a smile on its face. Opening its mouth, it swallowed Ning
into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disappeared from
the private room. He had returned to the ‘underwater estate’,
located in a different dimension.

was the same as it had been in the past. Those giant prayer mats
remained in the same positions as they had for trillions of years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning materialized out
of nowhere within this main hall. He instantly saw an old black bull
and a giant yellow bear, and he hurriedly said with respect, “Ji
Ning greets you two, seniors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Late Wanxiang
stage?” The giant yellow bear nodded slightly. “You’ve improved
quite quickly as a Ki Refiner, but you have only reached the ninth
stage as a Fiendgod. You are a bit slower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Already at the
Wanxiang level?” The old black bull was quite surprised. He looked
at Ning. “Ji Ning, kiddo, it seems as though you are already much
more powerful than our fourth master, Rampart. Rampart died at the
Wanxiang level, you know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just grinned. As
for the giant yellow bear, he nodded. “Ji Ning is naturally much
more powerful than Rampart; his talent is comparable to a
reincarnated Immortal’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much, senior,” Ning said with a laugh. Naturally, he felt quite
pleased at being praised. “I wonder how much of a chance I would
currently have at challenging the third level of the Wargod Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than ten
percent.” The giant yellow bear shook his head. “What?!” Ning
was shocked. When he had left Swallow Mountain and gone to Stillwater
City, he had already successfully passed the second level of the
Wargod Hall. In the past four years, he had only grown more powerful
as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and had embarked on the path of the Dao
of the Sword…and yet the spirit of the estate, the giant yellow
bear, was actually saying with great certainty that he had less than
a ten percent change of passing the third level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, you don’t
even know what level I have reached in the sword,” Ning protested.
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “Ji Ning, you don’t
understand. The first and second levels of the Wargod Hall, upon
being completed, result in rewards of Mortal-ranked magic treasures
or items of comparable value. But the third and fourth levels, when
completed, will resulted in you acquiring Earth-ranked magic
treasures or items of comparable value…in short, after every two
levels of the Wargod Hall, the difficulty skyrockets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyrockets?” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The first and
second levels of the Wargod Hall are generally meant to be a test for
Fiendgods who have reached the Zifu level. The third and fourth
levels, however, are meant for Fiendgods who have reached the
Wanxiang level.” The giant yellow bear looked towards Ning.
“Generally speaking, only when Fiendgods have reached the Wanxiang
level will they have a chance at passing the third level of the
Wargod Hall. You are only at the ninth stage of the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; your fundamentals are, by comparison,
far too weak. Although you have divine abilities, the test has
already accounted for them as well; these are tests meant for the
heirs of Master, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example, the
seventh and eighth levels of the Wargod Hall are meant to test
Fiendgods who have reached the Void level of power. In the past,
Immortal Juhua had remained unable to break through as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner, and so although he did break through as a Ki Refiner,
and he even reached the peak of the Void level as a Ki Refiner, he
was still unable to pass the seventh level. Only after he trained for
many years and became a Loose Immortal was he able to pass the
seventh level…from this, you should be able to imagine how
difficult it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded silently.
Right. Immortal Juhua, even as a peak Void-level Ki Refiner, was
unable to pass the seventh level. Thus, for a peak Wanxiang-level Ki
Refiner to pass the third level would be similarly difficult. One had
to have the finest Fiendgod Body Refining techniques, a high level of
insight into the Dao, and and a divine ability like the [Starseizing
Hand], or one of the other top three divine abilities in the Divine
Abilities Hall, in order to be able to pass it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the trials
left behind by Daoist Threelives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, you
can try if you want,” the giant yellow bear said. “At the Zifu
level, as a Fiendgod, you have two chances to challenge the Wargod
Hall. You’ve only used one; you have one more!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “No
rush. The main reason I’ve come is to go visit the Stellar Hall.”
The old black bull said hurriedly, “Let me take you there. The
Wargod Hall is extremely difficult; in the past, it drove Immortal
Juhua nearly insane. The Stellar Hall is much better; it is
completely filled with the mysteries of the Dao, and is a sacred
place for comprehending it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
followed them from behind. A bull, a man, and a bear. They walked
together towards the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Stellar
Hall. The giant mountain remained there, filled with green, verdant
life. Beneath that mountain, the stones remained strewn about wildly,
with a thatched straw hut in the mist of them. The sky was still
filled with those countless, sparkling stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time I come, I
have a different feeling.” Ning looked towards the stream of water
which flowed atop some of the rocks, then towards the wild grass that
grew amidst them. He stared at the stars in the sky, each of which
made him feel extremely aware of the profundity of the Dao. “That
one is the Dao of the Inferno. That one is…the Dao of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
giving it a look. “The Dao of the Sword?!” Ning couldn’t help
but let out a startled cry. The nearby old black bull gave him a
surprised glance. “You’ve embarked onto the Dao of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Right.
After leaving Swallow Mountain, I went to Stillwater City. Shortly
after I entered the Black-White College, I embarked on the Dao of the
Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, Juhua
embarked on the Dao of the Sword as well. Immortal Juhua was an
extremely famous Sword Immortal…unfortunately, he wasn’t able to
completely comprehend the Dao of the Sword.” The old black bull
shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the Sword
is one of the Grand Daos.” The giant yellow bear walked towards
them from behind, then said leisurely, “If you have the heart of a
Sword Immortal, a heart which is sincere to the sword, and a high
level of comprehension, you’ll generally be able to embark on the
Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning muttered to
himself. It was easy for the bear to say that, but in the entire
Black-White College, aside from his master, Ning was the only person
to embark on the Dao of the Sword. It seemed, however, as though the
bear viewed it as quite a simple matter. Still…the spirit of the
estate had previously followed Daoist Threelives, a Primordial
Fiendgod. It only made sense that he had a broader view of things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s easy to
embark on the Dao of the Sword, and it’s also not too hard to be
fairly accomplished in it. However, to comprehend the entire Dao of
the Sword…that is incomparably difficult.” The giant yellow bear
looked towards Ning. “In your homeland, this world which has been
unified by the Grand Xia Dynasty, there probably isn’t a single
person who has comprehended the entire Dao of the Sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. He
continued to listen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser Daos are
lesser Daos. Grand Daos are Grand Daos. Heavenly Daos are Heavenly
Daos!” The giant yellow bear let out a sigh. “The differences
between the three are tremendous. Immortal Juhua had comprehended
nine complete Dao-Paths, but even if you gave him another ten million
years, he still wouldn’t be able to completely comprehend a
complete Grand Dao! My master, a Primordial Fiendgod, was born from
the primordial chaos with innate mastery over an entire Grand Dao!
Afterwards, he comprehended quite a few complete Grand Daos, and many
ordinary Daos…but unfortunately, up till the day he built this
estate, he still remained unable to master a Heavenly Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ears pricked
up. Daoist Threelives? He was born from the primordial chaos with
innate mastery over a Grand Dao? And had mastered many Grand Daos?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slowly enlighten
yourself. Your talent is far greater than Juhua’s. Only by
comprehending a complete Grand Dao will you have a chance at becoming
a major power who can roam freely about the Three Realms. Only then
will you have a chance at becoming comparable to your master, Daoist
Threelives.” The giant yellow bear looked towards Ning. “In this
major world controlled by the Grand Xia Dynasty…you may become the
very first person to completely comprehend the entirety of the Grand
Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt his
blood beginning to pump. Neither Immortal Northwalker nor the even
more powerful Immortal Juhua had been able to even come close to
mastering the complete Grand Dao of the Sword, despite the fact that
they had travelled quite far along that path. And yet, they had
already become incredibly powerful figures that had awed the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty, and were even comparable to Celestial Immortals,
despite only being Loose Immortals. If he were to truly master the
complete Dao-Path of the Sword, then he would become a truly
formidable figure in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My talent is greater
than Immortal Juhua, and I have the divine ability, Starseizing
Hand…my starting point is much higher than his as well.” Ning
mused to himself, “And with the underwater estate assisting
me…given all of my advantages, if I’m still unable to become a
Sword Immortal who has completely mastered the Grand Dao of the
Sword, I’ll have no one to blame but myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt an
incomparably heroic aura surge within his breast. Senior Northwalker?
Immortal Juhua? He was going to become an even more powerful Sword
Immortal, the most powerful Sword Immortal of the entire Grand Xia
Dynasty! A Sword Immortal whose name would be known throughout the
Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A nine-story tower
is built on a foundation of earth. A journey of a thousand kilometers
starts with the first step. I must move forward on my path, one step
at a time.” Ning immediately moved towards the thatched hut, then
pulled open a book. It was the [Stellar Scroll One], [Stellar Scroll
Two], and so on…after placing these books on the stone table within
the thatched cottage, Ning sat down on a stone bench. Opening the
first scroll, Ning began to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, Chang Laijian
came to me, asking me for help…” Ning read on, his enunciation of
each character seemingly quite simple, but when spoken together, they
linked in a way which was filled with the exquisite music of the
great Dao. Naturally, this guided Ning’s heart to begin to enter a
state where his subconscious beagn to focus even more on
comprehending the Dao…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes grew
hooded as he stared towards the stars in the sky. Whoosh. A wind
arose. Small winds began to stir in the nearby region. Ning stood up,
then took a single step, and as he did, he seemed to become part of
the wind, merging into it. He was like the flapping wings of a giant
Roc, soaring about through the wind. With each movement, it was as
though he was using an evasive, agility technique; he’d disappear
in one place, then reappear somewhere else, where the wind had
arisen. This…this was the true [Windwing Evasion].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Gale.” The giant yellow bear nodded slightly. “He has reached the
Dao Domain level in yet another Dao. It seems as though in the past
four years, Ji Ning has improved considerably.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During these past few
years, Ning had accumulated many experiences and insights. All of
them were now being drawn out by the Stellar Hall, and they began to
burst forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Black-White
College in the distant Stillwater City, as Ning was reading the
[Stellar Scrolls] and meditating on the Dao in the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning and I have both completed our Raindragon
Guard missions. Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning returned to his
homeland, the Swallow Mountain region. For me to go there wouldn’t
help me much in gaining insights into the Dao of Constructs, so I
came back,” Northson said with a laugh. In front of him was senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, dressed in a sky-blue robe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus laughed, then
nodded. “You two junior apprentice-brothers truly are formidable.
Both of you became Raindragon Guards in such a short period of time.
To this very day, I have not yet joined the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, you have also reached the Wanxiang
level. I imagine that you will soon become a Raindragon Guard,”
Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. When I grow
a bit more powerful, I’ll join the Raindragon Guard.” Ninelotus
paused for a moment, then asked, “Right…when junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning returned to Swallow Mountain, did he tell
you where he was going?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said,
“Serpentwing Lake! Senior apprentice-brother said that in the
future, he would be living there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Serpentwing
Lake!” Ninelotus nodded gently, silently memorizing this name, then
laughed and rose to her feet. “I won’t bother you any further,
junior apprentice-brother. I’ll go back now.” Ninelotus stepped
onto a snowy white lotus-shaped magic treasure, then soared into the
skies, flying far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While soaring through
the skies, she had a hint of a smile in her eyes. “Serpentwing Lake
of Swallow Mountain? Master also said that I’ve spent too much time
in the College, and should go out and do some adventuring and broaden
my horizons. Mmm. I’ll first go visit Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and her
junior apprentice-sister departed from the Black-White College,
heading out on an adventure. The first destination for the two of
them was Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain.

Chapter 17 - The Third Stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
The Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wild gale howled
within the skies of the Stellar Hall. Occasionally, flames would fill
the skies, and occasionally, sheets of rain would fall. And Ning…he
was the master of the wind and the storm, as though everything was
under his command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A true genius.”
The giant yellow bear stood within the thatched cottage, staring off
into the distance. He couldn’t help but sigh, “In four short
years, he’s managed to improve this much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is formidable.”
The old black bull’s pair of ox-eyes were completely round as he
stared. “As long as this kid doesn’t screw up on his path and die
somewhere, he will definitely be able to reach Immortal Juhua’s
level with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
gave a sidelong glance to the old black bull. “Stop praising your
master. Your master, as an Earth Immortal, wasn’t able to overcome
the seventh level of the Wargod Hall…despite the assistance of the
underwater estate, in the end, he still became a Loose Immortal. How
can his talent be compared to Ji Ning’s? Ji Ning, in terms of
comprehension or temperament, is significantly superior to your
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull let
out an awkward laugh. “Look,” he said hurriedly, “Ji Ning is
now beginning to gain insights into the Dao of the Sword.” The
giant yellow bear turned to look over…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there,
amidst the strewn rocks. The wild gale, the torrential rain, the
blazing inferno…it had all vanished. In the area around him, one
surge of sword-ki after another began to emerge, visible to the naked
eye. They began to wantonly swing through the area near Ning, and
each stroke of sword-ki contained the profoundities of the Dao of the
Sword, as they continuously put on display the insights Ning was
gaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning himself, he
remained staring at the star-studded skies, focusing on one star in
particular. This was the star that contained the complete Grand Dao
of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when Ning
was comprehending the Dao, he had been like a blind man trying to
build a mental image of an elephant by using his hands to feel it. He
had advanced at a very slow pace, one step at a time…but now,
within the Stellar Hall, which contained an entire, complete
Dao-Path, it was as though a lamp had been lit within the darkness,
allowing Ning to see where he was going. The accumulated experiences
Ning had gained into the Dao of the Sword were beginning to burst
forth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His ability to
comprehend the Dao of the Sword is quite high,” the old black bull
breathed in surprise. “Ji Ning’s ability to comprehend the Dao of
the Sword has long surpassed the level of ‘comprehending one’s
sword-heart’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. A bit a
higher than I predicted.” The giant yellow bear laughed, then said
in praise, “It seems as though Master will finally have a true
successor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one minute
at a time. The sword-ki around Ning became increasingly intricate and
profound, and increasingly pure as well. The old black bull and the
giant yellow bear, these two magic treasure spirits who had lived for
unfathomably many years, watched leisurely as Ning continued to gain
insights into the Dao. They watched for more than half a month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It truly is
unfathomably profound.” Ning suddenly let out a surprised sigh, and
the sword-ki around him instantly, completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finished?” The old
black bull called to him. Ning turned to look, only to see the old
black bull and the giant yellow bear within the thatched hut. He
immediately nodded and sighed in amazement, “To be able to easily
view and analyze the complete Dao of the Sword is the dream of any
Sword Immortal. This time, when I viewed the entirety of the Grand
Dao of the Sword, I finally understood…that even our Black-White
College’s Immortal Northwalker’s [Three-Foot Sword] only
contained a small portion of the complete Grand Dao of the Sword. The
path of Immortal cultivators truly is a long, winding one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
giant yellow bear had a hint of a smile on his face. “What level
has your swordplay reached? Show it to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please provide me
with some guidance.” Ning manifested a longsword of elemental ki in
his hands. Calmly, he struck out with the sword, almost as though he
were painting something. The sword danced in his hands, just like the
brush of a master painter on a canvas; it was a very natural, relaxed
movement of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” The sword
of elemental ki flashed outwards, and a faint sword tip suddenly
appeared, leaving behind a sword-scar in the skies that could be seen
with the visible eye, as though a painter’s brush had left behind
visible markings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] - Sudden Sword Light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a reserved
sword. What a shocking sword.” The giant yellow bear’s eyes lit
up, and he couldn’t help but saying in praise, “The person who
was able to develop this sword technique was truly a genius, most
likely superior to even Juhua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
instantly said, angry, “Big Brother, how can you say that he’s
superior to Juhua? My master was an extremely powerful Loose Immortal
whose fame was well known throughout the lands under the control of
the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning explained, “This
sword technique is known as the [Three-Foot Sword], and it has a
total of nine stances. Just now, I displayed the third stance,
‘Sudden Sword Light’, the most powerful sword technique I am
currently capable of using. This sword technique was developed by the
most powerful Sword Immortal in the history of the Black-White
College, ‘Immortal Northwalker’. He was a Loose Immortal who
lived for more than a million years…but of course, in terms of
longevity, he couldn’t compare to senior Juhua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than a million
years?” The giant yellow bear stared at the old black bull. “Black
bull, this Immortal Northwalker was merely an Immortal of Stillwater
Commandery, but he still became so accomplished. I wasn’t wrong in
saying that he was more talented than Juhua, was I?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Maybe he had
even more monstrous luck than Juhua did,” the old black bull
snorted. The giant yellow bear stared at him. “You black bull…you
are going to be pig-headed with me? So I have to lock you up for a
few thousand years before you shape up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, we’re
just debating with words, not violence!” The old black bull
hurriedly took two steps back. Ning, seeing this, couldn’t help but
secretly laugh. These two…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was the spirit of
Immortal Juhua’s Immortal-ranked magic treasure, while the other
was the spirit of the estate which Daoist Threelives had forged. The
two were both magic treasure spirits, and yet they could actually end
up bickering like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother, let’s
not make a fool out of ourselves in front of Ji Ning. Am I right?”
The old black bull hung its head. The giant yellow bear couldn’t
even be bothered to look at the old black bull. He said directly to
Ning, “Ji Ning, you have finished comprehending the Dao in the
Stellar Hall…even if you spend more time here, it will be useless.
You will need more normal, everyday experiences in the real world
before you can gain more insights here! What do you plan to do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
said. “If I were to go challenge the third level of the Stellar
Hall, how are my chances now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now?” The giant
yellow bear hesitated. “Your insights into the Dao of the Sword
truly are at a higher level than I had anticipated. That that sword
technique of yours, that…what was it…the ‘[Three-Foot Sword]’?
It is quite formidable! Mm, and given that you have my master’s
most powerful divine ability…you should have a 30% chance of
overcoming the third level of the Wargod Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty percent?”
Ning was secretly startled. The Dao of Rainwater, the Dao of the
Inferno, the Dao of the Gale…he had improved significantly in all
three Daos. He had also made significant gains in the Dao of the
Sword, and had comprehended the third stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword]! Ning could sense that his power had increased dramatically!
But he still only had a thirty percent chance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you going to
challenge it?” The giant yellow bear asked. “Yes!” Ning nodded,
not hesitating at all. “Eh?” The giant yellow bear was puzzled.
“Why’ve you decided to challenge it? Aren’t you going to wait
until you are a bit stronger and have a better shot?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
can sense that I will soon break through to the tenth stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Once I make the
breakthrough, I will be at the Wanxiang level as a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. By then, I’ll have two new chances to challenge the Wargod
Hall, and the previous chance will have been wasted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Xiantian-level
Fiendgod Body Refiner, Ning had two chances. He used the first to
pass the first level of the Wargod Hall, and the second in a failed
attempt at the second level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Zifu-level
Fiendgod Body Refiner, Ning had gained two additional options. He had
only used one, to pass the second level of the Wargod Hall. If he
didn’t use this second option…he would soon break through to the
Wanxiang level, at which point it would be wasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” the
giant yellow bear said. “Follow me to the Wargod Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they exited the
Stellar Hall, they moved through the winding corridor, soon arriving
in front of the Wargod Hall. Ning pressed hand directly against the
giant bronze door that was covered with a layer of bloody light .
With a whoosh, that layer of bloody light devoured Ning, teleporting
him away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in a vast,
endless world. The ground here seemed to be stained red with blood,
and in the distance, a massive, towering edifice could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning saw
that the giant yellow bear had appeared out of nowhere, next to him.
“The third level?” The giant yellow bear looked towards Ning.
“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then!” The
giant yellow bear pointed towards the distant tower. “Go in through
the gates to that tower. You’ll be transported directly to the
third level. Remember; if you realize that you have no hopes of
winning, immediately use the talisman to teleport out. Your opponent
won’t show any mercy; if you aren’t careful, you might die. That
really wouldn’t be worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Swoosh!
Moving like a flash, he crossed the three hundred meters and arrived
at the gates to the tower, glowing with a hazy white light. He took a
step inside…and space twisted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level?”
Ning stared at his surroundings. This was a blurry white room that
was three thousand meters high and many thousands of meters in
circumference. “What’s the trial here on the third floor?” The
Darknorth swords materialized into Ning’s hands as he carefully
stared around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ray of golden light
shot out. It began to coalesce, quickly shaping into a golden-armored
general. This golden-armored general had a cold, cruel look on his
face, but his armor was incomparably beautiful. He had a pair of
warhammers in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
golden-armored general looked around, then a hint of delight appeared
on his face. Soon, his gaze fell upon Ning. Ning…felt his heart
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His subconscious was
frantically warning him that the golden-armored warrior in front of
him was extremely terrifying. His soul had never been wrong before,
and Ning instantly grew extremely cautious. “Didn’t the spirit of
the estate say that I have a 30% chance of winning? 30% isn’t that
bad…why is it that this golden-armored warrior gives me such a
terrifying sense of danger? Even ordinary Primal Daoists don’t have
such a terrifying presence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little kid, you seem
quite weak. The aura of your Fiendgod body isn’t that strong.”
The golden-armored warrior looked weighingly at Ning. “Although I’m
nothing more than an avatar created by a strand of divine
power…beating you will be far too easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Avatar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning new that Fiendgod
Body Refiners had special powers at special levels. At the Zifu
level, one would be capable of the Blood-Drop Rebirth ability. At the
Wanxiang level, one would be able to change one’s appearances and
features. At the Primal level, one could separate part of their flesh
and blood and form it into a clone, but the so-called ‘clones’ a
Primal could create were not capable of independent movement; they
had to move alongside the main body, and weren’t independent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to create an
avatar through a strand of divine power, and one that was able to
move about at that…this was definitely something only an extremely
powerful Fiendgod was capable of!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod?” Ning
held his breath. “It must be a Fiendgod who is at least at the Void
level. How could the avatar of a Fiendgod have been teleported here
by the Wargod Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What other secrets
does this underwater estate hold? In the past, Immortal Juhua was
capable of binding the estate and carrying it with him, but the old
black bull said…that Immortal Juhua always had the feeling that
there were other secrets hidden within it.” Ning cursed inwardly,
“Given that the avatar of a Fiendgod has appeared in the Wargod
Hall, even an idiot would be able to guess that there are other
secrets within the underwater estate.”
</P>

Chapter 18 - The Avatar of a Fiendgod
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I
have yet to truly be acknowledged by the spirit of the estate.”
Ning understood this point. There were many secrets which the giant
yellow bear refused to tell him. Instead, he had Ning go risk his
life time and time again. If Ning truly were to die…then, it would
be just like it had been for Immortal Juhua and Rampart. If he died,
he died. The spirit of the estate would wait the next master. Even
Daoist Threelives had stated that Ning would only be considered his
disciple upon reaching the ‘Empyrean God’ level; clearly, Ning’s
current level of power was far from being sufficient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense. The
more powerful a person is, the more attention will be paid to him.
Compared to the first time he met me, the spirit of the estate is
being much nicer nowadays.” Ning remembered quite well that the
first time he had met the giant yellow bear, the bear had paid him
almost no attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These thoughts flashed
through Ning’s mind, but he then immediately crushed them. This
wasn’t the time to over-analyze them! What truly mattered right now
was to defeat this Fiendgod avatar in front of him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard that
some powerful Fiendgods can create clones just by plucking hairs from
their bodies.” Ning stared at the distant, golden-armored warrior,
then said in a high voice, “However, in those legends, the power of
those transformed hairs are extremely weak…I imagine that this
avatar of yours is quite weak as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
warrior’s face changed slightly. Ning had cut straight to the heart
of the matter; indeed, this avatar was simply formed from a strand of
divine power, and even his ‘weapons’ were just formed from divine
power. In terms of just comparing bodies, this avatar’s body was
even weaker than Ning’s! However…his comprehension of the Dao was
far too high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my true body was
here, a single breath from me would disintegrate you!” An arrogant
look flashed through the golden-armored warrior’s eyes. “Even
though this is merely an extremely weak avatar, formed from a strand
of divine power…against you…hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disintegrate me with
a breath? It seems as though his true body is indeed extremely
formidable. No wonder I had such a sense of danger earlier. That
sense of danger from my subconscious must have originated from his
true body,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spread out his
divine will with a thought. Bang! His divine will poured out through
the Soulshaker Seal, instantly surging forward in a tidal wave and
crashing towards the soul of that golden-armored warrior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. The tidal wave of
divine will seemed to have crashed against an extremely unyielding
rock; as it smashed against it, despite being powerful, it couldn’t
overcome the resilience of the rock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, divine will?”
The golden-armored warrior shook his head, saying with disdain,
“Although the hint of my soul contained within this wisp of divine
power is very weak, the quality of it is far greater than yours. Your
divine will could be ten times stronger than it is now, and you still
wouldn’t’ be able to move me. Kid, use everything you have;
later, don’t blame me for not having given you a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
golden-armored warrior appeared quite brash, in truth, he was
pondering meticulously. This was because he, too, was both curious
and cautious about this legendary place. “The legendary abode of
the God-King…why have I been summoned to deal with a little child?
He’s so weak…where did this child come from, and what is his
relationship with the God-King? His soul is fairly strong, though;
he’s not yet at the Primal level, but his soul is already this
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
powerful, compared to the legendary God-King, he was filled with
dread and veneration. That one-armed God-King would most likely be
able to annihilate him with a single glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt that the
golden-armored warrior was mysterious. But the golden-armored warrior
also felt that Ning was similarly mysterious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, it
would’ve been enough to have a golem fight against you.” The
giant yellow bear said to itself, amused, “But you are indeed
someone with the potential to be the successor to Master, a person
who will roam the Three Realms…and so, I might as well let you find
a few things out in advance.” By letting Ning touch a few secrets,
it would actually help instigate Ning to work harder and desire to
learn more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite powerful, eh?
It’s been a long, long time since I’ve interacted with those
ancient, powerful presences as well.” The giant yellow bear was
also filled with desire. He had been alone for far, far too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third level of the
Wargod Hall. Ning was rapidly considering his options. “He’s a
weak avatar of an extremely powerful figure. His strength lies in the
fact that his insights into the Dao are very high, but his weakness
is that he is only formed from a strand of divine power. Because it
has been separated from his true body, it is like water that has been
separated from its source; after using up divine power, there’s no
way to replenish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of combat
required one to be able to use one’s strengths to attack others’
weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exhaust his divine
power!” Ning immediately began to move. Swoosh! He didn’t charge
directly forward. Instead, he rapidly retreated, while at the same
time generating more than seven hundred flying swords in front of
him. Late-stage Wanxiang elemental ki filled every single flying
sword, and instantly, the flying swords began to undulate slightly.
After having increased his comprehension of the Dao, it was now much
easier for Ning to utilize the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth level of
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].” Ning formed an flying
sword that seemed to be made of white jade in front of him. Swish!
Swish! Swish! One white jade sword after another formed, then flew at
high speed towards the golden-armored man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword formation
is quite profound, but unfortunately, the user is too weak.” The
golden-armored warrior raised his two massive warhammers in an
extremely leisurely manner, then strolled forward. With each step,
however, he traversed many hundreds of meters, even faster than Ning
using the Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus.”
Ning divided his mind, using half of it to control the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] and the other half to generate Waterflame
Lotuses. One enormous Waterflame Lotus after another began to bloom,
surrounding the golden-armored warrior and furiously seeking to
impede his movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is
troublesome.” The golden-armored warrior frowned. A warhammer in
his hand swung out, instantly creating rippling cracks in space. The
outer layer of the Waterflame Lotus it collided into immediately
began to crack, then finally shattered apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only destroyed a
single lotus?” The golden-armored warrior was secretly surprised.
But swish! Swish! Swish! The jade-white swords flew out, moving like
strokes of the brush on the canvas of the sky, all of them seeming
quite plain, simple, and reserved, but causing the golden-armored
warrior to feel exceptionally cautious. “The Dao of the Sword? And
what a fierce, terrifying sword technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank. The
golden-armored warrior swung out with his massive warhammer, blocking
one sword-flash after another. Each time he blocked one of Ning’s
sword-flashes, the warhammer would tremble. This was because the
warhammers were formed from divine power, and weren’t actual magic
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank. Clank. Clank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the
Waterflame Lotus that was infused with dire-ice and earthfire, and
the rays of sword-light from the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation],
the golden-armored warrior was temporarily befuddled…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When roaming the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains, the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
had been inferior to Ning’s close combat skills, but afterwards, at
the Black-White College, Ning had trained all the way from the early
Wanxiang stage to the late Wanxiang stage! The rise in power of his
elemental ki made it so that when Ning now used the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], the power was two levels higher than it had been
before. It was extremely close to Ning’s close combat power by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His avatar is
clearly very weak, but he’s still able to defend against all of my
techniques.” Ning’s face turned cold, and the Darknorth swords in
his hands disappeared. Immediately afterwards, a black greatbow
appeared in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black greatbow was
an Earth-ranked magic treasure. It could only be considered an
ordinary item, and it didn’t have any special, additional powers.
It was quite hard for Ning to locate a legendary divine bow, but…this
Earth-ranked greatbow was enough for Ning to display all of his
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand]!”
Ning instantly executed the [Starseizing Hand], holding the grip of
the bow with one hand and nocking the arrow and pulling the bowstring
with the other…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaak. He pulled the
bowstring to its maximum length. Ning’s eyes seemed to spit
lightning towards the distant figure. Pulling a bow didn’t require
much mental effort; it only used his divine power! This, Ning could
pull the bow, control the Waterflame Lotuses, and the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The arrow
flashed out, instantly passing through the distance between them and
arriving before the golden-armored warrior. “Not good.” The
golden-armored warrior was shocked ; this arrow was even faster than
the sword-flashes sent out be that [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. He hurriedly moved to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The giant
warhammer in his hands trembled so hard, it began to crack. It then
quickly healed, but the golden-armored warrior had to take a few
hurried steps back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of an
arrow…it came from accumulating strength, then letting it all
explode forth from the arrow. The explosive power of an arrow was
naturally even more powerful than Ning’s close combat power.
However, the weakness of an arrow was its lack of agility; so long as
enemies could dodge, the arrow would have been shot out for nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But, Ning and the
golden-armored warrior were only hundreds of meters away from each
other! Given the speed of the arrows which Ning shot out while using
the [Starseizing Hand], that distance would be passed in an instant.
It was simply too fast! And the Waterflame Lotuses and the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] were also restricting and impeding the
warrior’s movements! Due to these reasons, the golden-armored
warrior wasn’t able to dodge at all, and had to rely on his own
strength to block the arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Each
arrow carried a mountain-shattering force which burst forth with each
collision. The nearby Waterflame Lotuses of dire-ice and earthfire,
along with the late-stage Wanxiang-level [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] sword-flashes were hard to deal with as well. For a time,
the golden-armored warrior found it incredibly hard to cope, and his
divine power was rapidly depleting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
my divine power is going to be used up. After this avatar of mine
uses up its divine power, it’s going to dissipate.” The
golden-armored warrior couldn’t hesitate any longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“RAAAARGH!” The
golden-armored warriors suddenly let out an explosive shout. His
entire body suddenly radiated a powerful golden light, and the
warhammers in his hands transformed into streaks of light, shattering
the nearby sword-flashes of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] as
well as the Waterflame Lotuses as he charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shot out four
arrows in a row! These arrows were all under the control of Ning’s
divine will, and they were even able to slightly curve in midair,
attacking the golden-armored warrior in unison. There was no way the
golden-armored warrior could avoid the joint attack of these four
arrows; all he could do was hurriedly block, and in doing so, he was
immediately knocked backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotuses
and the sword-flashes of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] once
more formed and moved to entangle him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One arrow after
another, each containing astonishing, savage power. They all swept
towards him! These arrows guided by divine will moved in eerie,
unfathomably strange ways. Now only were the arrows too powerful…the
divine will caused them to adjust in minute ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little rascal,
do you dare fight me in close combat?” The golden-armored warrior
bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lose.” Ning
just replied in a soft voice as he shot out four more arrows
simultaneously. The golden-armored warrior was barely able to block
them, but then his entire body began to tremble, then collapsed and
vanished into the void. As his body vanished, he growled in anger,
clearly quite dissatisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a sigh. “This was a mere avatar of the Fiendgod, but he was
already quite difficult to deal with. I had to use the [Starseizing
Hand] eighteen times in a row, and 39 attacks with my [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation].” Ning could sense that his divine power
had been enormously depleted, as well as much of his elemental ki,
and he couldn’t help but feel secretly amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning
disappeareed into thin air. By the time the world grew clear, Ning
found himself within the main hall of the underwater estate again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…you actually used
the bow to win?” The giant yellow bear stared at Ning, disbelief in
his eyes. He had expected that this would be an extremely difficult
battle; the two would’ve fought savagely in close combat, and in
the end, Ning stood a high chance of losing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the end…Ning
had annihilated his foe by using the [Starseizing Hand] to shoot
arrows at him from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine ability
which Master transmitted to me, aside from being used in close
combat, can also be used to attack others with the bow,” Ning said
meekly. “I was lucky enough to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lucky?” The giant
yellow bear saw through Ning’s meekness and saw the smugness
underneath. “Fine, fine. You defeated the third level, and you can
go choose an Earth-ranked magic treasure or item of equivalent value.
Go!”
</P>

Chapter 19 - Nethercold
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasures Hall was
the same as it had always been. Hanging in the air at the top of the
hall were many powerful magic treasures and curious artifacts, all
emanating powerful ripples…if it weren’t for the fact that they
were separated from the bottom by restrictive spells, those powerful
ripples would easily annihilate Ji Ning if he were to interact with
them! Ning felt no doubt about this whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
and Ning were within the Treasures Hall. “Ji Ning, you may now
begin to select Earth-ranked magic treasures from the Treasures
Hall,” the giant yellow bear said, looking at Ning. “You must be
even more careful than in the past, when you chose a Mortal-ranked
magic treasure. This is because although you moved quite quickly from
the Zifu level to the Wanxiang level, you will most likely take far
more time to move to the Primal level. As for going from the Primal
level to the Void level, the amount of time that will consume is even
greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
farther along the path one went, the longer it would take to reach
the next stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The same is true as
well in selecting magic treasures.” The giant yellow bear said, “It
is guaranteed that you will only be using Mortal-ranked magic
treasures for a short period of time; the three that you chose
previously, for example, are most likely already of limited use to
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Of the
three he had chosen, he had sold off the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation at Stillwater City’s Carefree Caverns long ago! As for
the Nine Yang Swords Formation, he had replaced them with the
superior Northriver Sword Formation which he had acquired at the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword, which he could use for sneak attacks, was still
being regularly used. However…this sword had its flaws as well. It
was most suited for underground sneak attacks; in other situations,
such as when battling in midair in the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains, as soon as it moved close to the enemy, it would be easily
discovered, at which point in time it could no longer used for a
sneak attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve passed
through the third level of the Wargod Hall, and soon, you’ll be
able to overcome the fourth level. Once your Fiendgod body reaches
the Wanxiang level…you’ll have had a total of three chances to
obtain Earth-ranked magic treasures, or artifacts of an equivalent
value.” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “Choose carefully.
Some of the top-grade magic artifacts present are most likely only
owned by the most powerful of organizations in this major world of
the Grand Xia Dynasty’s. It will be incredibly difficult to
purchase or trade for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. There were
very few top-grade Mortal-ranked magic treasures, and top-grade
Earth-ranked treasures were even more incomparably rare. They were
almost never seen, and to find one suitable for one’s self was even
less likely. He, however, now had a chance to choose amongst the
top-grade Earth-ranked magic treasures of the underwater estate for
one he liked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose.” The giant
yellow bear produced a golden book out of nowhere, and the book was
covered with two Fiendgod characters for ‘Precious Treasures’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that this
book looks identical to the Mortal-ranked magic treasures book?”
Ning couldn’t help but ask this question. The giant yellow bear
looked at Ning. “Not just Earth-ranked; the Heaven-ranked,
Immortal-ranked, and Pure Yang-ranked magic treasures book are the
same as well, because I personally compile these books. This is your
first time choosing an Earth-ranked magic treasure, and so I will
only show you a portion of the items available. The second time,
you’ll have more options, and the third time, you’ll be able to
go through any of the items in the book.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked hurriedly,
“Senior, which is the most suited to me?” The treasures to be
chosen from were simply too dazzling. Only the giant yellow bear
would know which were the best. Last time, for example, the giant
yellow bear had advised him to choose the Nine Yang Sword Formation,
and the third time, he had indeed chosen it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are plenty of
precious artifacts, quite a few of which are suited to you,” the
giant yellow bear said. “I think you should read through it
slowly.” Resigned, Ning began to flip through the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, this really
is…!” Ning’s gaze instantly grew heated. He had gone to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain before, and had seen the Earth-ranked
magic treasures there, and had also seen some Earth-ranked treasures
that were only for display and not for sale; these were some of the
most precious, top-quality magic treasures of that local branch of
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Without having a few treasures like
this to display, how could the Heavenly Treasures Mountain awe the
masses? But Ning couldn’t help but think to himself, “All of
these treasures are comparable to those items at the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain.” His heartrate sped up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xuanwu’s Goldscale
Ship; a top-grade Earth-ranked flying treasure. While flying, it
could transform into a goldscale fish that could soar into the
heavens or burrow into the ground. It was incomparably quick when
flying, and was as incomparably nimble in the skies as a fish was in
the water. Upon entering the ground, it would become even more agile,
comparable to many Heaven-ranked flying treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, given that
it was named after Xuanwu, the Black Tortoise, it was also
incomparably sturdy. When hiding within the Xuanwu Goldscale Ship,
even a Primal Daoist’s attacks would find it difficult to do
anything to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an item,”
Ning murmured to himself. “In the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, I
saw an item on display, the ‘Ruyi Godspeed Boat’, which was
comparable to this item in speed but far weaker in defense. And yet,
that was enough for it to be considered one of their not-for-sale
items.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was indeed an
excellent item. However, since it was guaranteed that Ning would at
most have three chances to choose Earth-ranked magic treasures, he
wasn’t willing to waste one of the three chances on a flying magic
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthfire Heartlamp, a
strange artifact. The Earthfire Heartlamp was a unique sort of rock
that was formed from the natural world. It was naturally formed into
the shape of the lamp, and within it there was something akin to the
extracted essence of fire…this extract was incomparably, shockingly
effective in nurturing earthfire, and if Ning were to often place his
earthfire within it and absorb from that essence, in ten short years,
his earthfire would rise to be of the first grade! If other types of
supportive treasures were used, the amount of time it would take for
earthfire to be nourished to the first rank would be even less.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthfire
Heartlamp!” Ning was truly intrigued. Although many of the previous
items had caused his heartrate to speed up, this was the first time
he was truly filled with a powerful urge. “This is what I’ll
choose, I imagine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I choose it?”
Ning began to ponder. “Earthfire, at the first grade, is capable of
threatening even Primal Daoists. But this will take roughly ten
years.” Ning thought about it, shaking his head in the end. “In
ten years, my [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] will
probably have increased dramatically in power, and my swordplay as
well; earthfire of the first grade won’t be as helpful then as it
would be now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had only been four
years since he had joined the Black-White College! And yet, he had
already developed the third stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]! He had
truly improved tremendously during the past four years. Ten years
ago, he had been fighting with the Azure Skysnake, and had just
arrived at the Eastmount Marshes after having left West Prefecture
City. Now, ten years later, he was capable of effortlessly killing
Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was true
that the further along one went, the slower one improved, ten
years…Ning felt confident that he would improve dramatically in
this period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s very good
item.” Ning pondered a bit more. “However, it’s guaranteed that
the goldflame earthfire will never be my most powerful attack; in
addition, my body has both earthfire and dire-ice. When using the
Waterflame Lotus, ideally, the dire-ice and earthfire should be
balanced. If the earthfire is too powerful or the dire-ice too weak,
that will not be good for my Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even without this
Earthfire Heartlamp, I’ll still have the ancient glacial ice, the
firelotus pith, and other treasures. Although they are a bit slower,
and will only be able to improve my earthfire and dire-ice to the
fourth or fifth grade, at least the power will be matched.” Ning
persuaded himself to forget it, then began to continue reading.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One magic treasure
after another. In the past, any Earth-ranked magic treasures were
very alluring, but that was before Ning had truly gone out
adventuring. Now that he was a disciple of the Black-White College, a
Raindragon Guard, and had visited the Heavenly Treasures Mountain…his
horizons had been broaded, and only now did he understand how
precious and rare the priceless items which Daoist Threelives had
left behind were. Most likely, not even the treasures of the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty were comparable to the items here. Unfortunately,
he was only allowed to choose three items from each level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brocade-Cloud
Miasma, a top-grade Earth-ranked protective item…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Hundred Venoms
Immortal-Lock Formation…an Earth-ranked formation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dire-Ice Mirror…a
precious item capable of improving dire-ice to the first grade in ten
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One precious item after
another. Ning’s eyes were turning red from desire. “Senior, you
should treat the Dire-Ice Mirror and the Earthfire Heartlamp as one
treasure,” Ning said, raising his head to look at the giant yellow
bear. “If you did, I’d pick it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As one treasure?”
The giant yellow bear stared at him. “Are you not aware that many
different types of earthfire and dire-ice are only capable of being
improved to the third or second grades? Although some have the
potential to be improved to the first grade, that’s just potential!
How hard would it be for one to truly improve it to the first grade?
Upon doing so, once it is further upgraded to skyfire, its potential
and its power will become even greater. Are you aware of all this? I
refuse to believe that in the entirety of the Grand Xia Dynasty,
you’ll be able to find a single place which is willing to sell
Earthfire Heartlamps or Dire-Ice Mirrors to outsiders!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
Sell it to outsiders? In the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and the
Carefree Caverns, he truly had never seen these items for sale
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These rare artifacts
were all formed naturally by the natural world, and were not magic
treasures which would be created or forged. Thus, there was a very
limited number of them in the world. Given that there were thousands
of Heavenly Treasures Mountains, one in each commandery, how could
they possibly sell Earthfire Heartlamps to outsiders?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only reason I
brought out the Earthfire Heartlamp and Dire-Ice Mirror out for your
first selection is because I saw that you, kid, have dire-ice and
earthfire in your body.” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “I’m
taking special care of you, which is why I expanded the range of
choices a bit. To tell you the truth, there are three items that are
the most suited for you in this selection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Earthfire
Heartlamp and the Dire-Ice Mirror are two of them. There is a third,
however, on the third to last page.” As soon as the giant yellow
bear’s words came out, Ning immediately flipped to the third to the
last page, looking at it carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nethercold Sword
Formation. The Nethercold Sword Formation was made up of nine
top-grade Earth-ranked flying swords, each of which was made from an
extremely precious material known as the nethercold lunar metal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All nine are
top-grade Earth-ranked flying swords?” Ning was so shocked, his
eyes bulged out. These so-called ‘top-grade’ items were not
graded by the Heavenly Treasures Mountain; they were graded by Daoist
Threelives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were on
completely different levels; Daoist Threelieves was far more strict
in grading these magic treasures. There were some items he had left
behind, such as the Nine Yang Swords Formation which Ning had chosen
previously, which he had ranked as nine high-grade items, but which
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain would rank as nine top-grade items!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can all nine be
top-grade Earth-ranked swords?” Ning stared in shock at the giant
yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Originally, I
planned on separating the nine of them and just putting in a record
for a ‘Nethercold Sword, a top-grade Earth-ranked flying sword’.”
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “But afterwards, I
reconsidered; if I were to split them apart, I would probably go
through dozens or even hundreds of masters without any of them
choosing a Nethercold Sword. So, I decided I might as well list them
here together, as a sword formation. Because these nine swords form a
complete sword formation…logically speaking, I shouldn’t have
shown it to you until your third selection. However, I don’t want
for you to die early on in the outside world, kid. So, I decided to
just forget it, and let you see it in advance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthfire Heartlamp,
Dire-Ice Mirror, Nethercold Sword Formation. These are the most
suited for you.” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “Choose.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_20___Senior_Apprentice_S"></A>
Chapter 20 - Senior Apprentice-Sister Ninelotus
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning hesitated.
Which to choose?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
hurriedly, deferentially asked, “Given that when my Fiendgod body
reaches the Wanxiang level, I’ll have another chance to acquire an
Earth-ranked magic treasure after overcoming the fourth level of the
Wargod Hall…will I have the chance to acquire even better magic
treasures at that time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course!” The
giant yellow bear said confidently, “Items better than the
Earthfire Heartlamp, the Dire-Ice Mirror, and the Nethercold Sword
Formation…there will be more than one that is better than these
three! You’ve merely overcome the third level of the Wargod Hall;
how can I possibly bring out the very best Earth-ranked magic
treasures right away? When I bring those out, you won’t choose the
likes of the Earthfire Heartlamp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and choose.
In the end, there will be countless treasures, but unfortunately, I
can’t give them all to you.” The giant yellow bear looked at
Ning. “Master left behind many treasures, but not for just any
single successor. In the event of your death, I need to ensure that
the next successor has some treasures as well, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pursed his lips.
What a doleful thing to say! Die? Ning absolutely didn’t wish to
fail, after having embarked on the Immortal path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my choice.”
Ning flipped through the book to the third to last page, the one
mentioning the Nethercold Sword Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really do want the
Earthfire Heartlamp and the Dire-Ice Mirror,” Ning sighed to
himself. “However, they aren’t able to increase my power right
away, but the Nethercold Sword Formation can! These nine Nethercold
Swords in the formation are all top-grade, and it was Daoist
Threelives who was the appraiser; their power must be superior to
that of ordinary Heaven-ranked flying swords. They’ll be able to
increase the power of my [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to a
whole new level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher one’s
level of power became, the more difficult it was to further
strengthen one’s self. To rise by a full level was incomparably
difficult, but these Nethercold Swords were simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he were to go and
try to purchase them at the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, their price
would surpass that of an ordinary Heaven-ranked flying sword. And,
given their rarity, they would probably at least five thousand
kilograms per sword! With all nine top-grade flying swords having
come from the same source…the entire set would definitely go for at
least fifty thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Fifty
thousand kilograms? That was enough to make even a Primal Daoist turn
green in envy. Even when Ning had been lucky enough to loot the
corpse of the Dragonwhale King, he hadn’t reaped such a fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] depends entirely on the powerful
flying swords comprising it! This is completely indisputable!
Fortunately, I have the Treasures Hall,” Ning mused to himself. “In
turn, only in my hands can this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
unleash its true, terrifying power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful the
swords used, the more monstrous and heaven-defying these swords were.
In the past, the Thousand Swords Immortal had grown tremendously
famous with this technique, but in the end, he had still fallen to
Immortal Juhua. Given that Ning had the Treasure Hall behind him…the
power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would be even more
incomparably shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” The giant
yellow bear beckoned towards the distance. In the void above, a point
of light suddenly flashed and started to descend. It quickly passed
through the restrictive spells, arriving next to Ning. It was nine
completely black flying swords. Although they were completely black,
they had a very soft, luxuriant gleam to them; it was almost as
though a faint, extremely dark green luster covered these flying
swords. They were so beautiful that they could be considered a work
of art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are perfect.”
Ning couldn’t help but let out a sigh of praise. Reaching out with
this elemental ki, he sent one strand after another of watery-blue ki
forward, swirling around the nine Nethercold Swords and easily
binding them. With but a thought, Ning sent them swirling around him
like nine shining stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are comparable
to Heaven-ranked magic treasures in power,” Ning said in praise.
Heaven-ranked magic treasures were only usable by Primal Daoists, but
his magic treasures were also at this level of power…this was why
they were considered top-grade treasures. And he had nine of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely, they
would be enough to cause even Primal Daoists to grow envious and kill
me for them,” Ning said with a soft laugh. The giant yellow bear
replied, “If they don’t bind them personally, it’ll be hard for
them to tell just by looking at them that these are top-grade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What fine
treasures.” The more Ning thought about them, the happier he
became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go. If you
want more treasures, go back and train hard,” the giant yellow bear
urged. Ning nodded. Instantly, a phantom of a giant bear’s head
appeared, swallowing Ning with a single gulp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island. Soon, everyone on the island knew that after half
a month, Ji Ning had left from his secluded meditation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Ning, no one
else knew of the existence of the underwater estate. Given that
Ning’s training room was a place where others were strictly
forbidden from trespassing, everyone had assumed that he had been in
the room training this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master!”
An azure-robed maiden was the first to suddenly appear at the
entrance of the room. Ning walked out of it, raising his head to look
towards the outside. A cold wind pressed down upon him, and giant
plumes of snow were falling down from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, why is it
that after you went into training, I could no longer sense your
presence?” The azure-robed maiden stared at Ning, mentally sending
to him with franticness, “I felt as though you were very, very far
away. I’m your spirit-beast, and our spirit-bond was not dispersed,
so I knew that you weren’t dead, but…if you weren’t dead, why
couldn’t I sense you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Whitewater
Hound walked over, sending mentally, “Ning, son, when you went into
training, this Azure Skysnake wanted to go inside to search for you.
I had to stop her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning laughed.
The first time he had entered the underwater estate, he had caused
his father and mother to be concerned over him. They all knew that he
had entered a special, ancient relic site, and naturally, Uncle White
had learned this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had a stroke of
karmic luck,” Ning said. “Luck?” Qingqing was surprised. The
Grand Xia Dynasty’s territory was simply too vast and contained far
too many secrets; anything was possible within it. For example,
someone might be in the middle of a perfectly normal battle when an
ancient Fiendgod might suddenly wake up and intervene. If this could
happen, what couldn’t?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qingqing could tell
that Ning didn’t want to discuss this in detail, so she just
muttered to herself, “So stingy with your secrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. The
underwater estate involved Daoist Threelives, and it was so important
as to be able to shock the entire Three Realms! How could Ning
casually reveal its secrets to others? For example, although he was
now the master of the underwater estate, he was the only one who
could enter it; others could not. Thus, Ning hadn’t even told his
parents; after all, given that his parents couldn’t enter it,
letting them know of it would only prove problematic, not beneficial
in any way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf walked towards them from afar, face covered in smiles.
“You’ve left your secluded meditation. During this period of
time, young master Ji Mo came. He wished to ask for your
instructions, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Mo?” Ning
nodded. “During those first three days after my return, he hadn’t
come.” Ji Mo was, aside from Ning himself, the most talented member
of the younger generation of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji Mo
was adventuring and testing himself in the outside world as well,”
Autumn Leaf said. “Thus, when you returned, the Patriarch sent
people out to find young master Jji Mo. They spent quite a few days
before finding him, and afterwards, young master Ji Mo came by
himself, arriving on the ninth day of your secluded meditation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smiling, Ning nodded.
Suddenly, another figure appeared in the distance. In but two
flashes, the figure appeared close to them; it was a tall,
sturdy-looking handsome youth with a pair of sword-shaped eyebrows.
He stared towards Ning with a blazingly eager gaze, and he
immediately said with respect, “I pay my respects to you, young
master Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
you’ve improved quite a bit in recent years,” Ning said with a
praising laugh. With but a single glance, he could tell that Ji Mo’s
aura had changed significantly. In the past, Ji Mo had been quite
reserved, but now, Ji Mo seemed like a drawn warblade. He had a
powerful, sturdy willpower that was forged through battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to you,
young master, I’m still quite inferior,” Ji Mo said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are willing,”
Ning suddenly said, “You can come here and stay here whenever you
please.” Ji Mo was stunned. Instantly, he revealed a look of joy on
his face. In the past, he had knelt down to beg Ji Ning to accept him
as disciple, but at that time, Ning was focused on his own pursuit of
the Dao, and didn’t have any time to spare. Now that Ning had
chosen to permanently stay here at Serpentwing Lake…he was
naturally willing to occasionally make the time to provide some
guidance to the most talented younger members of the Ji clan. This
could be considered a way in which he would help the Ji clan train
future experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning present?” A very familiar voice rang
out, echoing throughout the entire Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone who
addresses our young master as ‘junior apprentice-brother’?”
Autumn Leaf revealed a look of amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone who is
addressing the island master as junior apprentice-brother?” The
many maids and servants who lived on Brightheart Island all revealed
looks of amazement. The ‘island master’ was, of course, the
master of Brightheart Island, Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone in
the Serpentwing Lake area was puzzled and curious. Only a very few of
them knew that Ning had joined the Black-White College, and they were
able to guess at the truth: “Most likely, a member of the
Black-White College has come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this
voice, Ning also lifted his head in surprise, staring towards the
source of the voice. A masted ship soared towards them from the
distance, with two beautiful, indistinct figures atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, it seems
to be two of your senior apprentice-sisters,” the Whitewater Hound
sent. “You really are formidable. As soon as you came back, you
managed to get two of your senior apprentice-sisters to chase after
you all the way here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at Uncle
White. “They are just passing through and paying their respects.”
Uncle White just snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lifted his head,
staring towards the distant ship. He said softly, “But it really is
a coincidence. As soon as I left my seclusion, they arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning
immediately flew into the skies to go greet them. “Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, senior apprentice-sister Qingqing.” In
the skies above Serpentwing Lake were the blue-robed Ninelotus and
the silver-robed Qingqing. They, too, flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We learned from
junior apprentice-brother Twinwood that you, junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, were living here,” Ninelotus laughed.
“We are out adventuring and just so happened to go past Swallow
Mountain, so we decided to come and pay a visit. Junior
apprentice-brother, you really have quite the eye; you actually chose
such a beautiful place! This vast Serpentwing Lake, and that island
in the center of the lake; they are all quite lovely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look.
Indeed; light rippled off the waves, which appeared as beautiful as
jade, and the countless flowers and grassy areas on the central
island, along with the various pavilions, made it look like a true
utopia, a peach garden beyond the mortal world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, you don’t know this, but this used to be the
territory of a monster,” Ning said with a laugh. “Afterwards, I
eradicated that monster, and our Ji clan arranged for quite a few
people to spend a long period of time renovating the place. Only then
was the previously monster-infested island changed to its current
appearance. My two senior apprentice-sisters, let’s not chat in the
air. Come, let me show you around my island and show you some
hospitality.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and Qingqing,
along with Ji Ning, immediately flew down. The mortal maids of
Brightheart Island all murmured to themselves, “Wow…as Immortal
fairies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are flying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are so
beautiful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goddesses!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the mortals were
extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of three
quickly descended. The Azure Skysnake and the Whitewater Hound came
over at this time as well. “These two Diremonsters are the ones
which junior apprentice-brother Twinwood spoke of, right? The Azure
Skysnake, ‘Qingqing’, and the Whitewater Hound, ‘Uncle White’?”
Ninelotus laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Qingqing!?”
The nearby, silver-robed maiden instantly stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Qingqing,
she’s also named Qingqing.” Ninelotus choked back a laugh. She
had been waiting, a long, long time to say these words; she had been
eagerly anticipating the meeting between these two Qingqings.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 21 - Life With Ninelotus
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Luo
Qing.” The silver-robed maiden stared at the Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
replied, “My name is Ji Qingqing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, they began to
laugh and chat amongst themselves. These two ‘Qingqings’ grew
quite close to each other. From this day forward, Ninelotus and Luo
Qing began to temporarily live at Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only at nightfall did
the snowfall come to a halt. In the sword-training terrace of
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” Ji
Mo was incomparably respectful, and his eyes were filled with
anticipation and eagerness. “Please provide me with some guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood with hands
clasped behind his back, not too far away. With but a thought, he
instantly created multiple waterflame swords out of nowhere through
his elemental ki. These waterflame swords were incomparably fierce,
and they began to swirl around Ji Mo. Ji Mo’s face changed…although
Ning had merely activated the power of the natural world, it was
still enough to cause a Xiantian lifeform to be in tremendous danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense.” Ning’s
eyes flashed as he looked at the manifestations of sword-ki. The many
waterflame swords in midair quickly condensed into a single, massive
lotus of sword-ki that was many tens of meters in diameter. The
sword-ki had formed into a blooming lotus which had completely
surrounded Ji Mo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Mo,” Ning said.
“This lotus of sword-ki contains some elementary tricks and knacks
of the sword. There are a total of ninety one lotus petals that are
revolving around you, each of which has a different type of
sword-ki…what you need to do is destroy all of the lotus petals.
Only after you destroy all of the lotus petals can you be said to
have truly gained a basic level of expertise in the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that I
can’t be said to have reached even a basic level of expertise? But
I reached the ‘one with the world’ level long ago,” Ji Mo
couldn’t refrain from saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t even
gained a hint of the True Meaning of the Dao; how can you be
considered to have reached a basic level of expertise?” Ning shook
his head, then sat down nearby, leisurely pouring himself a cup of
wine. While drinking some of this wine that Autumn Leaf had specially
prepared, he pondered on the fourth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” From afar, a woman walked over; it was
Ninelotus and Luo Qing. In terms of appearance, they were absolutely
the most beautiful women here at Brightheart Lake, and in terms of
aura? They were disciples of the Black-White College! Luo Qing’s
aura was quite unique, while Ninelotus was an incomparably dazzling
figure even within the Black-White College who had drawn quite a few
suitors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to glance
at them, then hurriedly rose to his feet. “Senior
apprentice-sisters Ninelotus and Luo Qing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are training
your clan members?” Ninelotus glanced with interest towards the
enormous lotus of sword-ki, as well as Ji Mo, who was striving to
attack the lotus petals from the center of the lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lotus?” The
nearby Luo Qing laughed in surprise. “You were actually able to
form a lotus of sword-ki by activating the energy of nature. It seems
as though you are quite formidable in the mysteries of the lotus,
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
just learned a few things and developed a protective technique, the
Waterflame Lotus…which is why I have a few simple insights into the
lotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lotus flower…its
very existence was filled with countless mysteries. In the Three
Realms, there were many major powers who would seat themselves on
thrones of lotus flowers, or have protective lotus-treasures, or use
lotus-related techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus has comprehended many things pertaining
to the lotus as well,” Luo Qing hurriedly said. Ninelotus shook her
head. “A bit less than junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” she
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Artificial modesty!”
Luo Qing frowned, then let out a smirk. “In terms of swordplay,
it’s true that you cannot compare to junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning, but in terms of the lotus…senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus,
you were born into the Dongyan clan, which is referred to as the
Freshlotus Tribe …and the secret manual which brought your tribe to
prominence is the ‘Fresh Lotus Manual’! In terms of the lotus, I
imagine that none of us third-generation disciples of the Black-White
College can compare to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Ninelotus in surprise. The Dongyan clan? He had read various
intelligence reports regarding the major powers of the Stillwater
Commandery region. The Dongyan clan was an extremely powerful clan.
Although it wasn’t ranked amongst the eight major powers of
Stillwater Commandery, the actual power of the Dongyan clan was
actually superior to the likes of the Black-White College, the
Skysplitter Sword Sect, the Eastriver clan, the Dragonhunter clan,
and the other four! This was because the Dongyan clan’s roots were
actually in another place, the Highwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dongyan clan’s
roots were from the Highwater Commandery, but they were located in
multiple other commandery cities. It could be said that the Dongyan
clan stretched across three entire commanderies! It was a truly
ancient and powerful clan. It was only because it was generally
considered a power of the Highwater Commandery that it was not ranked
amongst the eight great powers of Stillwater Commandery. But in terms
of total power, in Stillwater Commandery, most likely only the
Northmont clan or the local Raindragon Guards surpassed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus has such an extraordinary aura and
demeanor, and was so unique even in the Black-White College.” Ning
sighed in amazement to himself. “So she’s from such an ancient
clan, the Dongyan clan. The genius disciples of such an ancient,
deeply rooted clan…they truly are extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you come from the
Dongyan clan. The Dongyan clan’s ‘Fresh Lotus Manual’ has long
been famous throughout the world,” Ning said with a laugh. “I do
have a few questions; might you be willing to answer them, senior
apprentice-sister?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, please go ahead and ask them. If I can answer
them, of course I will; if I’m not able to, then please don’t
blame me,” Ninelotus replied. Ning was secretly elated; Ninelotus
was from the Dongyan clan, and she most likely had an extremely deep
level of understanding regarding the secrets of the lotus flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once self-created
a technique, the Waterflame Lotus…” Ning immediately began to ask
questions. Stretching his hand out, he immediately caused a small
Waterflame Lotus to bloom out of nowhere atop his palm and began to
discuss some questions he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, actually, you’ve gained a very deep level of
insight already. However, you’ve never truly realized the ways in
which the various elements of this technique interact with each
other.” A fresh, azure lotus appeared within Ninelotus’ palm as
well. She lightly tapped just one of the petals, and one petal after
another instantly began to open, like a real lotus flower beginning
to bloom. In fact, one could even see the dew atop the petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes began to
shine as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, junior
apprentice-brother, this Waterflame Lotus of yours…” Ninelotus
began to ask questions of her own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, the
secrets within are quite simple…” Ning began to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two both possessed
extraordinarily strong Dao-hearts, and were quite resolute in
pursuing their Immortal paths. Once they became absorbed in
discussing the Dao, they naturally began to ignore everything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them…one
was a truly monstrous genius of the Dao of the Sword, who had the
support of the underwater estate and who had gained quite a few
insights into the lotus. As for the other, she came from the massive,
mighty Dongyan clan, and had meditated on the Fresh Lotus Manual, and
was even more impressive with regards to the secrets of the lotus. As
the two of them discussed their insights into the Dao, they stirred
insights in each other, and both of them improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
Immortal cultivators delighted in discussing the Dao with others who
were on the same level. If they were to truly discuss the insights
they had gained without holding anything back, then as they discussed
the Dao together, both would gain tremendously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
was a supportive technique Ning had personally developed, and so
there was no need for him to withhold any of its secrets. As for
Ninelotus, she knew exactly what she could say, as the Dongyan clan
was an incredibly majestic clan which had strict rules on what its
disciples could and could not say when discussing the Dao. Ninelotus
only revealed a few of the profound mysteries that could not be
considered the true secrets of the clan, but this was already enough
to cause Ning to feel incomparably delighted and overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two are chatting
quite happily to each other.” The nearby Luo Qing felt helpless;
while absorbed into their discussions of the Dao, Ji Ning and
Ninelotus paid no attention to her whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” She sat
there next to them, picking up the vessel of wine that had previously
belonged to Ning and beginning to drink it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An entire night was
spent in a discussion on the Dao. Autumn Leaf and the others didn’t
dare disturb them. But by nightfall the second day, as the sun was
about to disappear…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! The two of
you are still here?!” A silver-robed Luo Qing walked past, staring
at them and shouting. As she did, Ning and Ninelotus instantly ‘woke
up’. They immediately realized that a night and a day had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning truly is brimming with talented. Although
this Waterflame Lotus technique of his isn’t that profound, he’s
gained so many insights from it.” Ninelotus began to feel even more
admiring of him now. She had joined the Black-White College a long
time ago, but as soon as Ning had joined, he had debated many senior
fellow disciples in the Dao Debates. If she had engaged in a Dao
Debate with Ning back then, she definitely would’ve been defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, Ninelotus
had begun to admire Ji Ning. Now that she saw that Ning had so many
insights into the lotus, which she herself specialized in, she grew
all the more admiring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus has truly treated me well. She’s told
me so many secrets.” Ning felt secretly grateful; after all, these
techniques were not to be casually taught to others. Although she
wasn’t explicit about them, the pointers that she gave caused Ning
to instantly comprehend. If it hadn’t been for her guidance, he
probably would’ve needed a much, much longer period of time to
understand some of the things he had learned today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, we’ve discussed the Dao for very long,
and I’ve benefited greatly from it. I’m going to go back and
meditate,” Ninelotus said, rising to her feet. As she did, she took
the nearby Luo Qing’s hand and walked together to their residences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as
Ninelotus left. Thinking back to the night and day they had spent
discussing the Dao, he couldn’t help but feel a strange feeling in
his heart. He felt as though…he and Ninelotus were quite suited for
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
his head. The lotus of sword-ki which he had generated previously was
still active. As for Ji Mo, who was within the lotus, his face was
pale, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. Clearly, he had been
striving an entire day and night to break the formation, and he was
utterly exhausted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…I ended up making
Ji Mo spend an entire day and night here.” Ning willed the lotus to
dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The lotus of
sword-ki instantly disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Petals? Petals?!”
Ji Mo hurriedly stared around him, his eyes terrifyingly bloodshot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Mo.” Ning felt
guilty, but he still called out in a high voice, “You’ve spent an
entire day and night on breaking through this formaton; it seems you
are rather tired. Go back and get some rest. Tomorrow, you may come
back again and once more attempt to break this lotus sword-ki
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Ning
turned and left. Ji Mo stared, stunned, for a moment, then began to
worry. “I spent an entire day and night here without being able to
break through the sword-ki lotus…did this cause young master Ji
Ning to feel angry with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and Ning both
gained significantly from their discussions on the Dao; naturally,
they were quite delighted to continue. Every three or five days, they
would engage in a discussion on the Dao. In the blink of an eye, more
than three months had passed in leisure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private,
secluded room within Brightheart Island. This was Luo Qing and
Ninelotus’ room. Luo Qing and Ninelotus were currently seated next
to a black stone table which was as smooth as jade. Atop the table
was fruit and wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister,” Luo Qing said, “We’ve spent three months
here. Isn’t it time to leave? We came out to go adventuring, but
the only place we’ve gone to is this place, Serpentwing Lake. We
haven’t gone anywhere else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush,”
Ninelotus said. “Let’s spend a few more days here. During the
past three months, my lotus techniques have improved considerably,
even more so than in the past three years. Junior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning truly is formidable; he always has so many new and original
insights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still aren’t
leaving?” Luo Qing stared, then gave Ninelotus a weighing glance.
She stared carefully at Ninelotus, as though trying to find any warts
or blemishes on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you looking
at? Why are you staring at me like that?” Ninelotus frowned
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, I wonder…have you taken a fancy to Ji Ning, and
wish for him to be your Dao-Companion?” Luo Qing asked the question
directly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was stunned.
Despite always being so composed, she suddenly felt rather
embarrassed.
</P>

Chapter 22 - The Tenth Stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing was truly
quite familiar with Ninelotus; the two had known each other for many
years, and she had never before seen this expression on Ninelotus’
face. Ninelotus had always been calm and composed, and she had a
breathtaking background; she had been selected long ago to be the
next leader of the Dongyan tribe. As such, Ninelotus had naturally
been given the best of training since youth. To force her to reveal
shyness and bashfulness…this was virtually impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…” Luo
Qing stared, her mouth falling open as she pointed to Ninelotus. “You
really are…” Ninelotus quickly recovered her calm. “Is there a
need for you to act so shocked?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shocked? Senior
apprentice-sister, when you were in the Dongyan clan, you had
countless admirers. Even in the Black-White College, where many of
our fellow disciples do not know of your history and background, you
still have many admirers and pursuers. You’ve never taken a fancy
to any of them!” Luo Qing said, shocked, “Why have you taken a
fancy to him? He’s a disciple of a small clan, and won’t be of
any help to you in administering the Dongyan clan’s affairs in the
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus frowned,
revealing a hint of displeasure. Luo Qing hurriedly shook her head
and said, “I’m not saying…I mean, you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the tribe
which Ji Ning is from is a weak and small one, his own potential is
quite astonishing,” Ninelotus said. “You must understand that for
some people, it doesn’t matter which tribe they come from, because
they, by themselves, are even mightier than entire tribes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus had a hint of
anticipation in her eyes. “And…in choosing a Dao-Companion, what
matters the most is the feeling one has in one’s heart. He…gives
me a very good feeling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing stared at
Ninelotus. “You really are choosing him for your Dao-Companion?”
Ninelotus shook her head. “Not just yet. Immortal cultivators have
extremely long lives, and the selection of a Dao-Companion is a
monumental, life-altering event. Naturally, I’ll have to spend more
time watching him and understanding him. We’ve only interacted for
three or so months; it’s still too early to discuss becoming
Dao-Companions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even mortals, when in a
relationship, would at least be together for a year or two before
getting married. Immortal practitioners…there were even those who
would be involved with each other for centuries before finally
becoming Dao-Companions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If news of this were
to spread, that the future Matriarch of the Dongyan clan has chosen a
Dao-Companion…oh, boy!” Luo Qing let out a sigh. “This would
definitely cause a storm of commentary!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My choice of a
Dao-Companion is mine alone. Who can intervene?” Ninelotus was very
calm. Luo Qing could sense how resolved Ninelotus was, and she
immediately said, “Senior apprentice-sister, I won’t try to
dissuade you from this decision. By staying here, you’ll be able to
improve your understanding of your lotus techniques, and also
continue to inspect a potential future Dao-Companion. For me,
however, staying here is pointless…I’m planning to leave
tomorrow. I’ll go around adventuring for half a year, then return
to the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of guilt
appeared on Ninelotus’ face, and she took Luo Qing by the hand.
“Qingqing, we said that we’d go out adventuring together…I’m
sorry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. Since
you are choosing a Dao-Companion, as your junior apprentice-sister,
of course I’ll be supportive,” Luo Qing said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day, Luo Qing
departed, having been sent off by Ji Ning and the others. As for Ning
and Ninelotus, they continued to live quite peacefully on Brightheart
Island, discussing the Dao every few days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Late one
night. Ning, who had been seated in the lotus position on his bed,
suddenly revealed a hint of excitement. “It seems that over the
course of the past five months, all these discussions on the Dao with
senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus has caused my understanding of the
ways in which fire and water support and neutralize each other to
rise significantly. I’ve finally understood the final principles
that were necessary for a breakthrough to the tenth stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In I go.” Ning
willed it, and instantly, a giant phantom of a bear’s head appeared
out of nowhere within the room. It opened its mouth, swallowing the
seated Ning within it. And, just like that, Ning disappeared..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main hall in
the underwater estate. The giant prayer mats were there, the same as
ever. Ning casually chose one of them, taking a seat in the lotus
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, kid, why’ve
you returned so soon after your last trip?” The old black bull
looked at Ning. At this moment, the giant yellow bear suddenly
materialized as well. “He’s about to make his breakthrough. If he
were to make it in his own room, it would probably be destroyed. In
addition, to be a bit more cautious, he decided to come here, to the
underwater estate, which naturally would be the safest place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position, having absorbed his magic robes into his body,
leaving it completely nude. “Let it begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he had already
grasped the essence of it, Ning immediately began to activate the
principles of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon Ning’s bared
back, the Divine Solar Tattoo and the Divine Lunar Tattoo all
suddenly lit up with incomparable brilliance. They instantly began to
resonate with those two most supreme of celestial bodies, the Solar
Star and the Lunar Star, which were located an unfathomable distance
away and separated by countless realms. The Solar Star and the Lunar
Star instantly began to send out a stream of Solar Truefire and Lunar
Truewater towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To advance from the
ninth stage to the tenth stage was a major leap between realms. With
each major transformation, the Solar Star and the Lunar Star would
provide their assistance, causing the divine body to become
transformed once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Breakthroughs via
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] truly are special.”
The giant yellow bear stared at the lotus flowers, stamen, and petals
that had appeared around Ning, all of which looked just like real
ones. Ning was completely enfolded within the lotus flower. “Each
time, there will be Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater to assist.
This sort of divine body will thus have the potential to control
Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To advance from
earthfire and dire-ice to skyfire and sky-ice, then to Solar Truefire
and Lunar Truewater…” The nearby black bull shook his head. “That
is all too far off. Generally speaking, only Celestial Immortals and
Empyrean Gods have the chance to control Solar Truefire and Lunar
Truewater…and that’s just a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cultivator had to
start by nurturing earthfire, then slowly improve it step by step,
painstakingly nourishing it to the point of it becoming Solar
Truefire when the cultivator became a Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s almost
finished,” the giant yellow bear said. Indeed. The Waterflame Lotus
surrounding Ning was beginning to turn translucent; clearly, the
truefire and truewater within had slowly been completely absorbed by
Ning. The translucent petals of the Waterflame Lotus slowly opened,
revealing Ning within the heart of the lotus. Every single part of
Ning’s body was incomparably perfect; it was the body of a
Fiendgod!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes,
and the fur clothes appeared on his body. They still appeared just
like the ones his mother had made for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I broke through,”
Ning said with a smile. What massive, majestic divine power. His
entire body coursed with a flood of strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the ninth stage, he
was only comparable to regular, early Wanxiang Fiendgod Refiners. But
at the tenth stage, he was already comparable to late Wanxiang
Fiendgod Refiners! Most importantly of all…after every three
stages, there would be a major gap, and passing through each gap was
extremely hard. The three mini-stages were much easier to advance
through; one only had to absorb enough solar power and lunar power in
order to break through. Thus, there would be no bottlenecks for Ning
as he advanced from the tenth to the twelfth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have the Fiendgod
body of a late Wanxiang Adept, and have mastered the third stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword]!” Ning mused to himself, “And, with the
divine ability, [Starseizing Hand]…my current level of power is
significantly greater than it was back in the wild marshes of the
Gaol Mountains. If I were to once more encounter a Primal-level
Dragonwhale Diremonster, it wouldn’t be too hard for me to fight
against him head on. And, I most likely should be on par with senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow,” Ning thought to himself
delightedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of Fiendgod
bodies, Bloodshadow was merely at the peak Wanxiang stage; Ning was
comparable to being at the late Wanxiang stage, and was just slightly
weaker. However, he had a far more powerful divine ability! And, with
the help of his swordplay…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given my current
level of power, I can fight against Primal Daoists now. Even if I
cannot overcome them, I should be able to escape,” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
giant yellow bear spoke out. “Senior.” Ning looked towards him.
“Since your foundation has improved, your power has naturally
improved as well,” the giant yellow bear said. “If you were to go
re-challenge the third level of the Wargod Hall, even without relying
on archery, you would have a 100% chance of obtaining victory in
close quarters combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Then
if I were to go challenge the fourth level? Would I pass?” “The
chances of passing are less than ten percent,” the giant yellow
bear said. “Once your Fiendgod body reaches the eleventh stage, you
should have a 30% or 40% chance of victory. If you were to improve in
swordplay as well, then your chances would become still greater. To
overcome the fourth level of the Wargod Hall…generally speaking,
you’ll need to be powerful enough to defeat Primal Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly shake his head. Oh, Daoist Threelives…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bar he had set for
his successors really was too high. Even someone as monstrous as Ning
found it incredibly difficult; the former successor, Immortal Juhua,
really was unfortunate! He ended up becoming a Loose Immortal, and
only many years after doing so was he capable of defeating the
seventh stage and selecting an extremely powerful Immortal-ranked
magic treasure. Unfortunately…by then, it was too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. I’ll
challenge the fourth level of Wargod Hall next time,” Ning said
with a laugh. “I just made a breakthrough as a Fiendgod; I can be
considered to have reached the Wanxiang level formally now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded. “Yes.” Ning’s eyes lit up, blazing with eagerness.
“Then I now have another chance to choose a treasure from the
Treasures Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally. You will
only have a total of three choices each time, so you must be cautious
each time you do so; there’s no going back after you make your
choice,” the giant yellow bear said. “Come. Let’s go to the
Treasures Hall and slowly pick through the treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour later. After
having selected yet another treasure, and with his power greatly
improved, Ning quietly returned to Serpentwing Lake. No one knew that
within those two short hours, Ning had left Serpentwing lake.
Naturally, no one knew that Ning’s power had greatly improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. In the blink of an eye, a year had passed since Ninelotus had
arrived at Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Stillwater
City. The Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Qingqing!” In the skies above a mountain, a
black-suited youth was calling out in a high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud, it’s quite rare for you to come visit
me here.” A tall, willowy, silver-robed, maiden, Luo Qing, walked
out of her courtyard. Raising her head, she smiled towards the skies
as she spoke. The black-suited youth in the air immediately landed in
the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud, please sit,” Luo Qing said. The
black-uniformed youth sat down, then laughed, “I heard that
recently, junior apprentice-sister Qingqing, you came back from your
adventures, so I came to see how you are doing…as I recall, you and
junior apprentice-sister Ninelotus went out together. Why is it that
a year later, you returned but she did not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing hesitated a
moment, then said, “Chen Jin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-suited youth
was startled. Chen Jin was his true name; however, Qingqing usually
referred to him by his Daoist title, as ‘senior apprentice-brother
Flowcloud’. For her to address him by his actual name…she most
likely was going to discuss something important with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, me, and
Ninelotus, we all came to Stillwater City together,” Luo Qing said
in a low voice. “You and I both know about her background.” Chen
Jin nodded. “Of course I do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, when
senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus was in the Dongyan clan, you
continuously wooed her. When she brought me to Stillwater City and
the Black-White College, you decided to enter the Black-White College
as well…I know that your heart has continued to be infatuated with
her,” Luo Qing said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin laughed.
“Although Ninelotus has never nodded and accepted me, I’ll
continue to wait. Ten years, a hundred years…I’ll slowly wait for
her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s
something…” Luo Qing gritted her teeth. “…that I think I must
tell you about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Chen
Jin laughed. Luo Qing looked so unwilling to speak out; could it be
that she was about to confess feelings for him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing took a deep
breath. “Senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus has chosen a
Dao-Companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But unfortunately…it
isn’t you.” Luo Qing looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though a
thunderbolt had fallen out of the clear skies, completely stunning
Chen Jin.

Chapter 23 - Holyfire
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did you say?”
Chen Jin stared at Luo Qing, an incomparably terrifying look in his
eyes. “Say it again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing knew Chen Jin
very well. She naturally could guess at what Chen Jin was currently
feeling, and she immediately said with solemnity, “I said…that
senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus has already chosen a
Dao-Companion. She’s chosen someone else, not you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin’s face was
ashen, and his body swayed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity,” Luo Qing
murmured to herself secretly. They had been friends for many years,
and so she couldn’t bear for Chen Jin to be kept in the dark.
However, she also knew exactly what a blow this was for Chen Jin to
hear. “He pursued her for so many years without success. In the
end, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, who didn’t even pursue her,
ended up attracting her attention.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin shook his
head. “Impossible. Ninelotus is the future Matriarch of the Dongyan
clan; she has tremendous expectations for her future. Not even the
many geniuses of the Black-White College have ever attracted her
attention. Soundless and silently, she suddenly selected a
Dao-Companion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His name is Ji
Ning,” Luo Qing said. “He’s our junior apprentice-brother. His
Daoist title is Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth?” Chen Jin was stunned. Ji Ning, also
known as Adept Darknorth, was quite resoundingly famous within the
Black-White College. When this crazy junior apprentice-brother had
first joined, in the Dao Debates, his performance had been such that
the reincarnated Immortal, Rainbowflame Fairy Yu Wei, had been forced
to personally intervene to overcome him. However, back then, Chen Jin
had been carrying out a mission for the Raindragon Guard, and so
hadn’t been in the College and hadn’t met Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he knew very
well…for him to have been so powerful immediately after joining the
school, and to have been selected by Immortal Diancai as a disciple,
this person, Ji Ning, would definitely be one of the most supreme
disciples of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” Chen Jin
couldn’t help but say, “How can that be? How long have they even
known each other? Ninelotus is the future Matriarch of the Dongyan
tribe; she’s extremely cautious by nature, and she considers all of
her actions thoroughly. Even if truly she were to choose a
Dao-Companion, she would be more prudent than prudence itself in
doing so. It is precisely this temperament of hers that has led the
various Immortals of the Dongyan clan to jointly concur on her as
their choice. Even though her background is astonishing, it alone
wouldn’t be enough for her to be selected as the next leader. Given
her temperament…she couldn’t possibly have chosen a Dao-Companion
this quickly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luo Qing nodded. “You
understand her very well. The choice of a Dao-Companion is a choice
that will change one’s life. Indeed, she didn’t come to a
decision this quickly. I’ll tell you something…she’s already
spent an entire year with Ji Ning, in the secluded Serpentwing Lake
of Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s spent a full
year with Ji Ning in his secluded residence?” Chen Jin’s face
changed. There was no man who could accept the fact that the woman he
loved had been living with another man for a full year! The same was
true for Immortal cultivators! In fact, the purity of an Immortal
cultivator’s Dao-heart made it so that they were far more
terrifyingly stubborn than most mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if they were
together for a year?” Chen Jin suppressed the rage in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus and I first arrived there, we spent three
months there, and I left,” Luo Qing said. “I’m a woman as well;
I could sense what senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus was feeling.
After just three months…she was already beginning to show hints of
bashfulness on her face. Now that a year has passed…I can’t even
guess at how far the relationship between her and Ji Ning has
developed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin’s face was
as lifeless as steel! He was completely dazed, and his mind was in a
state of chaos.. Bashfulness? Three months? Now a year? How far the
relationship had developed? What had happened? Could it be that the
two of them had already…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“IMPOSSIBLE!” Chen
Jin let out a growl, then transformed into a streak of light, flying
into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching him fly away,
Luo Qing couldn’t help but shake her head. “He actually lost
composure this badly. It seems this truly was a major blow to him. I
really didn’t want to tell you, but I had to…telling you now
means that you’ll have a chance to fight for her. If I were to tell
you in a few years…you would probably have no hope at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as she was
personally concerned, given that she, Ninelotus, and Flowcloud had
all come to Stillwater City together, she naturally felt extremely
close to both of them. Between Ji Ning and Flowcloud…she naturally
was biased towards Flowcloud, Chen Jin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin flew blindly
through the skies, confusion raging in his mind. “No, no, I can’t…I
can’t continue like this. I need to immediately go to the place
where Ji Ning is living, to that Serpentwing Lake place in Swallow
Mountain. Right now! Immediately! This very moment!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panic. Worry. Unease.
These emotions tore at his breast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flowcloud, come in.”
A voice suddenly rang out in his mind, carrying a hint of meditative
dhyana; it actually was able to instantly suppress the turbulent
emotions in Chen Jin’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire?” Chen
Jin was stunned. He looked ahead of himself, towards a mountain peak
and the scarlet red estate built atop it. This was the residence of
one of the leaders of the third generation disciples of the
Black-White College - Holyfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, my mind was
in a state of chaos. I actually unconsciously made my way to Uncle
Fire’s place. It seems as though…my heart subconsciously felt
that this was the safest, most secure place for me in the entire
Black-White College?” Chen Jin immediately flew into the estate
below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome, elegant
looking bald youth, dressed in a fiery red robe, was seated in the
lotus position, his feet bare. He seemed almost crystalline in his
incomparable purity, and yet he also seemed to blaze like a flame,
causing the temperature in the surrounding area to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire.” Chen
Jin walked in. Although both he and Holyfire were third generation
disciples, in terms of age, Holyfire was more than a century older
than him. When he was but a child, Holyfire had already been a
prominent figure amongst the other third generation disciples of the
Black-White College. Because Holyfire was on extremely good terms
with his clan, the Chen clan, ever since Chen Jin had been young, he
had addressed him as ‘Uncle Fire’. Even after he himself had
joined the Black-White College, he continued to address Holyfire in
this way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can tell that your
aura is disturbed, and a look of chaos and wildness is in your eyes.
If this continues, your Dao-heart will be damaged.” Holyfire shook
his head. “What exactly has happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire, I, I…”
Chen Jin found it difficult to speak. Holyfire let out a calm laugh.
In terms of Dao-heart and comprehension, there were actually even
many Primal Daoists who were inferior to him. In terms of pure power,
there were even some Primal Daoists who had been defeated by him! In
addition, Holyfire had already made his preparations…in the next
few years, he was going to make his breakthrough to the Primal Daoist
level. In the entire Black-White College, of the third generation
disciples, only the Sloppy Daoist was able to suppress him in might.
This wasn’t because Holyfire wasn’t strong; it was because the
Sloppy Daoist was truly too much of a monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Wanxiang Adepts
who were reincarnated Immortals were completely convinced of the
Sloppy Daoist’s superiority. He, and he alone, was acknowledged by
all as the number one figure amongst the third generation disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, monsters like
the Sloppy Daoist only came once in countless years. In addition,
they had a chance at becoming Celestial Immortals. In any other era,
someone like Holyfire, who was capable of defeating Primal Daoists as
a Wanxiang Disciple, would have already been considered the number
one figure amongst the third generation disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Holyfire
said. His voice seemed to carry a power to calm the hearts of others.
Chen Jin nodded. “It is because of Ninelotus. Uncle Fire, as you
know, Ninelotus and I grew up together, and our parents are good
friends with each other.” Having calmed down, Chen Jin began to
slowly narrate everything, but towards the end, he couldn’t help
but begin to grow frantic once more. “…but she’s now spent a
full year at Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain! That’s Ji Ning’s
place. I, I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic,”
Holyfire said calmly. “Panicking won’t help solve the situation;
thus, why panic? Your Dao-heart is insufficiently tempered. Romantic
love between men and women can result in an emotional tribulation. If
you trap yourself too deeply within it, then when you encounter the
Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, you will most likely suffer
greatly for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was shocked
into awareness by these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you
can’t possibly wait, however, so…I’ll come with you. Let me
take a look and see what techniques this junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning has used to attract the attention of that child, Ninelotus,”
Holyfire said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire, you’ll
come with me?” Chen Jin revealed a look of joy. Chen Jin had joined
the Raindragon Guard long ago, and was extremely powerful amongst the
third generation disciples of the Black-White College; he was only
inferior to the most monstrous of the other disciples. The
reincarnated Immortal, Yu Wei, was slightly stronger than him as
well; he could be considered to be one of the top ten disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was, of course, in
reference to real combat power. Thus, Chen Jin was actually quite
talented…and why he was always extremely self-confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very soon, a fiery
cloud arose. Atop it stood two figures; Holyfire and Chen Jin. They
rapidly soared into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was spring, now. The
days were warm, and the flowers were blooming. A boat was lazily
drifting atop the waters of Serpentwing Lake. Ning was lying down
within the boat, sleeping blissfully. There was another person within
the boat…Ninelotus, who was seated within it. Ninelotus sat there,
looking quietly at the sleeping Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them had
become extremely familiar with each other, to the point where they
could faintly sense the joy each felt for the other’s presence. But
the selection of a Dao-Companion…both Ninelotus and Ji Ning were
hesitant. Choosing a Dao-Companion was an incomparably important
decision. Ninelotus was the next leader of the Dongyan clan, while
Ning was the heir to the underwater estate; he had already cast his
vision beyond the limits of this major world, and his goal was to
roam the Three Realms and become a major power within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of these two were
extremely ambitious, and their Dao-hearts were extremely resolute.
Thus, neither of them would casually choose a Dao-Companion.
However…for Ning to be willing to allow Ninelotus to accompany him
in floating in the waters of Serpentwing Lake represented certain
thoughts and feelings that Ning felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…truly like
sleeping in the embrace of his parents?” Ninelotus mused silently
to herself. Because Ning often liked to lie on that boat and drift on
the waters of Serpentwing Lake, Ninelotus had asked Autumn Leaf, “Why
is it that your young master often goes to lie on that boat and drift
around on Serpentwing Lake for an entire day?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ashes of his
parents were sprinkled atop Serpentwing Lake. Serpentwing Lake is
like his parents,” Autumn Leaf had said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some
reason…Ninelotus had felt a twinge of pain in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were to lose my
parents?” Ninelotus thought of her own father and mother. Both of
them were alive, and her elders were all tremendously powerful. “Ji
Ning, he…” Ninelotus couldn’t help but stretch out her hand,
gently stroking Ning’s face with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
sleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus gently helped
Ning adjust his hair. She watched there, quietly, feeling an unusual
calmness in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair. A fiery
cloud was flying towards them at high speed, and atop it were two
figures. Both of them stared downwards. As they did, they immediately
saw that little boat floating atop Serpentwing Lake. Ning was lying
there, within that small boat, his head next to Ninelotus, who sat
next to him, helping him comb his hair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus!” Chen
Jin, aboard the fiery cloud, instantly turned red-eyed as he saw
this.

Chapter 24 - Burning With Jealousy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had grown up
together, and he had followed her all the way from Highwater
Commandery to Stillwater Commandery and entered the Black-White
College with her. After having pursued her for so long, how could
Chen Jin not be infuriated by what he saw in front of him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flowcloud.” The
nearby Holyfire grabbed Chen Jin by the arm, pulling him towards him.
Chen Jin had been about to charge out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire.” Chen
Jin turned to look at him. Holyfire looked back, gaze as calm as
ever. “Calm down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin said,
agonized, “How can I possibly calm down. I have to ask and
understand exactly what the hell is Ninelotus thinking. Why would she
take a fancy to this kid, Ji Ning?” Although they were fellow
disciples, Chen Jin was currently filled with boundless disgust and
distaste for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll only have a
chance if you can calm down.” Holyfire looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin wasn’t a
fool; he had simply been provoked by the scene before him. He quickly
suppressed his rage, then nodded and said, “Uncle Fire, don’t
worry. I won’t do anything crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. No matter
what, we are all fellow disciples of the same school. We cannot
commit fratricide against each other,” Holyfire instructed. “Come.
Let’s go meet with junior apprentice-brother Darknorth and junior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin obediently
followed by his side as the two flew downwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the boat. A surge
of power was rippling down towards them from the skies. Ninelotus
couldn’t help but look upwards, and the ripple of power caused Ning
to awaken from his slumber and open his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?” Ning
immediately recognized the bald, handsome, crimson-robed, bare-footed
youth who had a divine svastika tattoo in the middle of his forehead.
A look of surprise appeared on Ning’s face. “Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire? Why has he suddenly come to my place?
There shouldn’t be many people who know that I am here at
Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire had mastered a
complete Dao Path, and whose Fiendgod body had reached the peak of
the Wanxiang level long ago. He had even defeated Primal Daoists
before. He was one of the true leaders of the third generation
disciples of the Black-White College!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, senior apprentice-brother Flowcloud.”
The nearby Ninelotus’ face suddenly changed. “He actually came…it
seems Qingqing must’ve told him. This will be troublesome.” As
soon as she saw the two, Ninelotus was able to guess at what had
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninelotus hurriedly sent to him, “Next to senior apprentice-brother
Holyfire is senior apprentice-brother Flowcloud! Be careful of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful of him?
He should be one of our fellow disciples, right? Although I’ve
never met him, I’ve heard of his name and that he is very powerful.
Why should I be careful of him?” Ning was puzzled; he had never met
Flowcloud before, and no enmity existed between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just be careful.”
Ninelotus gritted her teeth. Right at this moment, Holyfire and Chen
Jin flew down from the skies, landing atop the water. The two strode
forward atop the water as easily as if they were walking on flat
land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brothers Holyfire and Flowcloud,” Ning laughed, “Why
have the two of you come to my Swallow Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire smiled at him.
“We learned that you were here by chance,” Holyfire said. As for
Chen Jin, he just let out a cold snort, not speaking. This caused
Ning to feel surprised…he had never offended this man before. Why
was he treating Ning so coldly? Just now, Ninelotus had also warned
him to be wary of Flowcloud…it seemed there really were some
strange things going on. Multiple thoughts instantly began to flit
through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve come
to my place, senior fellow disciples, I naturally will show the
hospitality of a host. Senior fellow disciples, please come with me,”
Ning said warmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” The
black-suited Chen Jin gave a cold response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. No matter
how good-tempered he was, he wouldn’t try to ingratiate himself to
someone who was treating him icily. “Oh, then why have you come to
my place, senior apprentice-brother Flowcloud?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire gently shook
his head, not saying anything. As for Chen Jin, he looked at
Ninelotus. He stared directly into her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but begin to feel anger rise in his heart. After having been together
with her for a year, Ning had begun to understand how Ninelotus felt,
and the two of them had reached a tacit level of understanding. They
hadn’t felt the need to rush into open proclamations, but…Ning
naturally felt quite upset for this Chen Jin to stare so fixedly at
‘his’ senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud,” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
Chen Jin gave him an angry glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze instantly
turned sharp. Although he had been angry, he had at least been able
to maintain a level of decorum. But this Flowcloud telling him to
shut his mouth was a clear sign that he intended to give Ning no face
at all. If that was the case, then he had no need to give him any
face either. He immediately barked back, “Flowcloud, this is my
territory. This isn’t a place for you to throw your weight around.
Get the f*ck out of Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was startled
by Ning’s shout, and he immediately said with fury, “You think
you are capable of making me leave? You don’t know your own
limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nearby
Holyfire, he just watched quietly. Ninelotus, however, could no
longer hold back. “Chen Jin!” Ninelotus barked angrily. Chen Jin,
pain in his eyes, turned to look at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus, leave
this to me,” Ning said. Although Flowcloud was famous, Ning truly
didn’t hold him in any regard. Amongst Wanxiang Disciples, only the
truly most top-tier experts such as Holyfire were capable of
inspiring caution in Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me handle it.”
Ninelotus shook her head, staring at Chen Jin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin, agonized,
looked back at her. “Little Yun, you’ve really made up your
mind?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus let out a
light sigh. She had grown up with Chen Jin, after all. “Chen Jin,
stop being so stubborn. Let it go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let it go?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let it go?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let it go?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three words
continuously echoed in Chen Jin’s mind, causing the last vestiges
of hope thad he had in his mind to instantly be exterminated. His
face changed, beginning to redden as he pointed towards Ning and
howled, “Because of HIM!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chen Jin!”
Ninelotus immediately barked at him but Chen Jin said, agonized,
“Little Yun, we grew up together. When we were young, you always
liked to be together with me as well, right? Because of you, I left
Highwater Commandery and came to join the Black-White College of
Stillwater Commandery! You should know that my departure from
Highwater Commandery had a major impact on my status within the
tribe, but for your sake, I didn’t hesitate at all. I sacrificed so
much, and in all these years, I’ve never wavered in my feelings
towards you. You…you…you…this is how you are going to treat
me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, standing there,
finally understood. So the two of them had known each other as
children…but so what? Did they necessarily have to become
Dao-Companions, just because they had grown up together?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chen Jin.”
Ninelotus shook her head. “I’ve never accepted you, despite the
passage of all these years. How can you not understand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understand what?”
Chen Jin let out a cold laugh. “You just grew fickle-hearted!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was stunned.
As for Chen Jin, a cold light flashed through his eyes. His many
years of pursuit had resulted in such an ending…his final hopes had
been extinguished. The jealousy that he had previously felt was
completely transformed into rage! He was enraged…enraged that all
of his sacrifices over the years had were like water that flowed east
into the sea, never to return. Enraged that Ninelotus had actually
taken a fancy to this kid from a minor clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to say
anything else.” Chen Jin looked at Ninelotus. “Dongyan Yun, after
today, I will never bother you again. However, your judgment truly is
terrible for you to have taken a fancy to this kid! We’ve been
friends for so many years…today, I’ll help you out and let you
know how utterly worthless this kid you’ve taken a fancy to is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Chen Jin
let out a loud roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…instantly, the
air above Serpentwing Lake instantly exploded with noise. At the same
time, a large number of clouds began to gather, and the entire world
seemed to change color. Around the black-suited Chen Jin, 108 golden
disks of light suddenly appeared out of nowhere, all of which
immediately flew towards the skies in every which way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clouds into the sky
also surged at high speed towards those 108 golden disks of light.
Soon, the clouds had transformed into a formation of 108 giant
clouds, which were shaped like lions, chariots, dragons, and other
creatures. These 108 giant clouds circled about the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Chen Jin, he
stood there in midair, staring towards the distant Ning and shouting,
“Ji Ning, if you have even the slightest bit of courage, then come
battle with me. I’ll let Ninelotus know…that you will crumple at
a single blow. But of course, if you have no courage, if you are
afraid, then just hurry up and get the hell away from Ninelotus. You
aren’t worthy of her!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chen Jin!”
Ninelotus was angry now as well. But the nearby Ning stretched out
his arm, stopping her. Ninelotus couldn’t help but turn to look at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ning only said these four words. Ninelotus felt her heart tremble;
she could sense Ning’s determination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The changes to the
world near Serpentwing Lake and the sudden appearance of these 108
giant clouds had thrown Brightheart Island into a state of chaos.
Many people charged out, and even Patriarch Ninefire, Granny Shadow,
and the old servant Ah Xing came out to see what was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s happened?
Who is causing trouble here at our Serpentwing Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
shocked and mystified. Ninefure, Granny Shadow, and Autumn Leaf all
looked towards the Whitewater Hound and the Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That red-robed man
is named Holyfire; he’s one of the leaders of the third generation
disciples of the Black-White College. He’s extremely powerful, and
supposedly has even defeated Primal Daoists,” the Whitewater Hound
said. “Next to Holyfire is another disciple of the Black-White
College; his name is Flowcloud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they are all
disciples of the Black-White College, what’s there to fight about?”
Autumn Leaf said, worried, “Is the young master alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning’s already
sent a message to me. Don’t worry,” the Whitewater Hound said.
But although he said that, he was very worried as well, because he
had spent quite a long period of time in the Black-White College and
heard of Flowcloud’s reputation. In addition, the grand aura of the
technique which Flowcloud had just used was proof that his power was
unfathomably greater than the likes of Dong One and Northriver Zhou.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a true elite
of the Black-White College!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, be
careful,” the Whitewater Hound sent mentally to him. Ning’s soul
was so powerful that he could engage in a spiritual communication
with his spirit-beast as long as they were in range of his divine
sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus looked at
Ning, worry in her gaze. Although she knew that Ning was monstrously
talented, he had still only been in the Black-White College for five
years. Flowcloud, also known as ‘Chen Jin’, was also extremely
talented and had been training for many years, and was shockingly
strong. She was very worried that the two would truly engage in a
wild, murderous battle against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Chen Jin,
in midair, saw the look of worry on her face. He couldn’t help but
let out a cold snort. “Ji Ning, dare you or dare you not? If you
don’t have the courage to fight, then f*ck off and go back to your
little clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chen Jin.” Ning
strode through the air, one step at a time, moving higher and higher
with each step. As he did, he spoke calmly, “It seems that your
embarrassment has transformed into anger. Becoming Dao-Companions is
a personal matter for two individuals; can it be that just because
you were stubborn in your pursuit, that Ninelotus has to accept you?
You think a bit too highly of yourself. As for you saying that you
wish for Ninelotus to know how utterly worthless I am, that I can’t
stand up to a single blow…once again, I’m afraid you think a bit
too highly yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough bullshit. Do
you dare to fight or not?” Chen Jin stared at the distant Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
through the air, soon coming to stand at an equal level to Chen Jin.
The two stood there in midair, staring at each other. A Darknorth
sword suddenly appeared in Ning’s hands. A sword-hum rang out,
filling the air above Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then,” Ning
said calmly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 25 - Ji Ning Battles Chen Jin
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two stood there in
midair. As for Holyfire and Ninelotus, they stood atop the water,
heads raised, watching them. Ninelotus sent frantically, “Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, aren’t you going to stop Chen Jin?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire, head raised,
continued to watch. He sent back calmly, “Chen Jin wooed you for
many years. The rage generated from the instant eradication of a
dream held for many years is quite astonishingly great; it’s best
to let him give vent to it. After doing so, in the future, it will
cast less of a shadow on his heart. If he has to completely suppress
his feelings, in the future, it will prove to be a disaster for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of
letting him give vent, you are going to make junior
apprentice-brother Ning suffer,” Ninelotus said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
Black-White College forbids its disciples from fratricide,”
Holyfire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
Black-White College does indeed forbid fratricide, as far as I can
tell, Chen Jin has gone completely mad. He’s capable of anything
right now. Although the College might punish him later, if he truly
does wound Ji Ning…what good would punishment do?” Ninelotus said
furiously, “Senior apprentice-brother Holyfire, you are very
powerful; you can stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire gave Ninelotus
a glance. “If something dangerous truly happens, I’ll intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m afraid that by
that time, it would be too late. They are Wanxiang Adepts, after all,
and you, senior apprentice-brother Holyfire, are a Wanxiang Adept as
well. Life and death can be determined in an instant…senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, you won’t necessarily be able to make
it in time,” Ninelotus shouted back mentally. She wanted to give
Holyfire more pressure, hoping that he might intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire just raised
his head, continuing to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Chen Jin
were in midair, staring at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid of a puny clan,
so you actually have the courage to battle me.” Chen Jin let out a
cold laugh, then sent mentally, “But this will make you all the
more aware of your foolishness!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faint flames could be
seen burning in Ning’s eyes as well now. The flames of rage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let you know
how weak you are, how puny you are, how worthless you are!” Chen
Jin’s eyes were filled with savagery. “In terms of clans, the
Chen clan of Highwater Commandery is unfathomably more powerful than
your puny little backwater clan. In terms of parentage, both your
parents are dead, while my father is a Primal Daoist! In terms of
personal power, I’m one of the top ten third generation disciples
of the Black-White College, but you? You are merely a junior disciple
who just entered a few years ago. Now, let me, your senior
apprentice-brother, help you wake up and understand…that compared
to me, you are a pile of shit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice rang out by
Ning’s ear. Ning’s face became extremely ugly to behold…these
were the words of a disciple of the Black-White College?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed, even
Immortal cultivators who are normally calm, reserved, and aloof, upon
going berserk, can become thousands of times uglier and more
unsightly than evil commoners.” Rage was now truly burning in
Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparing clans?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparing parents?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparing personal
power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reference to his
parents had particularly enraged Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chen Jin, you’ve
always chased after Ninelotus, but she never paid any attention to
you, right?” Ning sent back, his voice mocking, “You chased her
for so many years, but she never paid you any attention, and yet you
still weren’t wise enough to just give up. I feel embarrassed on
your behalf! Just look at yourself. Take a good look at yourself…look
at how ugly you look right now, with that angry look on your face.
Honestly…you are worse than a pile of shit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words struck
straight at Chen Jin’s weakness. Ninelotus had never shown him any
interest…there was no way he could refuse this. As far as
relationships went, Ninelotus had already chosen Ning; this meant
that Ning was the victor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really deserve
to die!” Chen Jin’s eyes flashed with savage light. “Wind!”
Chen Jin suddenly let out a great howl. The giant clouds that had
filled the skies instantly began to glow with streaks of light which
condensed around Chen Jin’s body, forming into a gigantic azure
bird-of-paradise. The massive azure bird-of-paradise proudly raised
its head, the plumage atop its head clearly visible, as well as the
arrogance in its eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to me, you
are nothing!” Chen Jin sent a furious mental roar to Ning, while at
the same time, the gigantic azure bird-of-paradise charged at high
speed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair. “Hmph.” Ning let out a cold snort. The area around him
instantly became filled with a large number of flying swords. In the
center of the mass of flying swords were those nine black Nethercold
swords, which had caused the power of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] to rise by a full level. Light began to glow from the
flying swords, and soon, a jade sword of light appeared before Ning.
This was the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!” Ning let
out an explosive roar. The jade sword of light instantly slashed
through the skies, and as it did, the vague outlines of a tri-colored
lotus could be seen. Ning had already reached the ‘Dao Domain’
level in the Dao of Rainwater, the Dao of the Inferno, and the Dao of
the Gale. The power of his Tripartite Lotus Sword had also reached an
astonishing level, and the attack of this sword was filled with some
of the mysteries of the Grand Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light
flashed, and as it did, it was as though a dragon had appeared in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the azure
bird-of-paradise charging down at high speed instantly collided with
the dragon of sword-light. It was just like Chef Ding carving the ox
1; the sword-light sliced seamlessly through the azure
bird-of-paradise, causing it to be instantly chopped apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” A look of
shock appeared on Holyfire’s face. He knew exactly how strong Chen
Jin was; Chen Jin could be said to be one of the top ten figures of
the third generation disciples of the Black-White College. “Although
that attack wasn’t his strongest, it was one of his more formidable
techniques; how could it have been suppressed by Ji Ning? In
addition, Ji Ning used flying swords, not close-quarters combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, by
Holyfire’s side, was similarly shocked. She had no idea as to
exactly how strong Ning was in real combat, because during this year
at Serpentwing Lake, Ning had never truly exploded forth with his
full power in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He
actually…actually…” Ninelotus couldn’t believe it. “Can it
be that Ji Ning is going to defeat Chen Jin?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and the others on Brightheart Island all felt extremely
nervous. This combat between two Wanxiang Adepts was a world-shaking
battle to them, and the power of these blows vastly outstripped the
might that had been on display during their previous battle at Oxhorn
Mountain. Everyone, including Autumn Leaf, Bluestone, Uncle White,
and Qingqing, felt extremely nervous. However, upon seeing Ning’s
sword-light chop through the azure bird-of-paradise, they all felt
relieved. “It seems he’s going to win.” The Whitewater Hound
nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the midair Chen
Jin, his face was completely ashen. He had wanted to teach Ning a
vicious lesson in front of Ninelotus and trample over him, so as to
let Ninelotus know how worthless this Ji Ning was, and that he, Chen
Jin, was the truly powerful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin knew very well
that in the world of Immortal cultivators, strength determined a
person’s true status; everything else was meaningless. He wanted to
use his own strength to show that he was more powerful than this kid,
Ji Ning, which Ninelotus had taken a fancy to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could…” Chen
Jin couldn’t accept this outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, winds! Come,
clouds!” Chen Jin suddenly let out a savage roar. Instantly, the
skies once more began to gather power, and two creatures
simultaneously appeared; an enormous azure bird-of-paradise, and a
pure, golden divine dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bird-of-paradise
and the divine dragon coiled about each other, a shocking aura of
power radiating from them. They charged directly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!” The distant
Ning once more let out a cold, angry bark. The power of the ninth
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] once more exploded
forth. This time, the jade sword of light seemed to be like a
painter’s brush, swiping outwards in an arc that was so beautiful
as to cause the heart to tremble…and as it painted a streak of
light through the skies, an astonishingly sharp sword-flash appeared
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] - Sudden Sword Light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Holyfire
was watching this from down below, and upon seeing this technique,
his eyes instantly turned completely round. “The [Three-Foot Sword]
- Sudden Sword Light!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…!”
Ninelotus was shocked as well. They were both disciples of the
Black-White College, and the first six stances of the [Three-Foot
Sword] had been passed down for many years; they naturally all
recognized this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light
suddenly appeared, carrying an invincible aura of majesty and power.
Although the bird-of-paradise and the divine dragon mutually
reinforced each other, filling each other with power and flexibility,
in the face of this sword attack, which seemed to fill the world with
its aura…they were still chopped into two halves, completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword]?” Chen Jin’s eyes were filled with
disbelief as well. “Impossible. This is completely impossible.
There’s no way his swordplay can be this powerful. He’s just
joined recently; how could he have already comprehended the third
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]? And even if he did master it, he
still shouldn’t be a match for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I reached the peak
of the Wanxiang level long ago, and have the support of the Cloudwind
Formation. The treasures used to form this formation, my father
personally gathered for me…this formation is formed from 108
high-grade Earth-ranked magic treasures. Their power is definitely no
weaker than a divine ability’s.” Chen Jin shook his head, his
eyes filled with disbelief. “Although his swordplay is powerful,
the third stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]…it should only be
slightly more powerful than my attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was, after all, one
of the top ten figures of the third generation disciples. He knew
exactly how strong the [Three-Foot Sword] was. The fourth stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] was comparable in power to complete mastery
over a Dao Path. The third stance, however, was a level lower in
might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Black-White
College, only Holyfire, the Sloppy Daoist, and a very few others were
at a higher level of comprehension than Ning. The power of this sword
attack alone was already enough for Ning to rank alongside Chen Jin
and the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei, as one of the top ten disciples
of the third generation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning let
out a cold laugh. It seemed as though Chen Jin found this to be
unfathomable?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin’s ‘Cloudwind
Formation’ had been famous for many years, but Ning’s own [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] was also extremely powerful. By relying on
the nine Nethercold swords, Ning was capable of unleashing tremendous
power as well, and thus had been able to suppress his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. You, a
brat from a backwater clan…how can you compare to me?” Chen Jin’s
face was filled with savagery. “I’m definitely going to beat you
to your knees. Beat you until you submit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the only
thought in Chen Jin’s mind. He had to defeat Ji Ning; he had to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudwind
Worldchains!” Chen Jin let out a furious howl. But right at this
moment, a pair of black wings suddenly appeared on Ning’s back. The
black wings trembled, and Ning instantly charged forward like a
streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, many
chains of azure light and golden light were sweeping forward, seeking
to wrap around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Ning’s
Darknorth sword flashed out. Ning’s Fiendgod body had already
reached the tenth stage; he was comparable to a normal late-stage
Wanxiang Adept Fiendgod, and he was using his divine ability, the
[Starseizing Hand]! Ning would even dare give Holyfire a battle, much
less this Chen Jin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
azure chains and golden chains were completely shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Chen Jin,
shocked, wanted to dodge. But how could he possibly do so?! Ning’s
left hand suddenly stretched out like the hand of a Fiendgod,
grabbing Chen Jin around his throat, clenching around it. Chen Jin
gurgled but was unable to speak. His eyes were filled with shock and
horror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is the pile of
shit?” Ning, his hand around Chen Jin’s throat, barked coldly,
“Tell me…who is the pile of shit?”

Chapter 26 - Chen Jin’s Threat
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was being
choked by the throat. Ning’s left hand appeared ordinary, but it
contained power that was capable of tearing apart mountains; there
was no way Chen Jin could struggle at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…no…” Chen
Jin’s eyes were bloodshot. This was humiliation. His throat was
being choked by Ning; he felt humiliated, like he had never felt
humiliated before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know the
answer?” Ning continued to grip Chen Jin by the throat. He said
coldly, “Then I’ll tell you the answer. YOU are the pile of
shit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
fellow disciples, Ning felt nothing but boundless distaste for Chen
Jin. Ninelotus and Chen Jin were nothing more than old friends…what
business was it of Chen Jin as to who Ninelotus wished to become
Dao-Companions with? Because Ninelotus was interested in Ning, Chen
Jin was going to try to vent all of his anger on him? He had held
Ning in no regard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it weren’t for
the fact that we are forbidden from committing fratricide, I wouldn’t
let you off this easily.” Ning continued to clench Chen Jin by the
throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’d dare to kill
me? Do you dare? Do you dare?” Chen Jin stared at Ning, eyes filled
with madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill you? Kill you,
then be punished by the College?” Ning shook his head and let out a
cold laugh. “You aren’t worth it!” And then, Ning swung his
arm, exploding forth with the might of his Fiendgod body and throwing
Chen Jin out like a meteor into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The events which had
transpired in midair caused Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the
others on Brightheart Island to feel incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s grown
stronger, stronger than in the past.” Ninefire’s eyes were
blazing with heat. “It’s only been a few years…although in the
past he was already able to easily slay a Wanxiang Adept, Adept Xu Li
was incomparably weaker than this student of the Black-White College.
However…even this powerful disciple of the Black-White College was
easily defeated by Ji Ning. Ji Ning’s advancement speed is simply
too fast. If this continues…in a few more decades, what will he be
like?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master…”
Autumn Leaf watched quietly as well, eyes filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too formidable.”
Qingqing blinked, somewhat dazed. Ning’s performance this time was
clearly far stronger than his previous one against the Dragonwhale
King. “No wonder, despite my countless strokes of good fortune, I
remain so much weaker than him. His rate of advancement is simply too
monstrous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin shot down from
the skies like a meteor, smashing into the waters of Serpentwing Lake
and arousing a wave that was three hundred meters high. However, he
quickly managed to steady himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flowcloud.” The
fiery-robed, bare-footed Holyfire walked over the waves, moving
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fire.” Chen
Jin lowered his head, an incomparably ugly look on his face. He had
never imagined…that he would lose so disastrously!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had wanted to let
Ninelotus see how powerful he was, and how worthless Ji Ning was! He
had wanted to completely dominate and trample this Ji Ning, so as to
give vent to his anger. Reality, however, was completely different
from what he had anticipated. He hadn’t defeated his enemy;
instead, he had been completely crushed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s innate
talent is indeed monstrous,” Holyfire sighed softly. “In the
past, when I watched him battle our fellow disciples in the Dao
Debates for the first time, I knew that he was monstrously
talented…but it seems I still underestimated him. Perhaps our
Black-White College is going to produce yet another senior
apprentice-brother Sloppy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? As if!” Chen
Jin couldn’t help but grit his teeth. The Sloppy Daoist…he was
universally acknowledged as the number one figure amongst the third
generation disciples of the Black-White College. Although he had
trained for many years, the Sloppy Daoist was someone who only became
more outstanding as the years went on. Generally speaking, Immortal
cultivators would find their rate of improvement lessen as time went
on, but the opposite was true for the Sloppy Daoist; he seemed to
contain endless, inexhaustible potential, causing him to make one
breakthrough after another. His combat power was even more
incomparably shocking. Even Fiendgod practitioners like Holyfire and
the various reincarnated Immortals were all completely convinced of
his superiority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment,
Holyfire had the feeling that this Ji Ning’s potential was enough
to make him the next ‘Sloppy Daoist’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Sloppy is like a raging wave that continues to
surge forward, building up power and becoming increasingly mighty as
it moves forward,” Holyfire said. “As for this Ji Ning, he’s
like a sharp sword, capable of chopping through all obstacles,
allowing him to advance at an inconceivable speed. This sort of
astonishing speed…even the reincarnated Immortals in our
Black-White College aren’t able to advance at such a rate. He’s
simply too monstrous!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin gritted his
teeth. The more Holyfire praised Ning, the more miserable he felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, do you
understand?” Holyfire looked athim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understand?” Chen
Jin looked at the distant Ji Ning, but his heart felt extremely
miserable. He felt stifled! Enraged! Unrepentant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had wooed Ninelotus
for many years, and his jealousy had transformed into rage! He had
wanted to viciously pummel Ning and give vent to his rage, then leave
in a carefree, relaxed manner. But instead, he had been dominated by
Ning, causing his pent-up anger to cause him to feel even more
miserable…this sort of agony caused Chen Jin to understand that a
shadow had fallen over his heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Chen Jin nodded, staring towards the distant Ning. Holyfire nodded
slightly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He, Ji Ning, has
cast a shadow over my heart. Unless I defeat him, unless I dominate
him, or unless he dies…it will be very hard for me to wipe out the
anger in my mind.” Chen Jin gritted his teeth. “I’ve never been
humiliated like this in my life. I’ve never felt so stifled, so
angry before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Holyfire
was astonished. He had thought that thanks to this defeat, Chen Jin
would regain his calm clarity of mind, but instead…Chen Jin was
sinker deeper and deeper into the morass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is terrible.”
Holyfire instantly understood his mistake. He had thought too highly
of Chen Jin. Chen Jin and Ninelotus were of the same age; they were
both very young, and were both proud, pampered scions of their clans;
thus, they had never suffered much. In addition, Chen Jin himself
truly was also an extremely, astonishingly talented individual; this
was why, even when Ninelotus had been at the Zifu Disciple stage, he
had already become one of the top ten members of the third generation
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was extremely
talented, and so had always been praised by others! The elders within
his clan had also encouraged him to woo Ninelotus and become her
Dao-Companion; after all, Ninelotus was the next leader of the
Dongyan clan, an ancient clan that was even more powerful than the
Chen clan and which was spread over three commanderies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he himself
truly did like her, and because of the encouragement of his elders,
and because of his self-confidence, Chen Jin had always believed that
eventually, he would become Ninelotus’ Dao-Companion! For her sake,
he even chose to join the Black-White College…he truly believed
that he had already sacrificed enough for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, Ninelotus had
chosen Ning, causing him to feel completely stunned, jealous, and
angry. He had planning to release his anger on Ning, but instead was
completely crushed…this sort of humiliation was something he had
never felt before in his entire life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning has cast a
shadow over my heart.” Chen Jin understood this point; he was an
extremely intelligent person, and upon realizing this, he immediately
grew frantic. “I want to become a Primal Daoist, and then become an
Immortal. I have to disperse this shadow. I have to!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do? Defeat him? Kill him?” Chen Jin couldn’t come
up with any ideas. Just now, they had already fought each other; he
was no match for Ning. As for causing Ning to die? Ning was a
disciple of the Black-White College, and the senior disciple of
Immortal Diancai. Who would dare kill him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?!”
Chen Jin shook his head. “No. I must immediately disperse this
shadow.” The humiliation and stifled rage which he felt caused him
to feel extremely agonized. He knew that these emotions would have an
enormous impact on his Immortal cultivation…but he wasn’t able to
sever this emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Knowing the problem was
one thing; being able to address it was another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Chen Jin
suddenly raised his head, staring towards Ning and Ninelotus, who
were chatting in midair. A savage light flashed through his eyes, and
with a swoosh, he immediately soared into the air once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was in a
dazed state right now. She had no idea that Ning had such tremendous
power. Chen Jin was one of the top ten third generation disciples of
the Black-White College, but he had been defeated so cleanly by Ning.
Didn’t that mean…that in the Black-White College, only the likes
of Holyfire and those few who had completely mastered a Dao Path were
a match for him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you…how
did you become so strong?” Once her words came out, Ninelotus began
to laugh at herself for saying such childish words. She hurriedly
changed her words, saying, “You defeated Chen Jin…I imagine that
he should leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he has come
to his senses.” Ning turned to look downwards, but as soon as his
words came out…a streak of light shot upwards from the ground. It
was Chen Jin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin flew into the
air, staring towards Ning and Ninelotus. He let out a cold laugh. “Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smirked. “Want
another fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin could feel his
anger begin to blaze up again, but he forced it down and growled, “Ji
Ning, I urge you to leave Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave?” Ning felt
quite amused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sighed. “Chen
Jin, you had best leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment,
Holyfire flew up towards them as well. However, he just stood to one
side, watching calmly and not saying anything. He hadn’t been able
to help Chen Jin; instead, a shadow had been cast over Chen Jin’s
heart. In truth…Holyfire felt rather vexed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was looking at
Ji Ning. He said in a cold voice, “You are indeed talented…but so
what if you are powerful? Your clan, the Ji clan, is too weak…it
doesn’t even have a single Wanxiang Adept. Annihilating this sort
of tribe is simply too easy, as easy as blowing a speck of dust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face sank.
“What do you mean by this!” Ning said in a cold voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know exactly
what I mean!” Chen Jin looked at Ning. “You had best leave
Ninelotus. Otherwise…don’t blame me for being vicious! I don’t
even need to do anything personally; I have plenty of tools at my
disposal for dealing with a small clan like the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face was
ashen, the color of iron. Threatening his clan? For the sake of the
clan…his father, the Patriarch, and the others all had been willing
to sacrifice their lives. Although, due to his former life, Ning
didn’t care as much about the clan as his parents and his elders,
because of their influence, he still cared quite a bit about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” A killing
desire began to surge within Ning’s mind. However, the Black-White
College restricted its disciples from committing fratricide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you are
a Raindragon Guard, and that ten thousand kilometers of the territory
of the Ji clan is protected by them.” Chen Jin looked at Ning.
“Anyone who dares violate your territory will definitely suffer
retaliation from the Raindragon Guard! However, in this vast world,
there are still many forces that don’t care at all about the
Raindragon Guard…such as those criminals which the Raindragon Guard
pursue. They are already wanted criminals; they won’t be worried
about offending the Raindragon Guard!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze flashed
with a cold light as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will have nothing
to do with me. The ones who will annihilate your Ji clan will be
those wanted criminals.” Chen Jin looked at Ning. “Honestly. It
will have nothing to do with me at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, as well,
understand…that the so-called ‘iron rule of law’ was something
which the supreme clans were capable of avoiding or skirting around.
The Raindragon Guard operated on the basis of proof; without proof,
the Raindragon Guard wouldn’t do anything to Chen Jin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin looked at
Ning, then said coldly, “Make your choice. Do you choose Ninelotus,
or do you choose your clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was enraged.
“Chen Jin, you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s cast a shadow
over my heart. To get rid of it, I will stop at nothing. Ninelotus,
you won’t be able to stop me.” Chen Jin looked towards Ning. “Ji
Ning, what will you choose? Speak!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black wings behind
Ning’s back suddenly flashed, and he transformed into a streak of
lightning as he charged straight towards Chen Jin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HALT!” Holyfire
roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*CK OFF!” Ning
let out a savage roar back, and a crushing wave of divine will
smashed outwards, striking directly against the soul of Holyfire, who
wanted to intervene and block him. Although Holyfire was powerful, he
wasn’t a reincarnated Immortal, and although both his soul and his
Dao-heart were powerful, he still felt his soul tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That moment’s
tremble…made him too late!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin, whose soul
had also been struck, wasn’t able to even use any magic treasures
before Ning’s hand once more clenched around his throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, his left hand
clenched around Chen Jin’s larynx, began delivering blows with his
right hand. “SLAP!” “SLAP!” “SLAP!” “SLAP!” “SLAP!”
“SLAP!” He viciously slapped Chen Jin on the face, and in a
single breath, he delivered tens of slaps. “Threaten me? You dare
THREATEN me? To boast of annihilating MY clan? You deserve to die. To
DIE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin’s face
instantly began to swell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you two
choices.” Ning came to a halt, giving a sideways glance to the
distant Holyfire. “Senior apprentice-brother Holyfire, don’t come
any closer, or I’ll immediately kill him.” Holyfire was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then continued to
look towards Chen Jin. “You have two choices. The first choice is
for you to swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens that you will
never cause any harm in any fashion to my Ji clan; otherwise, your
soul will instantly be shattered. The other choice…is for me to
shatter your soul right now. DECIDE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dare…you
actually dare kill one of your fellow disciples?!” Chen Jin stared
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You threatened to
annihilate my clan. You tell me; would I dare kill you or not?”
Ning stared at him. “Swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.
Otherwise, I’ll shatter your soul right now.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 27 - Traversing the Immortal Path Together
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Chen Jin
stared at Ji Ning, his eyes filled with astonishment. Previously,
Ning had appeared to be a very courteous, handsome, slim young man,
but now, he was no longer masking the killing intent in his eyes.
“If…if I don’t swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens…he’ll
kill me. He’ll definitely kill me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did indeed desire
to kill him now. He absolutely wouldn’t permit his own clan, the Ji
clan, to face annihilation. Whether for the sake of his father,the
sake of those clansmen who he cared about, or because he felt a
strong sense of belonging for the clan, Ning would definitely do
everything he could to preserve the clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I commit
fratricide against a fellow disciple and violate the laws of the
school, so what! I’ll accept the punishment!” This was what Ning
was thinking to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the school did
indeed forbid fratricide, if he actually were to kill Chen Jin…in
carrying out any punishment, the school would still first investigate
the details of the situation. For example, if a disciple of the
College sought to kill another disciple, could it be that the second
disciple would not be allowed to fight back? Thus, this rule against
fratricide was an internal rule of the College, and the exact
punishment for violators would be determined by the College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin had threatened
to annihilate the Ji clan…it was understandable for Ning to desire
to kill him. The College wouldn’t go so far as to destroy his Zifu;
however, he would most likely be sentenced to go into a confinement
of atonement for three hundred years, at the very least.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you choose?”
Ning stared at Chen Jin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Holyfire
felt quite startled and nervous as well. “This Ji Ning…he
actually is capable of using divine soul attacks. It seems he must
have reached the divine sense level long ago…and he’s also
extremely strong! Chen Jin has fallen into his hands, and he can kill
him with a thought; there’s no way I can save him in time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt somewhat
confident in being able to deal with Ji Ning. However…his advantage
in power over Ning was still limited; it could be said that the two
of them were on the same general level of power. To rescue Chen Jin
from Ning’s hands? It clearly wasn’t possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Chen
Jin’s entire body was quivering slightly; he felt both agonized and
humiliated. He finally spat out a phrase that he would never forget
for the rest of his life. “I am willing to swear an oath to the Dao
of the Heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew…” Holyfire
let out a sigh of relief. The distant Ninelotus, watching this, also
let out a sigh of relief. She had been nervous this entire time,
because this entire problem was due to her. Although she herself was
innocent in her actions, she still felt nervous and ashamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll speak first.
Repeat the words that I say in swearing your oath to the Dao of the
Heavens. You are not permitted to change a single word!” Ning
continued to grip Chen Jin by the neck as he said coldly, “Listen
clearly. I, Chen Jin, swear an oath right now, with the Dao of the
Heavens as my witness…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Chen Jin, swear
an oath right now, with the Dao of the Heavens as my witness…”
Although Chen Jin was unwilling, he still repeated every single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Invisible ripples of
power descended. These were ripples generated by the most supreme of
Daos, the Heavenly Daos. This meant that this oath had been
officially acknowledged by the Dao of the Heavens. Upon violating
this oath, one would have to face the punishment of the Dao! Even an
Immortal who violated such an oath would immediately suffer a
retributive attack, and if the Immortal had originally sworn that a
violation of the oath would cause his soul to be destroyed, then his
soul would indeed be destroyed and dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…and if I violate
this oath, then let the soul of myself, Chen Jin, immediately be
destroyed and dispersed, never to be reincarnated again.” Chen Jin
gritted his teeth as he stared at Ning. “Junior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning, are you satisfied?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a cold
laugh, then swung his hand. Swoosh! He tossed Chen Jin far away from
him. This time, Chen Jin managed to stabilize himself in midair. He
gave Ning a cold glare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to act
against me, do your best,” Ning said. “If you can invite any
experts to come help you, I, Ji Ning, will be here waiting for you.”
Ning stared hard at him. “But when you come to deal with me,
prepare to suffer my reprisal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you a piece
of work.” Chen Jin gritted his teeth. Of course he wanted to kill
Ji Ning. But…he couldn’t!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was, after all, just
a disciple of the Chen clan with a bit of status; he wasn’t even
the heir who was in line to become the next clan leader! His father
was merely a Primal Daoist…even if an Immortal of his clan was
somehow willing to give him face and help him, how could that
Immortal possibly go kill the disciple of Immortal Diancai, a
monstrously talented genius of the Black-White College?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of its own
survival, a clan would definitely not act in rash, violent, dangerous
ways. A clan which did act in such a way wouldn’t be able to
survive for too long!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Holyfire flew to his side. Chen Jin glanced at Holyfire. Although his
heart still blazed with rage, there was nothing he could do. All he
could do was nod. “Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Chen
Jin, before leaving, gave Ning a final glance, then said in a low
voice, “Let me offer you a word of advice. Ninelotus is the next
leader of the Dongyan clan; this has already been set in stone. The
Dongyan clan is an ancient clan that is even more powerful than our
Black-White College. Not just anyone can become the Dao-Companion to
the next leader of a clan like this. Even I, in terms of background
alone, don’t quite match up; that’s why I still have to
frantically train. As for you? Hmph…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry
yourself about that,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin and Holyfire
once more mounted that fiery red cloud, transforming into a streak of
light and disappearing into the distant horizons. The only figures
now left in the skies of Serpentwing Lake were Ning and Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
NInelotus stood there, a look of guilt on her face. “It’s all my
fault…I’ve caused you to gain another enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the way of
human interactions in the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, Ji Ning
and Chen Jin were fellow disciples of the same school who had never
met. In the blink of an eye, however, Ji Ning had become a fiend in
Chen Jin’s heart, casting a shadow over it! Similarly, because Chen
Jin had threatened to annihilate the Ji clan, Ning now viewed him as
his hated enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t your
fault, senior apprentice-sister,” Ning said with a laugh. “Don’t
worry. Chen Jin is nothing more than a dancing clown. He might be
able to hop around smugly for a time…but what of it? What can he do
to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was one of the two
Sword Immortals of the entire Black-White College! The other,
naturally, was his own master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Earlier, you
demonstrated the third stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], the ‘Sudden
Sword Light’,” Ninelotus said softly. “If the Black-White
College was to learn of this, the degree of importance they view you
with would skyrocket even more. The [Three-Foot Sword] is the most
powerful sword art of the Black-White College, and you are a genius
of the Dao of the Sword; the Black-White College will definitely
spare no expense in training you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Chen clan is
comparable to the Black-White College, but it’s in the Highwater
Commandery; the amount of influence it has in Stillwater Commandery
is quite low. In addition, Chen Jin’s status in the Chen clan is
fairly ordinary…and so you truly don’t have much to worry about.”
Ning nodded as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
chatting in midair, and standing very close to each other. When
Ninelotus spoke, Ning could almost feel her breath. This caused Ning,
who had never before had a relationship with a woman, to suddenly
have an impetuous feeling…which was only strengthened by the fact
that just now, he had defeated his ‘rival in love’, Chen Jin.
Ning suddenly stretched his hand out, grasping Ninelotus’ hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’ hand was
very soft, as though it were made out of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ninelotus was
somewhat caught off guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be my
Dao-Companion,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment,
Ninelotus’ mind was thrown into a state of chaos. She had actually
been hesitating this entire time; during the past year, she had
slowly grown more certain of herself, but she was, by nature, a
cautious person. She had been planning to wait and watch for a few
more years, but in the face of Ning’s sudden ‘attack’…she
didn’t know what to say or do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation is one filled with pitfalls and traps. But we would at
least have a Dao-Companion as we traverse this path.” Ning looked
at Ninelotus. “Senior apprentice-sister, are you willing to
accompany me in traversing this path of Immortal cultivation for a
thousand years…for ten thousand years…and for eternity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’ eyes
suddenly turned red. She nodded gently. “Hahaha….” Ning began
to laugh joyfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember what you
said,” Ninelotus said, looking at Ning. “We shall walk this path
of Immortal cultivation together. A thousand years…ten thousand
years…an eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Autumn Leaf, who
was watching this scene from the distant Brightheart Island, she
revealed a hint of a smile as well. “The young master…has finally
found his love.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
of Stillwater City. Adept Flowcloud, also known as Chen Jin, had
returned to his own estate. He sat there by himself, drinking one cup
of wine after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin muttered this
name repeatedly, a terrifying look in his eyes. The woman he had
loved had been taken from him, and he had first been defeated, then
been choked and forced to swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.
All of these things caused Chen Jin to feel a boundless amount of
hatred towards Ning, but…there was nothing he could do. Ning had
been training for far fewer years than him, but Ning’s rate of
advancement caused even Chen Jin to feel tongue-tied and speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be able to
catch up to him. I won’t be a match for him.” Chen Jin couldn’t
even rouse himself to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Agony filled Chen Jin’s
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” Chen Jin’s
eyes suddenly let up. “Although Ninelotus won’t be mine, Ji
Ning’s clan is far inferior to mine. Although he is a monstrously
talented person…to an ancient, massive clan such as the Dongyan
clan, they won’t care about that at all. Right…I imagine that the
Dongyan clan doesn’t know about Ninelotus and Ji Ning yet.
Then…I’ll give Ji Ning ‘a hand’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Dongyan
clan learns of this, they will definitely prevent the two from being
together. Definitely!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin was a disciple
of a major clan as well; he knew very well how major clans carried
out their affairs. Everything was done for the sake of the clan! The
same was true for the leader of the clan as well. Only someone whose
status in the clan was like Ji Ning’s status to the Ji clan, whose
personal status and influence completely eclipsed the entire clan
itself, was able to surpass the importance of the clan. In those
cases, the entire clan would move according to the wishes of that
person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ninelotus, by
herself, couldn’t possibly surpass the entirety of the Dongyan clan
in importance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this.”
Swoosh. Chen Jin transformed into a streak of light, once more
departing from the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dongyan clan was an
extremely mighty clan; since it stretched over three commanderies, it
naturally had a local branch in Stillwater City. That very day, Chen
Jin spread news of Ninelotus and Ji Ning to this branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primal Daoist in
charge of running this branch didn’t dare to be negligent at all in
handling this affair; this news, after all, involved their next
leader, ‘Ninelotus’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very soon…the news
made its way back to the primary headquarters of the Dongyan clan in
Highwater Commandery, in the Dongyan Mountains. This was a mountain
range that spanned more than a hundred thousand kilometers, and which
was densely packed with countless structures and buildings. The
Dongyan clan’s population was calculated in the hundreds of
millions, and all of the clansmen lived here. In addition, this
mountain range was also filled with countless ancient formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was, after all, an
ancient clan that spanned three commanderies, one which had produced
multiple Celestial Immortals. But of course, too much time had
passed; although Celestial Immortals had infinite lifespans, they
might fall or die. No one knew for certain if the Dongyan clan still
had any living Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of their roots
and their foundation, the Dongyan clan definitely surpassed the eight
major powers of the Stillwater Commandery; they were actually close
to the Northmont clan in power! Perhaps the only major difference
between them and the Northmont clan was that they had never been
enfeoffed with a marquisdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun has
chosen a Dao-Companion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s her
Dao-Companion’s name?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This news instantly
caused a major upheaval amongst the high-ranking members of the
Dongyan clan.
</P>

Chapter 28 - Taken Away
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring Little Yun
back here!” An unfathomably old and reclusive patriarch of the
Dongyan clan gave the order personally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Forefather.”
A Loose Immortal, ‘Immortal Norshok’, responded with great
respect. That very day, he led a group of Loose Immortals in an
awe-inspiring display as they left the Dongyan Mountains of the
Highwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warm spring had
come, and the flowers had bloomed. A leaf-shaped boat was lazily
floating about on the surface of Serpentwing Lake. Atop the boat were
only two people; Ji Ning and Ninelotus. In the past, the two had
never made their feelings clear to each other, but upon both of them
acknowledging each other as Dao-Companions, upon acknowledging that
they would continue to accompany each other as companions for the
rest of their long life on the Immortal path…their hearts only grew
closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sat there,
facing each other atop the boat. In front of them was a table, and on
the table was some Immortal wine. This Immortal wine had naturally
been provided by Ninelotus. Ninelotus had an extraordinary
background, and the cups, wine, and various other items she carried
with her were all things which Ning had never seen before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of wine is
this?” Ning held an exquisite jade wine cup in his hand, lightly
tasting the wine. Instantly, his entire body became filled with a
pleasurable feeling, while his heartrate began to quicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is known as
‘Immortal Dong’s Wine’.” Ninelotus held a cup of her own.
“This wine actually has quite a history to it. In another one of
the major worlds, one which is comparable in size and scope to this
world of ours which is under the control of the Grand Xia Dynasty, an
Immortal maiden from the Heaven Realm descended upon it. By a chance
encounter, she met with an ordinary Immortal cultivator of that
world, ‘Dong You’…the two entered into a secret relationship,
wishing to accompany each other forever. Unfortunately, that Immortal
maiden had an extremely exalted status in the Heaven Realm; the
elders behind her would absolutely not permit her, an exalted
Celestial Immortal, to become Dao-Companions with an ordinary
Immortal cultivator. Thus, they forced them apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately let
out a moved sigh. An Immortal maiden of the Heaven Realm? A
cultivator of the mortal realm?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, this
Dong You swore an oath that he would ascend to the Heaven Realm and
take back his Dao-Companion.” Ninelotus said softly, “A mortal
cultivator actually dared to claim he would go to the Heaven Realm
and take his Dao-Companion back…this was simply inconceivable. But
Dong You actually managed to overcome all of his difficulties,
conquer the Heavenly tribulation, and become a carefree, eternal
Celestial Immortal. He even became one of the leading figures of his
major world, and then…he led the many Immortals of his major world
to charge towards and attack the Heaven Realm. In the end…the
powers behind the Immortal maiden lowered their heads. He took her
back…and their legend became known throughout the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement. He had become a Celestial Immortal, then led a group of
Immortals from his major world to assault the Heavens themselves?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong You is also
known as Immortal Eastroam, and has become an awe-inspiringly famous
figure in the Three Realms. Even I, as a child, heard stories of
him.” Ninelotus sighed with emotion, “And this Immortal wine was
the wine concoted by Immortal Eastroam, Dong You. Many Immortals of
many major worlds love this wine, and my Dongyan clan managed to
acquire a bit. I carry three canteens of it with me, but have never
tasted it before.” After speaking, Ninelotus cast Ning a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was something she
left out; the reason she had never tasted it was because she had
always planned to one day enjoy it with her own Dao-Companion. This
Immortal Dong’s Wine was a sort of testament to fidelity in love,
and so maidens of the royal Xia clan, the Dongyan clan, and other
supreme clans liked to collect this wine and enjoy it with their
Dao-Companions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in turn,
understood what Ninelotus was thinking. He took another small sip of
this Immortal wine. The rousing feeling in his heart brought by the
wine did indeed feel similar to the feeling one might have upon
seeing one’s beloved woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned, raising his head. Ninelotus did the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the formerly
completely empty sky, an enormous, completely black warship had
appeared. The warship was extremely wide, and it was covered with
fluttering flags with two characters atop it; ‘Dong’ and ‘Yan’.
The warship emanated an aura of might, as though it were capable of
battling the heavens and the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rows of armored
Dao-soldiers stood atop the desk of the warship, and the eyes of
these Immortal cultivators were both cold and dominating. Each of
them was at least at the Wanxiang Adept level, and they were trained
to a high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waves of wind crushed
outward from the warship as it soared towards Serpentwing Lake. The
invisible ripples of wind caused the surface of the distant
Serpentwing Lake to generate massive waves, and the little boat Ning
and Ninelotus were seated on were lifted up as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” Ning
immediately collected the little boat. He and Ninelotus stood on the
surface of Serpentwing Lake. The lakewater around them immediately
grew calm. Although awe-inspiringly massive waves crashed down
nearby, the area immediately next to them was completely calm and
placid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning sent to the nearby Ninelotus, “Senior apprentice-sister, this
is a warship of your Dongyan clan, but it seems they come with ill
intentions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be that the
clan has learned of our affairs. But…very few know about you and
me. Luo Qing knew more than a year ago; if she notified the clan, the
clan would’ve come long ago…for them to only come today means
that it was most likely Chen Jin who told them.” A hint of worry
appeared on Ninelotus’ face. “The day I worried the most about
has finally come…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at
Ninelotus. “Senior apprentice-sister,” he said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the next
leader of the Dongyan clan. I refuse to believe that I won’t even
be permitted to decide upon my own Dao-Companion.” Ninelotus looked
at Ning. “Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, suddenly
felt an invisible pressure descend upon him. In this moment, he
finally, suddenly understood the meaning of Ninelotus preparing
Immortal Dong’s Wine for them. “So she was telling me to be
steadfast…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous warship
slowly descended, landing atop the surface of Serpentwing Lake. It
came to a halt directly in front of Ning and Ninelotus. In the face
of this massive, three thousand meter long warship, Ning and
Ninelotus seemed so small, so puny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An opening appeared at
the head of the warship, and a wide plank automatically descended,
landing on the surface of the lake. A man dressed in golden Daoist
robes walked out, and behind him were nine Primal Daoists whose auras
filled the skies. Behind the nine were a group of armored Wanxiang
Adepts. This group of Immortal cultivators caused both the heavens
and the earth to shudder; a martial force like this would be able to
annihilate a sect like Snowdragon Mountain without any problems at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader is
Immortal Norshok of our Dongyan clan. Behind him are his nine Primal
Daoist disciples, and behind them is the Darkane Guard of our Dongyan
clan; all of them are at the Wanxiang Adept level,” Ninelotus sent
to him. Right at this moment, she saw that Ning’s face had turned
rather white. “Ji Ning, what’s wrong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine,” Ning
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surges of terrifyingly
powerful divine will were crashing against his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Norshok and
the nine Primal Daoists behind him had simultaneously launched divine
will attacks against him; even Ning felt it incredibly hard to endure
against an attack like this. His mind was focused on silently
visualizing the painting of Maiden Nuwa, and as it did, an image of
Maiden Nuwa appeared in his skull, emanating golden light and causing
Ning’s soul to grow calm and steady, allowing him to endure the
repeatedly clashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
golden-robed Immortal Norshok’s forehead creased slightly. He had
led such a large group over for the express purpose of shocking and
awing this kid from a backwater clan, and this divine will clash was
meant to teach him a long-lasting lesson. However, this young man
named Ji Ning, who was just barely twenty years of age, had actually
been able to withstand the divine will attacks of himself and his
nine mighty disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this Ji
Ning’s soul is quite powerful…can it be that he’s a
reincarnated Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if he is a
reincarnated Immortal, of what use is he to our Dongyan clan?”
Immortal Noshok sent a calm message back mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Black-White
College had quite a few reincarnated Immortals within it. What were
reincarnated Immortals? They were individuals who, at the Earth
Immortal or Loose Immortal stage, had despaired of making any further
advancements and thus had chosen to reincarnate! After reincarnating,
although it would be fairly easy for them to once more train to
become Earth Immortals…if they didn’t succeed in becoming
Celestial Immortals in their past life, it was very possible that
they also wouldn’t be successful in this life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After withstanding the
divine will clash and sending the enemy divine wills off, Ning
understood that these people had definitely come with ill intentions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun.”
Immortal Norshok didn’t even look at Ning, just looking at
Ninelotus. “It’s time to go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t I only
supposed to go back after becoming a Primal Daoist?” Ninelotus
frowned. “Why must I go back so early? On whose authority?” Her
status in the clan was very high; even Immortals didn’t have the
authority to order her around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Forefather
personally gave the order for me to bring you back,” Immortal
Norshok said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Forefather?”
Ninelotus was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In some clans, on
occasion, an extremely powerful person would appear, whose status was
far more exalted than even that of the clan leader. Ning’s status
in the Ji clan was one such example! His status surpassed the
Patriarch’s; although he wasn’t the titular clan leader, he was
the true leader of the clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And for the Dongyan
clan…the Forefather of the Dongyan clan was the true leader of the
clan. He was an ancient presence that had existed for an unfathomably
long period of time; his lifespan was measured in hundreds of
millions of years. Anyone capable of living this long was, very
naturally, not a Loose Immortal! The high level members of the
Dongyan clan were all certain that the Forefather was a Celestial
Immortal, but the Forefather himself had never admitted to it or
publicized his status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true power was also
a mystery; however, those few times he did display it, those
so-called Loose Immortals were completely unable to even try and
resist his might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one in the clan
could go against his decrees. He was always in seclusion, and almost
never interfered in clan matters, but once he gave an order, everyone
would obey. Removing a clan leader from power, for the Forefather of
the Dongyan clan, took nothing more than a single sentence. From
this, one could see how exalted his status was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Forefather? I,
I…” Ninelotus gritted her teeth. One of the reasons why she had
been selected as the next clan leader was because of the Forefather;
the Forefather loved her and doted on her dearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go back with
you,” Ninelotus said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Norshok nodded
gently. He had never even thought about Ninelotus resisting; in the
Dongyan clan, there was no one who would dare to disobey the
Forefather’s orders! Unless, that is, they were truly about to
betray the clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus looked at the
nearby Ning. She sent mentally to him, “Wait for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Immortal Norshok urged. Ninelotus immediately walked towards Immortal
Norshok; those nine Primal Daoists and the Darkane Guard all
clustered around her, escorting her onto the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Norshok turned
his head, giving Ning a glance. He sent a direct mental message.
“Your name is Ji Ning? I think you had best wake up and understand
that Little Yun is not an ordinary disciple of an ordinary clan. If
she was an ordinary woman of the Dongyan clan, becoming
Dao-Companions with her would be fine, but she has been chosen to be
the next leader of our Dongyan clan. And you…you aren’t worthy of
her.” After speaking, he gave Ning a cold glance, then followed
Ninelotus into the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus looked down
from the warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked up from the
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes intersected
in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The air
around them began to roil about, then the enormous warship vanished
into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched Ninelotus
and the warship disappear. For a moment, he felt empty inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not worthy?” Ning
murmured these words to himself. The resolve in his eyes only grew
stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a green
leaf-type magic treasure flew over. Atop it was Autumn Leaf, the
Whitewater Hound, and Qingqing; they had seen these events occur from
far away, but due to the distance, they hadn’t been able to
overhear what had been said. Still, they clearly saw that Ninelotus
had been taken away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, are
you alright?” Autumn Leaf was extremely nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. The
elders of her clan miss her and want to see her, that’s all,”
Ning said.

Chapter 29 - The Forefather of the Dongyan Clan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Highwater Commandery.
The Dongyan Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the
headquarters of the Dongyan clan. Outsiders were completely forbidden
from entering. An enormous, awe-inspiring warship was in the azure
skies of the mountains, flying through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back.”
Ninelotus looked at the distant, familiar mountains. This was her
homeland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun, let’s
go. Go meet the Forefather,” Immortal Norshok said. Ninelotus
nodded obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, a cloud
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Immortal Norshok, controlling and
riding upon the cloud, took Ninelotus directly into the forbidden
lands of the Dongyan Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the Forefather
truly going to stop me?” Ninelotus mused silently to herself. Even
when she was a child, the Forefather had doted on her; in turn, she
absolutely worshipped the Forefather, and was extremely obedient
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to fly
forward through one forbidden region after another of the Dongyan
clan. The guards of these locations, upon seeing Immortal Norshok and
Ninelotus, did not move to stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a
period of time, they arrived at a secluded, ordinary-looking gorge.
Within the gorge, a small river was flowing, and by the sides of the
river, there was a man dressed in plain blue clothes. The man sat
there, fishing calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forefather.”
Immortal Norshok landed, then called out to him respect. Ninelotus
looked towards the blue-robed man, veneration in her eyes as she,
too, called out gently, “Forefather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Norshok, you can go
for now. Little Yun, stay with me.” The blue-robed continued to
fish, not even turning to look at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Immortal
Norshok respectfully departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the blue-robed man
and Ninelotus were left within the gorge. Ninelotus was very familiar
with this gorge, because she had spent her childhood here. Because of
the Forefather’s support…she had been selected as the next clan
leader without any disputes or struggles at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun.” The
blue-robed man turned to look at her, the faintest hint of a smile on
his face. It made him look very friendly and amiable. He sat there,
fishing, as though he were an ordinary commoner; he didn’t have the
aura of a cultivator at all. But in front of this man, the entire
Dongyan clan would be respectful and subservient, not daring to
offend him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forefather.”
Ninelotus instantly grew nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear you chose a
Dao-Companion,” the blue-robed man said with a laugh. “Named Ji
Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninelotus
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, you should
forget about him,” the blue-robe man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus grew frantic.
“Forefather, you chose me to be the next leader of the clan; can it
be that I can’t even choose a Dao-Companion for myself? I know that
our Dongyan clan needs to grow stronger, and that my choice for a
Dao-Companion would ideally be a member of the royal Xia clan or one
of the main lineage descendents of a marquisdom, but…even if I do
choose one of them to be my Dao-Companion, the benefit it would bring
to our Dongyan clan would be limited. Are you truly going to force
me, Forefather?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I would
force you?” The blue-robed man looked at her. Ninelotus was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if a prince of
the Grand Xia Empire became your Dao-Companion, he would only bring a
limited degree of benefit to our Dongyan clan. Would I really force
you over something like this?” The blue-robed man shook his head.
“Ninelotus, you truly are too young.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Forefather, you,
you told me to forget about junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning…”
Ninelotus was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man
suddenly asked, “Do you know what it means to be Dao-Companions?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus hesitated for
a moment. Dao-Companions?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companions…those
who will traverse the pitfalls of the Immortal path together for a
thousand years, for ten thousand years, for eternity; companions who
will never leave each other. Right?” Ninelotus responded softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man let
out a sigh. “Anyone can say the words. But Dao-Companions who truly
support each other and never leave or abandon each other…this is
incomparably rare. In my life, I have seen far too many
‘Dao-Companions’ betray each other, kill each other, abandon each
other…far, far too many. Nothing in this world is absolute.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was stunned
upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are too young.”
The blue-robed man shook his head. “That Ji Ning, he’s too young
as well. Are the two of you certain…that you truly understand what
it means to become Dao-Companions? Do you truly know what becoming
Dao-Companions means?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companions…this
means that you are willing to die for him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companions…this
means that if Immortals or Buddhas were to try and separate you, you
would slaughter Immortals and annihilate Buddhas in order to bring
your Dao-Companion back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companions…this
means that if he dies, even if an eternity passes, you would still be
unable to forget him; you would feel as though he was still alive and
right by your side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-Companions…your
other half in life! Without him, your life is no longer complete!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man
stared at Ninelotus, a look of unfathomable ancientness in his eyes.
“Are you certain…that you would be willing to die for him? Are
you certain…that for his sake, you would have the courage to
slaughter Immortals and annihilate Buddhas?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’s mouth
opened and closed a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Die for him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battle with all the
Immortals and the Buddhas of the heavens for him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are certain
of these things, if you feel no hesitation at all in answering this
question, then I won’t stop you. I would only support you.” The
blue-robed man sighed. “But I can see from your eyes that you are
hesitating, that you are pausing…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you aren’t able
to treat him as the other half of your life, if you aren’t able to
die for him, if you don’t have the courage to battle against all
the Immortals and Buddhas of heaven for him…then why must you
become Dao-Companions?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without that degree
of resolve, there’s no need for you to choose a Dao-Companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation…is a path which defies the heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can traverse it
alone. You can also traverse it with a Dao-Companion. This is an
incomparably difficult path, filled with pitfalls. Thus, if you are
to choose a Dao-Companion, you absolutely must choose a Dao-Companion
who will truly share life and death with him; one you would die for,
and one who would die for you. Otherwise…you would be better off
traversing this path alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man gave
Ninelotus a glance. “Ninelotus, what do you think?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Ninelotus
was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Had she been wrong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are too
young…and that Ji Ning is even younger than you. The two of you
haven’t experienced enough! You two are nowhere near close to the
point of selecting Dao-Companions, because your hearts are not yet
sufficiently resolved; the two of you simply feel a sort of
indistinct longing and affection for each other.” The blue-robed
man shook his head. “This sort of indistinct longing and
affection…it won’t last.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t forcibly
prevent you from being together with Ji Ning,” the blue-robed man
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, a
hint of delight instantly appeared in Ninelotus’ eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you must have
patience. When you become a Primal Daoist, if you still feel that Ji
Ning should be your Dao-Companion, than you can choose him. For now,
however…you will have to endure,” the blue-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait until I’m a
Primal Daoist?” Ninelotus was stunned. “How long is that going to
take?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve doted on you
too much. Your Dao-heart truly is quite ordinary. Go to the Myriad
Lotuses Cave. I’ll set down a formation; only when you can walk out
of the Myriad Lotuses Cave will you be permitted to leave the Dongyan
Mountains,” the blue-robed man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus said
frantically, “The Myriad Lotuses Cave? How am I suppose to break
through a formation that you set down, Forefather?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will just be a
bewildering formation meant to help illuminate your Dao-heart,” the
blue-robed man said, shaking his head. “No need to argue about it.
Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to send
someone to notify Ji Ning.” Ninelotus knew that refusal was not an
option, and so she hurriedly switched tacts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” the
blue-robed man said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus immediately
boarded a lotus-shaped magic treasure, immediately departing and
making arrangements for a notification to be given to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed man
watched Ninelotus leave, then gently shook his head. “She truly is
too young. Still…Ruyin, she truly does look just like you. How long
has it been…do you remember how the two of us fought,
shoulder-to-shoulder, in the ‘Skylight’ major world? That
battle…no matter how much time passes, I’ll never forget it.
Never…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, he quietly
went back to his fishing. His fishing hook attracted quite a number
of fish to come circling around it, but the ‘hook’ was straight.
It would never catch a fish.1

Chapter 30 - Nine Years in the Blink of an Eye
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above
Serpentwing Lake. A tall, willowy, silver-armored woman appeared,
standing atop a giant sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
silver-armored woman called out in a high voice. Swoosh! A wind
suddenly howled forth from Brightheart Lake, and then Ji Ning
appeared in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…?” Ji
Ning looked at the silver-armored woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mistress is your
‘senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus’. Per the orders from my
mistress, I have come to notify you of something,” the
silver-armored woman said. Ning, actually, had already guessed that
this woman had something to do with Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mistress said
that she needs to remain within her clan for a time and won’t be
able to come out in the near future. She asks you to wait for her
patiently.” The silver-armored woman said in a cold, clear voice,
“Mistress also said that the two of you could take this opportunity
to consider if the two of you were perhaps too rash in deciding to
become Dao-Companions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. Ninelotus
had gone back to her clan and would not return? And was asking him to
consider if they had decided to become Dao-Companions too rashly?
What was this supposed to mean?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve delivered my
message.” The silver-armored woman, after finishing, flew away on
her giant sword, quickly disappearing into the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to
Brightheart Island with a belly full of suspicions. Auutmn Leaf was
there by the beach, quietly waiting for him. “What happened, young
master?” Autumn Leaf, seeing the restless look on Ning’s face,
couldn’t help but ask him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus’ servant, just now,” Ning said with a
frown. “She came on orders to deliver a message. Ninelotus won’t
be able to leave the clan for a period of time, and also said that I
should calm down and think about if we were perhaps too hasty in
choosing to be Dao-Companions. What does this mean? Since we’ve
already chosen to become Dao-Companions, what’s this about it being
‘too hasty’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In both the previous
life and this one, Ning’s romantic history, or lack thereof, was
completely blank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master,”
Autumn Leaf said hurriedly, “I think these words don’t come from
senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus. She treats you with sincerity. I
imagine that the high-level members of the Dongyan clan instructed
this maidservant to speak those words, so as to make you nervous. If
you were to give up on your own, then they would have successfully
separated the two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Riiiight.” Ning’s
eyes lit up. “You are right. This is probably their scheme. The
Dongyan clan, in truth, doesn’t quite want to see myself with
Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf, seeing
Ning’s spirit rise, couldn’t help but laugh. So long as Ning was
happy, she was happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life went on without
Ninelotus for Ning. He continued to live at Serpentwing Lake. He had
concluded that the words sent by Ninelotus had come from the Dongyan
clan, which was seeking to cause trouble between them! Thus, Ning
didn’t question Ninelotus’ dedication at all. Rather, Ning felt
absolutely irritated with the Dongyan clan, and truly wanted to find
a chance to shock the contemptuous clan. This, Ning was quite
industrious in his training at Serpentwing lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he
would go into seclusion to practice his swordplay…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he
would go to the Raindragon Guard’s branch to take on some missions
to chase after and kill criminals or problem-causing Diremonsters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every two or three
years, he would make a trip into the underwater estate to meditate on
the Dao in the Stellar Hall…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And oftentimes, he
would just lie there on his boat, letting it drift about on the
surface of Serpentwing Lake. These moments were the calmest, most
peaceful moments for his soul…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
nearly nine years had passed. After having killed many powerful
criminals, Ning was now extremely famous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a new year.”
Ning stood there on his balcony, which was decorated with red
lanterns, illuminating the snow that continued to fall down in this
dark night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
dinner banquet is ready.” Autumn Leaf walked over. Ning looked
sideways towards Autumn Leaf. Although it had been nearly nine years,
Autumn Leaf’s appearance looked just as it had in the past. But
perhaps because of her innate talent, despite using the many
spirit-pills and medicines which Ning had provided, Autumn Leaf
remained at the peak of the Xiantian level, and was still yet to
establish her Zifu. The primary reason was her lack of comprehension
into the Dao, and so Ning would often provide her with personal
guidance. With his guidance, Autumn Leaf had begun to advance quite a
bit, and most likely in a few more years, she would finally step into
the Zifu level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bluestone, however,
is much less talented than Autumn Leaf,” Ning sighed to himself.
Bluestone was the little brother of Spring Grass, and Ning had once
sworn an oath in front of her grave to provide him with good
tutelage. Ning truly had gone all out in his efforts, and Bluestone
had managed to, just barely, reach the Xiantian level. However, his
rate of improvement in comprehending the Dao was far, far too slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone knew that
there wasn’t much hope for him, and so he instead asked Ning to
take him to Stillwater City. He had always lived at Serpentwing Lake,
and had very few life experiences; he wanted to see the legendary
Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, taking advantage
of a trip to accept a mission for the Raindragon Guard, delivered
Bluestone to Northmont Baiwei’s residence in Stillwater City,
asking Baiwei to help take care of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and Autumn Leaf were walking side-by-side in a corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
clan has sent another twelve youths over. Including that last time
five years ago, as well as that very first time…a total of twenty
eight youths have come,” Autumn Leaf said softly. “I feel that
the clan is going a bit too far. Young master, you need to spend time
on your own training as well. How can you possibly have enough time
to guide all of these youths?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “These
youths are quite weak. Your level of insight into the sword is fairly
high now; follow my instructions and go provide them with guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me?” Autumn Leaf
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate yourself,” Ning instructed. “When they break
through to the Xiantian level, bring them to see me. Come, let’s go
eat dinner together. Tonight will be the eve of the new year.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eve of the new year
was a day of great celebration. But within the Kou clan, one of the
six major hegemons of the Swallow Mountain Region, nobody was
laughing or smiling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The new clan leader of
the Kou clan, Kou Huai gently stroked the ancient stone walls in
front of him. He stared at each tile and each brick, at the
courtyards and the grass. “This is the homeland of our Kou clan…”
Kou Huai touched the walls and spoke in a hoarse voice, his eyes red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tears streamed down the
face of a maiden next to him. “Father, let’s go all out against
the Ji clan. This is our foundation, the foundation of our clan. They
are going to destroy our foundation, so let’s go all out against
them. At worst, both of us shall suffer injuries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you know?”
Kou Huai shook his head, then raised it, staring at the snow falling
from the skies. They felt very cold. “Go all out against the Ji
clan? With what? For now, let’s not discuss the most powerful
member of the Ji clan, Ji Ning; not a single clan in the Swallow
Mountain region is capable of blocking either of those two Wanxiang
Diremonsters under his command. Both of those Diremonsters are
Godbeasts, and are at the peak of the Wanxiang level! They are far
more powerful than ordinary peak Wanxiang Adepts. And Ji Ning
himself…he is the true face of terror.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
maiden gritted her teeth. “I will definitely make the Ji clan
regret this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about causing the Ji clan trouble.” Kou Huai shook hi shead. “Those
incomparably vile, wicked cultivators and Diremonsters in the
Stillwater Commandery region…quite a few of them were killed by
him. Amongst them was a particularly notorious and evil practitioner,
Adept Poisondove. Adept Poisondove was someone capable of fighting
against a Primal Daoist, then escaping with his life. And yet, he
ended up dying to Ji Ning. I imagine that soon afterwards, this Ji
Ning will become a Primal Daoist himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if a clan
with such power takes over the entire Swallow Mountain region? Our
Kou clan is so weak; if we don’t move, we’ll just be constantly
suppressed by the Ji clan. In the end, we’ll be wiped out. Moving
now, on the other hand, gives us a chance to survive and flourish in
another place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And in addition!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It can be said that
the Ji clan has already shown us mercy. They have not, at least,
embarked on a slaughter against us. They’ve allowed us to continue
to stay here.” Kou Huai let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had been
forced to hand over their official writs for their city to the Ji
clan, which was tantamount to surrendering their base, Kou Huai
didn’t feel hatred in his heart. This was because, after any clan
produced a supreme expert, they would rapidly consolidate control
over their surrounding territory. The Ji clan had Ji Ning, the
Whitewater Hound, and the Azure Skysnake; they had complete,
overwhelming power, and could’ve swept everyone away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan, however,
had not swept anyone away. Instead, they had ‘negotiated’,
allowing the various powers to voluntarily submit and decide to move.
The Ji clan even gave them some buffer time, allowing them at least
three but no more than ten years to depart from the Swallow Mountain
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow. Tomorrow,
we shall leave.” Kou Huai stroked the walls again. “Remember,
child. If you are weak, you will have to lower your head. There’s
no one else to blame but ourselves, for not being strong enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden nodded.
“Tomorrow, I will go to the Thousand Rivers Sect. Father, I will
definitely work hard to bring our Kou clan to prominence once more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Kou Huai
looked at his daughter, his eyes filled with expectations. His
daughter, his pride and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, compared to a
monster like Ji Ning, she was far inferior. If his daughter was
capable of becoming a Wanxiang Adept, most likely the entire Kou clan
would celebrate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eve of the new
year. The City of Ten Thousand Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire had already
retired; the current Patriarch of the Ji clan was the younger Ji
Truekeep!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kou clan and the
Blackfire Cult, in the next three days, will depart from their
commandery cities,” Truekeep said with a loud laugh. “Once they
leave, our Ji clan’s power will have expanded even more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were quite
obedient. They didn’t try to resist.” Ninefire smiled as he
spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The difference in
power was too great. They had no desire to fight back at all.”
Granny Shadow was very satisfied as well. “Truekeep, once the Kou
clan and the Blackfire Cult have left their commandery cities and our
Ji clan moves in, then in the Swallow Mountain region…the only
remaining powers will be the garrison of the Grand Xia Dynasty and
Snowdragon Mountain’s branch, right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep nodded. The
Grand Xia Dynasty’s garrison would definitely remain. As for the
Snowdragon Mountain branch? Although Dong Ziqi and the others had
died, Snowdragon Mountain had quickly sent more Zifu Disciples to
enter Swallow Mountain, causing the local branch to once more
flourish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Swallow Mountain
branch of Snowdragon Mountain has the main Snowdragon Mountain sect
behind them. Although they aren’t willing to offend our Ji clan,
they aren’t so afraid of us as to hand over their territory,”
Truekeep said with a sigh. “This will be troublesome. If we were to
truly act against the local branch of Snowdragon Mountain, I’m
worried that they will send some Wanxiang Adepts over from the main
sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain
didn’t wish to offend Ji Ning, whose potential was unlimited. But
they weren’t actually afraid of him! They didn’t expand their
territory in Swallow Mountain, but continued to stubbornly remain
within their previous territory. They wouldn’t launch any attacks,
but if the Ji clan were to dare to invade, they would show no mercy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as we
invade, the Swallow Mountain branch will immediately retaliate. The
leader of the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain, Daoist
Xu Ke, has said long ago that if our Ji clan were to dare to attack,
then they would dare to kill us.” Truekeep continued, “Although
during the past nine years, our Ji clan’s power in terms of our
Xiantian experts has swelled, it truly wouldn’t be worth it for us
to truly fight head on against Snowdragon Mountain. Their foundation
is much deeper than ours, and in terms of supreme experts, behind
them are Primal Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not rush to
fight them.” Ninefire shook his head. “I’ll go ask Ji Ning
about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The local branch of
Snowdragon Mountain was a tough bone to chew on. They were the final
obstacle preventing the Ji clan from completely dominating Swallow
Mountain.

Chapter 31 - Ji Ning’s Letter
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this was the
new year celebration; Ninefire and the others didn’t immediately go
disturb Ning. They waited until the sixteenth day of the month before
heading towards Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island. Within a study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing in
front of a desk, holding a writing brush and writing some characters.
Autumn Leaf, by his side, was helping him grind the ink.
Brush-calligraphy was something Ning had taken a liking to in recent
years, and it was also one of the ways in which Ning trained his
heart and also trained his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With every single
stroke of the brush, sword-light seemed to flash out in a dominating
manner. Ji Ning’s signature…it verily emanated an almighty
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-intent in
young master’s signature has become increasingly powerful.”
Autumn Leaf secretly sighed in amazement, “The young master
personally instructed me in all of my sword training, and I am at the
peak of the Xiantian level…but when I look at these words, I feel
my heart tremble, as though I’m completely powerless. In recent
years, his sword-intent has grown increasingly astonishing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody knew exactly how
powerful Ning had grown during these past nine years, but when Ning
had occasionally taken on missions for the Raindragon Guard and
revealed his power a few times, he had completely stunned all
onlookers. His most successful battle was definitely his execution of
Adept Poisondove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that evil cultivators whose bodies were surrounded by sin were
usually far stronger in battle than similarly ranked cultivators. In
turn, Daoist Poisondove was one of the most superb cultivators
amongst the ranks of evil cultivators. He was capable of successfully
escaping from the attacks of Primal Daoists…but he wasn’t able to
escape from Ji Ning! From this, the outside world was able to
guess…that Ning’s power must have truly reached a formidable
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, only Autumn
Leaf, who had the most direct access to Ning, was able to gain a
fairly accurate level of insight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-intent in
the young master’s calligraphy has only grown stronger and
stronger, at an astonishing rate. Compared to three years ago…it
seems to have changed in a qualitative way. There’s no point to
even comparing him to where he was nine years ago.” Autumn Leaf
secretly shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m done.” Ning
put down his brush, then said with a laugh, “Autumn Leaf, go ahead
and incinerate this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master,”
Autumn Leaf replied obediently. From the very beginning, Ning had
always instructed her to burn his writings. At first, Autumn Leaf had
been rather reluctant, and she had even said, “Young master, this
is such fine calligraphy…I can even feel the sword-intent surging
within the characters. If you were to leave this set of calligraphy
within the clan to allow the juniors to view it, it would be
wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had explained,
“I’ll be writing every day. After a few years, how many scrolls
will I have written on? In addition, these examples of calligraphy
are just casual writing samples; they have no keepsake value. Every
year, I’ll leave behind one special set of calligraphy, to be
stored within the clan. As for the others, burn them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning gave these
instructions, Autumn Leaf no longer argued with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, young
master.” A voice suddenly rang out from outside. Ning raised his
head to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf also walked
out, then asked, “What is it?” The messenger maidservant called
out hurriedly, “The Patriarch and the others came. They are waiting
in the guest hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Truekeep?”
Laughing, Ning instructed, “Then I’ll come right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me tidy these
things.” Ning glanced at Autumn Leaf, who nodded. Autumn Leaf would
generally be the one to personally take care of and store Ning’s
personal belongings; other maids and servants were forbidden from
touching them. In particular, Ning’s calligraphy with
sword-intent…mere Houtian warriors might literally be frightened to
death by the sword-intent emanating from them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even normal Xiantian
lifeforms would be terrified to the point of paralysis. Autumn Leaf
trained under Ning and had an exceedingly high level of expertise in
swordplay, and yet…usually, even she felt her heart quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the guest hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, dressed in furs,
smiled as he walked in. Upon seeing Truekeep, Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and Ah Xing in the living room, he couldn’t help but say
with an astonished laugh, “I thought it was just Uncle Truekeep. I
didn’t imagine that the Elder Patriarch and the rest of you came as
well. For all four of you to come…this must be about something
major.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it indeed,”
Truekeep nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak, what is it?”
Ning sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and Truekeep
exchanged a glance, then nodded slightly. Truekeep said, “Ji Ning,
you know that with your help, our Ji clan’s power has grown
explosively. Naturally, we’ve begun to expand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Any clan,
upon growing powerful, would expand! He had gone to the local branch
of the Raindragon Guard and traded for some techniques, which he was
permitted to transfer to his clan. It must be understood that some Ki
Refining techniques were possessed by virtually all large clans, and
thus the Raindragon Guard would permit these techniques to be passed
down to a Guard’s clan. However, the price in karmic merit points
would be much higher. The reason Ning had repeatedly gone to take
missions was precisely due to this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from techniques,
Ning had also acquired liquefied elemental essences, spirit-pills,
and various other things. With those things and his tutelage, the Ji
clan’s ranks of Zifu Disciples had swollen to more than ten. Three
of them had left Swallow Mountain, and had joined various sects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kou clan, the
Riverbank clan, and the other clans have been friends with our Ji
clan for many years,” Truekeep said with a sigh. “However, this
matter involves the strength and success of our clan; our Ji clan
doesn’t need to be too merciful. That’s why we asked them to
voluntarily migrate out of Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He knew
about these matters and wasn’t surprised by them. The Dongyan clan,
for example, took up a mountain range of hundreds of thousands of
square kilometers, comparable to more than a hundred Swallow
Mountains! Snowdragon Mountain, in turn, had also taken up an
extremely large territory as their headquarters! But of course, the
Black-White College focused on a small group of elites, and so didn’t
need a large territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the
Black-White College was a school; it could recruit elites from the
outside world. Major tribes and clans, however, felt more trust
towards their own descendants. In order for the tribe to flourish,
there was naturally a need for increasingly large amounts of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Currently, in the
Swallow Mountain region, only that branch of Snowdragon Mountain has
refused to leave,” Truekeep said. “The other powers have all
left. As for Snowdragon Mountain, they have the main sect behind him;
clearly, they are prepared to do battle at a moment’s notice. If
our Ji clan dares to invade, then they will dare to attack. Our Ji
clan has accumulated quite a bit of power in recent years, but
reinforcements arrive from the main Snowdragon Mountain sect in an
unending stream. If we truly were to fight them…the Ji clan would
find it quite difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood.
Frowning, he said, “This local branch…are they truly so
impertinent as to not know when their time is up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve correctly
calculated that our Ji clan doesn’t dare fight with them head on, I
imagine. They event sent me an envoy, saying that they won’t expand
their territory, but that they also wouldn’t leave. Their attitude
was quite resolute.” Truekeep gritted his teeth. “Hmph. Come to
think of it, when our Ji clan was weak, Dong Ziqi led the Swallow
Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain to try and force our Ji clan
to leave, threatening us with annihilation. Now, however, they see
that you, Ji Ning, are not an easy person to deal with…and so they
say they won’t expand? It isn’t that they won’t expand, it is
that they don’t have the strength to!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For someone who was
weak to say they wouldn’t expand their territory was nothing more
than empty self-praise. When the Swallow Mountain branch of
Snowdragon Mountain had been powerful, hadn’t they been constantly,
slowly expanding their territory? They had been an outside force that
had shoved their way into Swallow Mountain, becoming the most
powerful local organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, what do you
think our Ji clan should do in response?” Truekeep looked towards
Ning. “Our decision today will impact the entire clan. We can’t
be the slightest bit negligent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Swallow Mountain
branch of Snowdragon Mountain truly doesn’t know its limits. A puny
little branch…dares to act like this?” Ji Ning frowned, then
said, “I’ll send a letter. Uncle Truekeep, send someone to
deliver it to the Snowdragon Mountain branch. However, after the
letter is rolled up, it absolutely must not be opened. I’ll set a
restrictive spell over it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Truekeep
nodded. Ning immediately took out leather parchment and began to
write a letter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, Truekeep, and the old servant Ah Xing watched from the side.
When they saw what Ning wrote, their faces couldn’t help but
change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is…is this
perhaps, going a bit far?” Ninefire said, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Ning said calmly. “Snowdragon Mountain does not concern me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine years. Ning knew
exactly how powerful he had grown in these nine years. In just three
years after joining the Black-White College, he had mastered the
first two stances of the [Three-Foot Sword]. Nine more years had
passed, and in the underwater estate…Ning had successfully
challenged and overcome the fourth level of the Wargod Hall,
acquiring yet another magic treasure. Ning’s power, compared to
nine years ago, was unfathomably greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge into
Snowdragon Mountain? That’s their headquarters; I can’t imagine
how many secrets and spells they have hidden in that place. Even
Immortals would be wary of charging in; my power isn’t enough for
now. But outside Snowdragon Mountain…without the support of the
spells and formations located in the mountain, those Primal Daoists
of Snowdragon Mountain are not enough to cause me concern,” Ning
mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain had
powerful backers, yes; its backer was the Northmont clan of
Stillwater Commandery! Generally speaking, all of the major powers
within Stillwater Commandery would ally themselves with the Northmont
clan of Stillwater, or with the Raindragon Guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning, in turn, had
backers of his own! In fact, his relationship with the Northmont clan
of Stillwater Commandery was even closer than Snowdragon
Mountain’s…and he also had his master, Immortal Diancai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
Snowdragon City of Swallow Mountain. This was the only commandery
city which the local branch now controlled. As for the other two…the
Ji clan had acquired both official writs when Dong Ziqi and the
others had died. Now that the Ji clan was so strong, they were easily
able to take over those two cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon City,
however, was like a nail, sticking up in the wilderness, firmly fixed
into the Swallow Mountain region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A messenger from the
Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, this puny Ji
clan…they only relied on that Ji Ning in order to grow strong. How
old is Ji Ning? Although his potential is astonishing, it’s quite
possible that he might die on his Immortal path one day. I don’t
even know how many so-called ‘geniuses’ died in such a manner,”
a silver-haired elder said, an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His name was ‘Xu
Fang’; he was the custodian of Snowdragon City. The Swallow
Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain, in turn, was under the
control of Xu Ke. The ‘Xu’ clan was a fairly powerful clan which
belonged to Snowdragon Mountain; it had quite a few Wanxiang Adepts.
However, Adept Xu Li had died in that battle. This had enraged the Xu
clan, and when Snowdragon Mountain’s main sect had begun to make
preparations for sending reinforcements to Snowdragon Mountain, the
Xu clan had volunteered its services bravely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ji Ning’s
rate of improvement had been simply too shocking. The true leader of
the Xu clan, Adept Xu Ke, had been so terrified that he had fled back
to the main sect, leaving behind the Zifu Disciple, ‘Xu Fang’, to
control matters here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, for Ji Ning,
killing a Wanxiang Adept was as easy as killing a chicken. Naturally,
Adept Xu Ke didn’t dare take the risk of being present. Xu Fang
would only send a message to the main sect and Adept Xu for major
matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu Fang, this is the
letter my young master has written to you.” A tall, muscular old
man spoke out in a cold voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were in the main
hall. Xu Fang was seated on his throne, while next to him was three
Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your young master?”
Xu Fang couldn’t be bothered to rebuke this man for his lack of
courtesy; he was badly frightened by the two words, ‘young master’.
The ‘young master’ who was writing to him…was the legendary Ji
Ning of Serpentwing Lake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Zifu
Disciples within the hall were all petrified as well. They could be
disdainful in front of Ji Truekeep and the others, but as for the
legendary Ji Ning of Serpentwing Lake…they felt terror from the
bottom of their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Catch.” The elder
of the Ji clan tossed the scroll over towards them. Xu Fang caught
it, and the three Zifu Disciples next to him moved towards him as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He unfurled the scroll.
As he did, the first thing they noticed was the sword-intent which
flooded towards them from the characters atop it. It caused their
hearts to tremble and their legs to turn weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu clan, of the
Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain. I give you ten days
to get the f*ck out of Swallow Mountain. If after ten days you have
yet to move, then don’t blame me for showing no mercy with my
sword.” It was quite a casual letter, but it was filled with an
absolutely dominating aura! Normally, the Ji clan and the Snowdragon
Mountain branch would tussle back and forth, but they would never get
into a real fight. Ji Ning’s letter, however, showed no sign of
compromise at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to leave in
ten days. Otherwise…he would attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…” Xu
Fang stared, then said with fury, “This shows no respect for our
Snowdragon Mountain at all. Quick, report this to the main sect!
Report this to the main sect!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The restrictive
spells on the parchment, summoning natural fire, instantly caused the
parchment to begin to blaze, transforming it into gray ash.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 32 - Daoist Snowplume
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They aren’t even
leaving the words behind?” Xu Fang, of the Swallow Mountain branch
of Snowdragon Mountain, and the other three Zifu Disciples were so
furious that they gritted their teeth. When they looked at the
characters on the leather parchment, they had sensed the sword-intent
surge towards them, and had been so frightened that their legs had
turned soft. They understood that they were at too low of a level,
and that they were unable to comprehend the level of insight the
sword-intent within the characters indicated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if the
high-level members of Snowdragon Mountain were to see the parchment,
they should be capable of deducing Ji Ning’s level of strength.
Clearly, Ji Ning was extremely cautious and didn’t plan on giving
them that chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master’s
letter has been delivered. I won’t tarry!” The envoy of the Ji
clan turned, openly and unabashedly walking away. As for Xu Fang and
the other members of Snowdragon Moutain, they could only watch as the
envoy walked away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning of
Serpentwing Lake has made his threat. What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They looked at each
other, their gazes filled with fear and unease. Upon seeing the
characters on the scroll, they immediately knew…that Ji Ning’s
power had reached a level that was vastly beyond their’s. He was
most likely capable of annihilating them with one blow. This massive
gap in power which they faced made them feel tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…this
person isn’t someone the likes of us can deal with. Ji Ning of
Serpentwing Lake…he is someone who is able to effortlessly kill
Wanxiang Adepts. We have to report this to the main sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We must
report this to the main sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third Brother, we
are simply too far from the main Snowdragon Mountain sect. In ten
short days…we won’t even be able to make it back to the sect.
There’s no way to report this at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Fang and the other
three exchanged glances, their eyes filled with helplessness and
bitterness. Right. Ji Ning had only given them ten days, but they
were only Zifu Disciples; they wouldn’t be able to make it back to
Snowdragon Mountain in just ten days. They wouldn’t be able to
alert the main sect of the letter and the threat which Ji Ning had
made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no other
options. I’ll have to use the talisman,” Xu Fang said, shaking
his head. “Although there’s no way to let the main sect know of
the details, at least we’ll be able to let them know that something
happened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Break the
talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s our only
choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All four men were in
accord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of the
Swallow Mountain branch was Adept Xu Ke, but because Adept Xu Ke was
terrified of Ji Ning, he had hidden himself within the main sect.
Before leaving, he had left three talismans, then gave these
instructions: “These three talismans are different in size. When
you break then, I’ll be able to sense it. If you break the smallest
talisman…that means that the Ji clan’s attack is imminent! If you
break the middle one, that means Ji Ning’s attack is imminent! And
if you break the largest one, that means that the local branch has
already been shattered. Remember - only when a true emergency occurs
are you to break these talismans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three talismans
represented three different danger levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An attack from the Ji
clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This meant that the
situation wasn’t that bad; after all, in terms of their relative
power bases, the local branch of Snowdragon Mountain truly wasn’t
afraid of the Ji clan. But if Ji Ning were to attack…then things
really would turn grim. There was no way the Swallow Mountain branch
could possibly resist the monster-like ‘Ji Ning of Serpentwing
Lake’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Fang waved his hand,
and three talismans of different sizes appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is going to
personally attack…there is nothing we can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to hope that
the main sect will send experts to come negotiate with Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their hearts, they
didn’t believe that the main sect would truly choose to engage in a
battle with Ji Ning. After all, he was a disciple of the Black-White
College, and he had an Immortal behind him! Compared with the
Black-White College, Snowdragon Mountain was unfathomably weaker.
Although it was on good terms with the Northmont clan of Stillwater
Commandery, the Black-White College was actually located inside
Stillwater City, and its relationship with the Northmont clan was
incomparably close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be said that
the Northmont clan viewed the Black-White College as its hands and
arms, while Snowdragon Mountain was nothing more than a lackey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crack.” Xu Fang
shattered the second, pitch-black talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Snowdragon
Mountain. This was a place of unending winter, of eternal snow. Peaks
of various heights towered here, with Immortal cultivators living
with them. Within one such peak, the master was Adept Xu Zhen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Zhen had pale,
beardless face. He appeared quite handsome. He sat in the lotus
position on his jade bed. The white-robed Adept Xu Zhen’s eyes were
closed in relaxation, and he appeared quite rested. Next to him,
there were two young apprentices waiting on his instructions and his
needs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Adept Xu
Zhen’s face suddenly changed slightly. With a wave of his hand, he
produced a black talisman. This talisman had already shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This talisman had
originally come in a pair. If one was shattered, the other would
crumble as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This talisman is…”
Adept Xu Zhen thought back to what he had said, and then his face
changed. “This is the second talisman. It represents that Ji Ning
is going to act against the Swallow Mountain branch!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…he has
quietly slumbered for nine years. Is he finally going to attack?”
Adept Xu Zhen was rather panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Xu clan had
volunteered to be stationed within the Swallow Mountain region, they
had done so for two reasons. First, they had been angered by the fact
that Adept Xu Li had died there. Secondly, they wanted to expand the
territory of their own clan. But how could they have imagined that
soon after they had taken over, news would come…that Ji Ning had
joined the Black-White College?! This caused the Xu clan to be filled
with boundless regret. This assignment had become a hot potato that
they couldn’t discard, because…the prestige of Snowdragon
Mountain meant that the Xu clan was absolutely not permitted to
retreat or fold up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as time passed, Ji
Ning’s fame only grew greater and greater! Adept Xu Ke had been so
terrified that he had hidden himself back within the main sect,
leaving behind only those four Zifu Disciples. Even if the four of
them died, it wouldn’t represent too much of a loss for the Xu
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has finally
revealed himself. What should we do next? My Xu clan has multiple
Wanxiang Adepts, but I’m afraid that even if we join forces, we
won’t be able to overcome Ji Ning. He’s a monster that was
capable of killing even Adept Poisondove!” Adept Xu Ke frantically
pondered what to do next. “I have no other options…I’ll have to
go visit Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain had
a total of three Primal Daoists; they were Daoist Snowplume,Daoist
Coldsun, and Daoist Blackdragon. They each took up one of the three
highest mountain peaks in the region. The master of Adept Xu Ke, in
turn, was Daoist Snowplume.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a school of elites
like the Black-White College, the Primal Daoists of the second
generation disciples, when interacting with the Wanxiang Adepts and
Zifu Disciples of the third generation disciples, would be fairly
courteous. They wouldn’t act arrogantly or show off! However, in
schools with many disciples, where dragons swam alongside minnows,
the more powerful one was, the more high-and-mighty one would behave.
In the case of Snowdragon Mountain, to be one of only three Primal
Daoists meant that one really would put on a show of grandeur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xu Ke requests an audience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xu Ke requests an audience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, the junior
disciples guarding the gates to the mountain would make the
announcement. Next, one of the 99 male Zifu Disciples or 99 female
Zifu Disciples would go to report this to one of the Wanxiang Adepts
servants, who would then personally inform Daoist Snowplume.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, junior
apprentice-brother Xu Ke requests an audience,” a gray-robed man
said, standing respectfully outside a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granted.” A calm
voice came out from the private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This response was once
more passed out in multiple layers, and in the end, Adept Xu Ke was
finally allowed to come to the private room. Generally speaking,
Daoist Snowplume would only permit disciples which the school valued
greatly to remain by his side. For the likes of Adept Xu Ke, who had
no chance at all of breaking through to become Primal Daoists, they
had all been sent out long ago. They would only be permitted to make
an occasional visit if they had something important to discuss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple greets
you, Master.” Adept Xu Ke respectfully knelt outside the private
room. The outside area was covered in piles of snow. The white-robed
Adept Xu Ke, kneeling there within the pristine white snow, actually
made for quite a beautiful sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome Daoist,
dressed in a feathered robe, walked out. He had a head full of long,
unbound black hair, and a hint of amusement could be seen in his
long, slender eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was one of the three
titans of Snowdragon Mountain; Daoist Snowplume!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume’s
disciples all shared one commonality; they had to be handsome. He
himself was an extremely handsome man, and the same was true for his
disciples. The kneeling Xu Ke, the gray-robed man by the door…all
of them were exceptionally attractive in their looks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Daoist Snowplume said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respected master,”
Adept Xu Ke said, still kneeling, “Years ago, our Swallow Mountain
branch, because of the Ji clan, was nearly annihilated. At that time,
I went along with some of my fellow disciples and took up station
there, helping to steady and firm up that branch. However, by now, Ji
Ning’s level of power has reached unearthly levels. Relying on his
prestige, the Ji clan has shown us no consideration at all. This very
day, I received word that Ji Ning is about to attack our Swallow
Mountain branch in person! I truly am unable to do anything about
him, so I have come to request an audience with you, Master. I
beseech you, Master, tell me what I should do with regards to this Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Daoist
Snowplume frowned slightly. “He is going to personally attack? How
did you receive this news? We are quite far from Swallow Mountain; I
imagine that by now, our branch has already been destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It shouldn’t be,”
Adept Xu Ke said respectfully. “When I left Swallow Mountain, I
left behind three talismans to my clansmen. The destruction of
different talismans represented different types of news! The talisman
they destroyed…represented that Ji Ning would be attacking
personally! As soon as they destroyed it, I became aware of this
news, and so I immediately came to visit you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
nodded. “I have heard of the affairs between Ji Ning and the
Swallow Mountain branch. Ji Ning is perhaps too arrogant; our
Snowdragon Mountain has always been accommodating and unwilling to
create true enmity between our two sides, and we even chose to
pretend as though the death of Adept XuLi didn’t happen. After all,
in truth, that year, it was our Snowdragon Mountain which suffered a
loss, not their Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he views this as
being insufficient; he even wants to expel our entire Swallow
Mountain branch?” A hint of anger had appeared in Daoist
Snowplume’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could anyone
capable of becoming a Primal Daoist be a pushover?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph! No matter
what, he is merely a Wanxiang Adept; he’s not yet qualified to try
and force Snowdragon Mountain into avoiding him!” Daoist Snowplume
said coldly, “Let’s go. Accompany me to Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Ke and the
gray-robed man were both greatly shocked. The master was going to go
in person? They had originally assumed that an envoy would be sent to
negotiate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is a mere
Wanxiang Adept,” Adept Snowplume said coldly. Snowplume was a
cultivator who had trained for more than a thousand years, and was
now at the peak of the Primal stage! Although some truly monstrous
Wanxiang Adepts were capable of giving Primal Daoists a good fight,
there were differences between early, middle, late, and peak-stage
Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he possibly
fear Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College has a large number of Wanxiang Adepts; the most monstrous of
them are the truly genius disciples such as Holyfire. Every few
centuries, they will produce another ‘genius’, but in the end,
the Black-White College still only has a few Immortals.” Daoist
Snowplume mused to himself that becoming an Immortal was no easy
feat! “Even if Ji Ning is a monster, it will still be hard for him
to become an Immortal! And even if he does become an Immortal…he
will still be under the control of the Marquis of Stillwater. What
can he do to us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
take a look at this Ji Ning and see how much of a ‘genius’ he is
and how much of a ‘monster’ he is, for him to show such disregard
for our Snowdragon Mountain,” Daoist Snowplume said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Adept Xu Ke
and the other all immediately bowed in acknowledgment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shortly afterwards, a
large warship, under their control, began to soar through the skies,
departing from Snowdragon Mountain.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Swallow

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient Immortal
vessel, emanating a powerful, crushing aura, was surging towards
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our repsects to you,
Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Fang and the other
Zifu Disciples knelt down, extremely nervous. They didn’t even dare
to raise their heads to look at him. To the four Zifu Disciples…the
Primal Daoist level was unfathomably distant from them. In addition,
they hadn’t imagined that after shattering that talisman, one of
the three Patriarchs of Snowdragon Mountain, Daoist Snowplume, would
be the one to come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Describe the
situation to me in detail.” The feather-robed Daoist Snowplume sat
there. He gave them a sideways glance, then closed his eyes and
calmly gave them their orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The leader,
Xu Fang, cleared his throat, then said nervously, “Just yesterday,
an envoy from the Ji clan came to our Snowdragon City and tossed a
scroll written by Ji Ning for us to read. When we saw the scroll…we
were immediately frightened by the terrifying sword-intent contained
within those characters, to the point of our legs going soft and our
hearts quivering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were so
frightened that your hearts quivered and legs went soft?” Daoist
Snowplume suddenly opened his eyes wide as he stared at the kneeling
Xu Fang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Patriarch,
you can ask the other three,” Xu Fang said hurriedly. The other
three kneeling Zifu Disciples all hurriedly nodded as well. “It is
true. We were so frightened that our hearts shook and our legs went
weak. The characters on that scroll did truly contain a terrifying
sword-intent. We’ve never seen such a terrifying sword-intent
before…those characters completely chilled our hearts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We wouldn’t dare
to live. This sort of sword-intent…we’ve never even heard of it
before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was the letter
written personally by Ji Ning of Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them hurriedly
responded in unison. This caused Daoist Snowplume to frown and bark,
“Give me that letter and let me look at it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Fang immediately
said, “That scroll was covered by a restrictive spell. When we
opened it and read it, it automatically self-destructed and was set
aflame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume’s
face instantly turned rather unsightly. This caused Xu Fang and the
other three to be utterly terrified at the thought that they might
have angered their Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did his letter
say?” Daoist Snowplume barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His letter just had
a simple line of words. It said this: Xu clan, of the Swallow
Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain. I give you ten days to get
the f*ck out of Swallow Mountain. If after ten days you have yet to
move, then don’t blame me for showing no mercy with my sword<FONT FACE="Cambria">。“
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Fang was a
cultivator; naturally, his memory was extremely good, and he had
completely memorized the words which Ji Ning had written.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume, upon
hearing this, immediately started to laugh. “He’s quite arrogant.
He truly does hold our Snowdragon Mountain with no regard at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you can
leave.” Daoist Snowplume waved his arm. Instantly, Xu Fang and the
other three quickly departed from the cabin, leaving behind only
Daoist Snowplume and his two disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Adept Xu
Ke and the gray-robed man both looked towards their master, waiting
for his response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sword-intent
within that scroll to terrify Zifu Disciples to the point of their
legs going soft…no one within Snowdragon Mountain has been able to
produce sword-intent on this level,” Daoist Snowplume said, nodding
gently. “I’ve heard that this Ji Ning specializes in using the
sword. Now, it seems, this truly is the case. However, no matter how
talented he is, he is merely a Wanxiang Adept, and the only magic
treasures he can use are top-grade Earth-ranked magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume felt
absolute confidence. Most of the so-called ‘Primal Daoists’ who
were defeated by Wanxiang Adepts were mere early-stage or
middle-stage Primal Daoists. He, however, was a peak-stage Primal
Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had trained for more
than a thousand years. As one of the three Patriarchs of his clan,
all the magic treasures he used were high quality Heaven-ranked magic
treasures. Everything else aside, his foundation of elemental energy
and his magic treasures completely surpassed Ji Ning’s. That was
without accounting for the ‘primal fire’ his body could produce,
or the ‘skywater’ he was cultivating, which was even more
formidable than dire-ice…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look at this so-called genius of the Dao of the Sword,” Daoist
Snowplume said with a calm laugh. “I truly am curious…what makes
him think he can abuse our Snowdragon Mountain so? Does he truly
think that his reputation as a disciple of the Black-White College is
enough to allow him to act in such a lawless manner?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart Island.
Serpentwing Lake. Within a study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was currently
doing what he did almost every day…writing calligraphy! Next to his
side, Autumn Leaf continued to grind ink for him. Ning, brush in
hand, wrote one character after another. To him, writing was a form
of enjoyment, a way to temper his heart and improve his understanding
of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surging, crushing
wave of divine will instantly swept across nearly the entirety of
Serpentwing Lake, including the entire Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Ning’s own
divine will, however, was like an unmoving boulder, and when the
crushing wave of divine will struck against it, the wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which fellow Daoist
is this?” Ning instantly sent through divine will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine sense? It
seems the outside world has underestimated you, Ji Ning. At such a
young age, you already possess divine sense…I imagine you are a
reincarnated Immortal.” The other surge of divine sense, having
realized that it held no advantage at all in terms of the soul, began
to chat with Ning. As for Ning, his own divine sense swept out as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Soulshaker Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A raging wave of divine
will smashed outwards, crashing towards the soul of Daoist Snowplume,
who was in the air above Serpentwing Lake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Daoist
Snowplume had trained for more than a thousand years, ten years ago,
Ning had already reached the Primal Daoist level in terms of the
soul. During the past ten-plus years, he had never slackened off
vigilantly training with the [Nuwa Painting]. His soul-improvement
had been tremendous, and his divine sense was now capable of
stretching to nearly a thousand kilometers. This made it so that even
the vast majority of Primal Doaists were unable to compete with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume, at
least, was somewhat weaker in terms of the soul. His divine sense was
only capable of stretching to six hundred kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf, tidy
things up here. I’ll go and take a look,” Ning said. Autumn Leaf
nodded and replied, “Yes, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an ancient,
enormous Immortal warship hanging in the air above Serpentwing Lake.
The Immortal cultivators aboard this ship included a feather-robed
Primal Daoist; it was Daoist Snowplume. At this moment, Daoist
Snowplume’s face changed slightly; clearly, he was feeling some
discomfort from Ning’s [Soulshaker Art] attack. However, since the
difference in soul strength between the two wasn’t that great, the
collision wasn’t able to affect him much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable Ji
Ning!” Daoist Snowplume, having suffered a slight loss in secret,
murmured softly to himself, “No wonder he is such a monster…so he
truly is a reincarnated Immortal! But so what if he is? It’ll be
even harder to withstand the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations,”
Daoist Snowplume smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every three centuries,
a tribulation would descend. Generally speaking, a mental trial would
accompany the tribulation, and the more one knew, the more terrifying
the mental trial would be. Reincarnated Immortals would have mental
trials that were far more powerful than the trials ordinary
cultivators would face. Thus, Immortals who chose to reincarnated
would initially advance at a breakneck pace, but the further they
went, the harder they would find it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In turn, there were few
to no reincarnated Immortals who would successfully pass the Heavenly
Tribulation to become Celestial Immortals. Their chance was actually
far lower than the chance which most Immortal cultivators faced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A reincarnated
Immortal?” Adept Xu Zhen and the gray-robed man looked at each
other, secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji clan truly
did blunder into tremendous luck; a reincarnated Immortal was
actually born into their clan,” Adept Xu Ke mused to himself. “That
junior apprentice-brother of mine, Xu Li…poor bastard…he died to
a reincarnated Immortal…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume said
calmly, “Don’t be frightened by that. So what if he is a
reincarnated Immortal? Many reincarnated Immortals fall and perish on
their Immortal path, even before becoming Immortals again. This is
all too common.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of the Sloppy
Daoist and Holyfire all had foundations for becoming Immortals!
However, the path of Immortal cultivation was a path which went
against the will of the heavens…and so the heavens would send
invisible trials and tribulations, causing the vast majority of these
geniuses to fall and perish. It was equally possible for reincarnated
Immortals to perish at the Wanxiang Adept or Primal Daoist levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you Daoist
Snowplume of Snowdragon Mountain? A distant voice rang out, a voice
which shook the world. Daoist Snowplume walked straight to the helm
of the ship, staring into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance,
there was a fur-clad youth. He looked like an ordinary youth from a
barbarian tribe, and behind him, there was an azure-robed maiden and
a large, snowy white dog. They all stood there in midair, staring
towards the ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, these people
from Snowdragon Mountain come with bad intentions,” the nearby
Little Qing sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course they do.
However, I didn’t expect that my intentions to drive out their
Swallow Mountain branch caused a Primal Daoist to come in person.”
Ning stared towards the distant warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume,
standing at the helm of the Immortal warship, truly did have the
elegant aura of an Immortal. He laughed loudly, “I am indeed. I
heard that the Black-White College has produced a disciple, Ji Ning,
whose talent is astonishing and whose power is formidable. Upon my
first time meeting you…I can tell that your reputation is
well-deserved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much,” Ning replied. “Might I ask why you have come to my
Serpentwing Lake, Daoist Snowplume?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume,
aboard his warship, spoke frankly. “I have come because of some
matters between you and the local branch of our Snowdragon Mountain.
Your Ji clan is expanding its territory here in Snowdragon
Mountain…our local branch won’t hinder you in the slightest, but
I heard that you sent word ordering the branch to move away within
ten days?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That did indeed
happen,” Ning said, nodding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you feel
that you are being a bit too arrogant?” Daoist Snowplume looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Based on what I know, your Snowdragon Mountain, in establishing
your headquarters, have taken over a territory of a hundred thousand
kilometers. You have also set up numerous branches throughout
Stillwater Commandery, and are constantly infiltrating into new areas
and continuing to expand your branches. Can it be that your own
Snowdragon Mountain is permitted to frantically expand, while my Ji
clan is to be so limited that we cannot even take over the Swallow
Mountain region?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who were powerful
would naturally expand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can your Ji clan
be compared in the same breath to my Snowdragon Mountain!” Daoist
Snowplume said with a frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, when
our Ji clan was weak, your Swallow Mountain branch dared to
constantly invade and push forward, becoming the most powerful force
within Swallow Mountain despite not being local to this place. You
even dared to try and forcibly take our elemental ore mine!” Ning
stared at Daoist Snowplume. “Now that our Ji clan is powerful, can
it be that we can’t even expel a single branch of yours? Can it be
that only you are allowed to abuse others, while our Ji clan isn’t
even allowed to expand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of anger was on
Daoist Snowplume’s face. “You truly are determined to exile our
Swallow Mountain branch?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are holding
Snowdragon Mountain in no regard at all!” Daoist Snowplume said
with anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think whatever you
wish. The expelling of the Swallow Mountain branch is something I
have set my mind on doing,” Ning said, staring at Daoist Snowplume.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes
intersected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
instantly understood that this Ji Ning was not going to lower his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think that
your reputation as a disciple of the Black-White College will scare
me off?” Daoist Snowplume’s face sank, and his voice began to
echo in the skies. “I urge you to know when to cut your losses.
Otherwise…today, I will personally teach you a lesson and let you
know…that the words you say need to be matched with an equal amount
of strength.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant Daoist Snowplume. He cracked his lips into a smile, and his
voice also echoed in the skies. “The words you say need to be
matched with an equal amount of strength…well-spoken! I was
actually hoping for you to provide me with some pointers, Daoist
Snowplume, and see what formidable techniques you have!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume was
instantly enraged. “You don’t know your limits,” he howled
angrily, his voice echoing out like a thunderclap from an enraged God
of Thunder. Instantly, the world around them began to change colors.
“I shall grant you your wish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come!” Ning’s
response was cold and calm.
</P>

Chapter 34 - Ji Ning Battles a Primal Daoist
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume soared
onto a cloud, then stood there in midair, staring towards the
opposite Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing, Uncle
White, the two of you, stay farther away,” Ning instructed. This
was a competition between himself and Daoist Snowplume; there was no
need for Uncle White or Little Qing to interfere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, be
careful,” the Whitewater Hound instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, beat the
crap out of that old Daoist!” Little Qing clenched her fists, full
of anticipation. Although she didn’t know exactly how strong Ning
was, she knew he was unfathomably stronger than he had been when they
had met in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume and Ji
Ning both stood there in the air, staring at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are actually
going to fight?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Ke and the
gray-robed man both watched with eyes filled with amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Lu, how can this Ji Ning be so bold as to dare to
fight against Master?” Adept Xu Ke had never, even in his wildest
dreams, imagined that Ji Ning would be this arrogant, not even giving
Daoist Snowplume any face. “Master is a peak Primal Daoist, and has
the full strength and support of our Snowdragon Mountain sect behind
him; even amongst Primal Daoists, he would be considered formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madman. A true
madman.” The gray-robed man shook his head, also in disbelief. “Can
it be that this Ji Ning thinks that he can defeat Master? Master
isn’t like some of those newly ascended Primal Daoists; he became a
Primal Daoist centuries ago! His foundation is unfathomably deep and
stable, and he has gained tremendous fame!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them, both
Wanxiang Adepts, were stunned. And as for the Zifu Disciples on the
ship? Their amazement went without saying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The large group of Zifu
Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain were completely shocked and dazed.
Ji Ning actually dared to challenged their unfathomably exalted
Patriarch, Daoist Snowplume? He was absolutely suicidal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shall grant you
your wish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume and Ji
Ning’s words, one after the other, thundered in the skies, filling
the air above the entire Brightheart Island. Quite a few denizens of
the island had already stood up to stare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is going to
fight a Primal Daoist?” Ji Ninefire’s face instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can Ji Ning act
so rashly? That’s a Primal Daoist! And a peak Primal Daoist, at
that…even if he wanted to fight one, he should choose an early or
mid-stage Primal Daoist to test himself against first. How can he
immediately challenge a peak Primal Daoist like Daoist Snowplume?”
Ji Truekeep was panicking as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, he even began
to feel regret. He began to regret asking for Ning’s advice as to
how they should deal with the local branch of Snowdragon Mountain. He
had no idea that Ning would be so ‘unyielding’, and be willing to
go head on against the enemy, even when they sent a Primal Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist
Snowplume…he’s a peak Primal Daoist!” Granny Shadow was
beginning to worry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan had always
been on poor terms with Snowdragon Mountain, which was why Ning had
acquired a set of detailed intelligence reports on Snowdragon
Mountain. After reading it, he had stored it within the Ji clan’s
archives. Naturally, Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the others had all
read through it and had gained an extremely clear understanding of
Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And this was exactly
why they were so worried right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master…”
Autumn Leaf chewed on her lips, holding her breath as she stared at
the two figures in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on both sides
felt that Ning was playing with fire…but Ning himself knew his own
level of power clearly. The reason why he dared to write such a
letter…was because he truly felt no fear towards Snowdragon
Mountain’s Primal Daoists!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power amongst Primal Daoists as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primal Daoists of
the Black-White College, for example, were absolute elites amongst
elites, who were even capable of giving Immortals a fight! Some of
the weaker, early-stage Primal Daoists, in turn, were far, far
weaker…even nine years ago, Ning was confident in being able to
escape with his life from them. It was precisely figures like Daoist
Snowplume who were the most suitable for Ning to test himself
against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you are a
reincarnated Immortal, I imagine that at your current level of power,
you haven’t completely awakened all of your former memories,”
Daoist Snowplume said, shaking his head and laughing. “I’ll let
you know…what the difference is between Primal Daoists and Wanxiang
Adepts!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fan suddenly appeared
within Daoist Snowplume’s hand. He gave it a casual wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fanning motion
instantly caused flames to appear out of nowhere. A brilliant golden
flame wildly rippled forth, exploding into a sea of flames that
swirled towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primal Fire?” Ning
instantly recognized it for what it was. Primal Fire was something
which every Primal Daoist possessed. During his adventure in the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains, the Dragonwhale, upon becoming a
Primal Daoist, had relied on this technique to burn Adept Redbud to
death. However, at that time, the Dragonwhale had only been an
early-stage Primal, and so the power of his Primal Fire wasn’t
strong enough. It was far weaker than Daoist Snowplume’s Primal
Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense.” Ning
let out a soft chant. Instantly, a lotus flower colored red and green
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The green came from the leaves of
the lotus flower, while the red came from the petals. The enormous
green leaves swirled around the red petals in the center, which were
clustered much more tightly together. They swiveled together
naturally, with Ning at the very center, completely protected by this
lotus flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his protective
technique, the Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flames formed from
Primal Fire seemed to cover the heavens. They surged towards Ning,
but the lotus simply continued to swivel in the middle of that sea of
flame. Clearly, the flames were completely unable to penetrate past
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daoist
Snowplume, fan in hand, revealed a look of shock on his face. “This
Ji Ning is able to easily deflect my Primal Fire, and without using a
sword technique, but some sort of protective technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, upon
learning that Ji Ning’s calligraphy had terrified the Zifu
Disciples so badly that their hearts had trembled and their legs had
gone soft, he had guessed that Ji Ning must be at an extremely high
level of expertise with the sword. He had thought that Ji Ning would
execute his swordplay, using it to strike against all techniques and
shatter the sea of Primal Fire. Daoist Snowplume was only intending
to use this ‘sea of Primal Fire’ to test Ning’s capabilities,
but he hadn’t expected that Ning would be able to block it with
just a single lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lotus flower? This
Ji Ning has an exceedingly deep level of comprehension of both fire
and water,” Daoist Snowplume mused secretly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, his words were
correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had indeed reached
an extremely high level of mastery in both the Dao of Rainwater and
the Dao of the Inferno. During the past nine years, he had been
supported by the underwater estate! His rate of improvement was
incomparably astonishing; his past nine years was comparable to
ninety years for an ordinary genius! In these two Daos, Ning already
felt in a vague way that he had reached a bottleneck. With but a
single further step, he would be able to completely comprehend the
Daos of Rainwater and the Inferno!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the added help he
had from Ninelotus in discussing the Dao and the secrets of the
lotus, Ning had further perfected this Waterflame technique. During
the past nine years, Ning’s dire-ice and earthfire had both reached
the fourth grade as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With dire-ice and
earth-fire assisting the Divine Solar Tattoo and Divine Lunar Tattoo
on his body in activating the natural fire and water of the world,
and with his comprehension of the Dao of Rainwater and the Dao of the
Inferno, and with his additional prowess in the mysteries of the
lotus…the current Waterflame Lotus had been formed, which was now a
supremely skillful protective technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The petals and the
leaves swiveled about each other in layers, possessing incomparable
defensive power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had exchanged
their first blows. One had unleashed a sea of Primal Fire, while the
other had created a lotus within the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the
spectators on both sides to feel incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s fine. Ji Ning
is fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is within
the lotus.” The Ji clan’s side let out sighs of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What technique did
this Ji Ning use? The Primal Fire which Master has been cultivating
for centuries isn’t able to do anything to him?” Snowdragon
Mountain began to grow nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you truly
do have a bit of talent,” Daoist Snowplume barked coldly. As his
words came out, the sea of fire that had filled the skies vanished.
“But I want to see how long you can hold on for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One drop of water after
another began to appear in the skies. These ‘raindrops’, however,
were the size of a fist, and there were 108 of them which hovered
around Daoist Snowplume’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywater?” Ning
revealed a look of curiosity and excitement on his face. Earthfire,
upon improving to the next level, would transform into skyfire;
dire-ice upon improving to the next level, would become skywater.
Even amongst Primal Daoists, only a few would have access to skyfire
and skywater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Daoist
Snowplume waved his fan yet again. Instantly, the 108 fist-sized
raindrops shot out like meteors, slashing through the skies and
smashing towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the first raindrop
smashed directly against Ning’s protective lotus, it broke straight
through the outermost layer of leaves, but was blocked by the red
petals within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power.” Ning could feel the terrifying collisive force of those
raindrops. His current Waterflame Lotus was capable of completely
dominating the vast majority of Wanxiang Adepts, and had even been
capable of blocking Primal Fire, but it had been badly damaged by a
single drop of skywater…most likely, that drop of skywater would
have been enough to smash an ordinary peak Wanxiang Adept to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh
whoosh…many raindrops of skywater came smashing downward. Ning no
longer dared to allow his Waterflame Lotus to take it all head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spin.” Ning held a
Darknorth sword in each hand. Sword-light flashed, and those oncoming
drops of skywater, carrying a savage aura that filled the
heavens…instantly began to swirl around the sword-light Ning had
generated. They had actually been captured and taken control of by
Ning’s sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light was
like water, guiding the drops of skywater in their movements…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The distant
Daoist Snowplume was startled. “A seemingly simple sword attack,
and yet, it contained so many mysteries…Ji Ning’s sword
techniques has already surpassed those of any members of Snowdragon
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll be
forced to rely on raw power to crush him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume didn’t
dare to hesitate. With but a thought, he instantly caused the drops
of skywater that were wildly spinning around the Darknorth swords to
instantly detonate. Boom, boom, boom. The temperature instantly began
to fall, and even the air itself began to freeze. Frost appeared on
Ning’s face, covering it with a layer of white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very cold.” Even
Ning’s Fiendgod-like body felt the cold. “It really is on a
higher level than dire-ice; the cold of this skywater…once it is
unleashed, it quite astonishing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of frost
had condensed in the surrounding area, and a faint mist was beginning
to arise. Suddenly, from within the midst, two snowy Flood Dragons
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Daoist
Snowplume had finally unleashed a killing blow, the powerful magic
treasure which he used to shock the world…the Binary Diffraction
Swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Binary Diffraction
Swords were actually two swords; one yin, and one yang. The swords
would transform into a pair of Flood Dragons with astonishing power.
These were rare magic items, even amongst Heaven-ranked magic items.
When used separately, each would be considered high-grade
Heaven-ranked magic treasures. When used together…their power would
merge, reaching even more shocking levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has executed
his Binary Diffraction Swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the Binary
Diffraction Swords. This Ji Ning is so incredibly powerful…he’s
actually forced Master to use his Binary Diffraction Swords. Even if
he loses, he has much to feel proud about.” The two distant
spectators, Adept Xu Ke and his senior apprentice-brother, both felt
stunned. For their master to have been forced to use the Binary
Diffraction Swords…it meant that the other options which their
master had would not be enough against Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a loud laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So these are the
Binary Diffraction Swords?” With the loud laughter, Ji Ning, who
had been standing in midair unmoving the entire time, suddenly
manifested a pair of black wings behind his back. At the same time,
his body suddenly grew in size as he transformed into a thirty-meter
tall giant. A heroic, terrifying Fiendgod’s aura instantly spread
out, causing all of the spectators to feel their hearts freeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A divine ability!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘Heavenly
Transformation’ divine ability!” Adept Xu Ke and the others,
including the Whitewater Hound, Little Qing, and Ninefire, were all
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew of the
‘Heavenly Transformation’ divine ability, but generally speaking,
one would only transform to ten meters or so in height, while
powerful users might increase to fifteen meters in height. Ning,
however, had actually transformed to thirty meters. His Heavenly
Transformation…had made him an enormous giant with astonishing
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-meter tall
Ning had wings on his back, and the Waterflame Lotus around him. With
a single ‘step’, he transformed into a gust of wind as the swords
in his hands slashed out through the air, leaving behind an
eye-catching, dazzling sword-light. With an explosive sound, the
Binary Diffraction Swords attack, which had sought to defeat Ning,
were knocked flying back.

Chapter 35 - Moving Out of Swallow Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The distant
Daoist Snowplume’s face completely changed. Ning’s power was even
greater than he had expected…but as one of the three Patriarchs of
the sect, how could he just give up so easily?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light of the
Binary Diffraction Swords, which had been knocked flying back,
suddenly increased tremendously in brilliance. One sword completely
transformed into a Flood Dragon whose entire body glowed with blue
light, while the other transformed into a Flood Dragon whose entire
body glowed with golden light. These two Flood Dragons of sword-light
were each three hundred meters long, and the scales on their body
were clearly visible. The eyes of the double dragons were filled with
a killing intent, as though they were alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Flood Dragons
of sword-light, their power having explosively increased, let out
earth-shaking draconic roars as they charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, despite being
thirty meters tall, felt pressure from this attack. The Darknorth
swords in his hands once more sliced out, as though preparing to chop
apart the heavens themselves as they once more left that dazzling
scar of sword-light in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire body
trembled. He felt as though he had been struck by two giant
mountains; he couldn’t help but be knocked back several steps by
the collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow.”
Ning wasn’t shocked; rather, he was delighted! The black wings on
his back began to tremble as he used the Windwing Evasion…and for a
moment, he seemed to be a ghost as he once more charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin-Yang, Divide and
Transform!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Daoist
Snowplume’s face was extremely solemn as well. He now viewed Ning
as a true, worthy opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure Flood Dragon
and the golden Flood Dragon of sword-light, high in the air, once
more let out a series of earthshaking dragon roars as they wildly
enveloped Ning with their attacks. As for Ning, the Darknorth swords
in his hands, he clashed against them repeatedly…and with each
collision, the surrounding air blasted apart and distorted. Even the
water of Serpentwing Lake below them began to distort, with troughs
of many dozens of meters and massive waves of many hundreds of
meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even at a distance of
ten kilometers, Ninefire, Truekeep, Granny Shadow, Autumn Leaf, and
the others who were on Brightheart Island all felt a savage wind
sweep towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is actually
this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the others
were all speechless and stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant, thirty
meter tall Ji Ning was like an exalted god of the heavens, battling
against those two massive Flood Dragons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually able
to battle a peak-stage Primal Daoist to a standstill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s one of the
three Patriarchs of Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only been
ten-plus years since the battle at Oxhorn Mountain, but Ji Ning has
advanced to such a level. If Yichuan were still alive, he would
definitely be incomparably delighted.” Ninefire and the others were
both stunned and excited; after all, the incomparably dazzling figure
before them was the ultimate expert of their Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan’s side
was excited and animated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain’s
side, however, was shocked and enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who was battling
in midair against the two Flood Dragons of sword-light, suddenly
began to move in a different way; the extremely forceful and dynamic
swordplay suddenly became incomparably reserved and stately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light in the
air seemed to have transformed into the light of the moon; it was
incomparably soft. It also seemed like the caress of a
lover…silently, soundless, the two Flood Dragons of sword-light
began to crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daoist
Snowplume was shocked. This sword technique, ‘Yin-Yang, Divide and
Transform’, was an extremely powerful one. And yet, even this
technique was unable to resist Ning? Holding nothing back, he
immediately unleashed the most powerful technique available to him:
“Binary Commingling!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two Flood Dragons
of sword-light, on the verge of collapse, actually began to twist
into each other, connecting into each other as though they were two
living creatures bound into one body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commingling Flood
Dragons of sword-light supported each other, reinforcing each other’s
deficiencies and completely blocking Ning’s sword technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
profoundness of sword techniques, he is absolutely inferior to me.”
Ning knew this quite well. “However, the foundations of Daoist
Snowplume are simply too strong…and those two Heaven-ranked swords
are also exceptionally powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth swords
were Bloodforged weapons; the more one used them to kill, the more
death-energy and baleful energy they would absorb and the more
powerful they would become. However, during the past nine years, Ning
hadn’t killed many people…and so these Darknorth swords continued
to be the equivalent of top-grade Earth-ranked magic treasures.
Compared to the Binary Diffraction Swords, they were unfathomably
weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s superiority in
sword techniques had cancelled out his inferiority in weaponry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to unleash
the advantages of my Fiendgod body.” Ning’s primary goal in this
battle was to test his own ability; however, since the opponent’s
pair of Binary Diffraction Swords had already unleashed a power which
surpassed his most powerful sword techniques, he could no longer just
use sword techniques to compete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
surrounding wind began to howl as Ning himself merged into a gust of
wind, moving with ghostly speed as he charged directly towards Daoist
Snowplume.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine years. Not only
had he improved tremendously in using the Heavenly Transformation
technique, his Windwing Evasion technique had also improved an
astonishing amount. And now, he was unleashing his full power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume was
tremendously shocked, and hurriedly controlled the Binary Diffraction
Swords to try and block Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swordplay
became even softer, only defending and not attacking. In the blink of
an eye, he managed to charge towards Daoist Snowplume’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daoist
Snowplume was shocked; how could he dare fight against Ning in close
combat? If Ning was struck by a sword, by relying on his Fiendgod
body, he could almost instantly heal; if he, Daoist Snowplume, was
struck by a sword, he would only be heavily wounded if he was lucky.
If he wasn’t that lucky, he would truly perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
immediately utilized his own evasive technique. A snowy white light
flashed, and Daoist Snowplume immediately retreated back onto his
warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Adept Xu
Ke and the gray-robed man stared, astonished, at Daoist Snowplume,
who had suddenly appeared in the midst. The two distant streaks of
sword-light flew over as well; it was the Binary Diffraction Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume’s
face was incomparably unsightly to behold. He spoke out, “What a
formidable Ji Ning. Sword Immortals live up to their reputation.
Admirable, admirable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was deep and
it shook the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Daoist Snowplume
finished his words, that gigantic warship instantly soared away,
quickly disappearing into the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair, watching Daoist Snowplume and the others depart. “Daoist
Snowplume is quite a decisive fellow. He hadn’t even lost, but upon
seeing that the current state of affairs was set in stone, he
immediately retreated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had engaged in
this battle, primarily to test his strength. Over the past nine
years, his [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had already
reached the eleventh stage, and he had a body that was comparable to
a peak Fiendgod Body Refiner. The main issue was that after advancing
through one of the major stages, training in the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] would become considerably harder; thus,
in the past, every two or three years, Ning would advance by a stage.
But from the tenth stage to the eleventh stage, Ning had spent six
years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, the amount of
time he had spent was much more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, at least his
Fiendgod body was all but perfect, superior to the likes of
Bloodshadow. In addition, he also had the divine ability,
[Starseizing Hand]; upon using it, his power was no less than that of
a peak Primal Daoist’s! And this was with his [Starseizing Hand]
being only at the first cycle; if he were to train to the second
cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], then the power would be even
greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The training method of
the [Starseizing Hand] was known as the [Six Cycles of the
Starseizer].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the Zifu level, one
could train in the first cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the Wanxiang level,
one could train in the second cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so on and so forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, training in
the [Starseizing Hand] required a large amount of precious essences
of the Five Elements. A large amount of external support was
required. When Ning had trained in the first cycle in the underwater
estate, he had used the Five Elements essence left behind by Daoist
Threelives. Now, however, to train in the second cycle, Ning would
have to go seek out the precious essences by himself. During the past
nine years, although Ning had collected quite a few treasures, he was
still far from having enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A divine body and
divine abilities…with these two, I’m comparable to a peak Primal
Daoist Ki Refiner,” Ning sighed to himself. “My swordplay has
reached the fifth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], and is at a level
even higher than his! But I’m at a disadvantage in terms of
weapons…my Darknorth swords cannot compare to his Binary
Diffraction Swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Binary Diffraction
Swords even possessed some rudimentary sentience. Those two
transformed Flood Dragons held a degree of sentience in their
eyes…but it only made sense. After all, these were high-grade
Heaven-ranked treasures. Upon reaching the higher ‘Immortal-ranked’
treasures, then a treasure spirit would emerge, such as the black
bull of the underwater estate, which was the spirit of the
Immortal-ranked magic treasure which Immortal Juhua had left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A distant group of
people, riding on a leaf-type magic treasure, were flying towards
them. Ninefire and the others were all in a state of delight and
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens. That had
been a peak Primal Daoist! He had actually been forced to retreat by
Ji Ning. They could tell…that when fighting against Daoist
Snowplume, Ning hadn’t been at the slightest disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Ji clan is about
to truly rise to prominence, to true prominence!” Ninefire roared
with laughter. “Haha, I, Ji Ninefire, even at the moment of my
death, will be satisfied. How many years…how many years! My Ji clan
has finally produced such a figure! Ji Ning, I trust that soon, your
name will be known throughout Stillwater Commandery!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your name will be
known throughout Stillwater Commandery. All of the major powers will
known of you and will spread your fame.” Truekeep was excited as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan was merely
a minor power, located in Swallow Mountain. And yet, it had produced
someone like Ji Ning. Someone capable of forcing a Primal Daoist like
Daoist Snowplume to voluntarily retreat…this battle could be
described as the battle which truly established Ji Ning’s
reputation. His fame would be spread throughout the region; after
all, he hadn’t battled a mere middle-stage Primal Daoist, or an
ordinary, unaffiliated practitioner. Daoist Snowplume was a truly
formidable figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t bad. I
didn’t achieve victory, after all,” Ning said. “That Daoist
Snowplume is truly formidable as well; if I were to truly battle him,
it’s hard to say who would win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that Daoist
Snowplume hadn’t really gone all out. Upon realizing that even his
supreme technique, the ‘Binary Commingling’ was unable to do
anything to Ning, he had immediately retreated. If this had been a
true life-or-death battle, however, Daoist Snowplume wouldn’t have
been so stingy in his usage of the skywater in his body; he would
have wildly filled the skies with it as he attacked Ning, while also
controlling flying swords to attack. Ning, in turn, wouldn’t have
tried to avoid injuries and would have wildly fought back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Fiendgod
practitioner, for Ning, injuries were a minor thing. Thus, in a true
life-or-death battle, Ning would’ve had a higher chance of victory!
But that was just hypothetical; after all, no one knew what sort of
treasures Daoist Snowplume carried with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, don’t be
so humble. You beat him into running away! You are a Fiendgod Body
Refiner…I refuse to believe that he would dare fight with you to
the death. When two combatants who are on par with each other fight,
and when one is a Fiendgod Refiner while the other is a Ki Refiner,
it will generally be the Ki Refiner who dies.” Little Qing was
incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the distant
warship, soaring through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume could
still feel his heart trembling. When a Fiendgod practitioner whose
power was on par with his had charged straight towards him…that was
like death sweeping directly for him. He had been so terrified, he
had immediately used an evasive technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Adept Xu Ke
and the gray-robed man didn’t even dare to make a sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple,” Daoist
Snowplume said, looking at Adept Xu Ke, “Go and have your Xu clan
immediately evacuate from Swallow Mountain. Ideally, avoid any and
all trouble with the Ji clan in the future. Although Snowdragon
Mountain doesn’t fear them, they don’t need to fear Snowdragon
Mountain either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Adept Xu Ke
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon, the news of
this battle will be spread throughout the entire Stillwater
Commandery.” Daoist Snowplume shook his head. “I truly didn’t
expect…that I, Snowplume, would end up becoming a stepping stone
for another’s rise to fame.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume, as
someone capable of reaching the Primal Daoist level, was no fool. He
knew very well…that given Ji Ning’s monstrous rate of
improvement, this was someone that he absolutely could not be enemies
with. Ning had only been alive for thirty short years, but he was
already comparable to Daoist Snowplume, who had trained for a
thousand years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, listen
clearly.” Daoist Snowplume swept the crowd with his gaze. “You
are absolutely not permitted to antagonize Ji Ning! If you do, even
my Snowdragon Mountain will find it difficult to protect you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them assented.
Nobody who had witnessed the earlier battle had the courage to go
antagonize Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News of this battle
spread with astonishing speed. Daoist Snowplume didn’t issue an
order of silence to his subordinates, because he knew that even if
Snowdragon Mountain didn’t spread the news, the Ji clan would.
Given the situation, it was best for them to pretend to ignore it all
and allow the news to spread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given this Ji Ning’s
rate of improvement, I imagine that very soon, he will become even
more illustrious and famous. For me to be the stepping-stone to fame
for someone like him…it’s not that embarrassing…” This was
how Daoist Snowplume tried to console himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news quickly spread
to the center of the entire Stillwater Commandery; Stillwater City.
Amongst Ning’s friends, the first to receive word was, naturally,
Northmont Baiwei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, good, good,
good!” Baiwei excitedly slapped his desk, causing the fruit
platters and wine bottles atop it to rattle, then tumble to the
floor. The nearby musicians were badly startled by this sudden act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Piao An.” Baiwei
looked at the messenger servant, who was kneeling before him. He
immediately beamed and said, “You have rendered a great merit by
delivering this report. I shall award you ten taels of liquefied
elemental essence.” He immediately tossed a jade bottle over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The servant before him,
who had just reached the Zifu Disciple level, accepted it with great
excitement. This was an intelligence report that came from the spy
network of Northmont Blacktiger’s estate; he was nothing more than
a messenger boy. And yet, just like that, he had acquired ten taels
of liquefied elemental essence; clearly, young master Baiwei was
exceedingly delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My brother, Ji Ning,
truly is formidable. Formidable. Formidable!” Baiwei excitedly
stalked back and forth within his hall. “How long has it been? Just
ten years since he entered the Black-White College? He’s only a
peak Wanxiang Adept, and yet he’s already capable of forcing Daoist
Snowplume into a retreat and to relocate his local Snowdragon
Mountain branch. Clearly, Daoist Snowplume has lowered his head!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst the third
generation disciples of the Black-White College, I imagine that only
the likes of the Sloppy Daoist and Holyfire are capable of matching
my brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the Sloppy
Daoist and Holyfire have all trained for at least two centuries,
while Ji Ning has only trained for thirty years.” Baiwei was
delighted for his friend…and he felt all the more convinced that he
had truly hit the jackpot when he had decided to become friends with
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The excited Baiwei
suddenly saw, out of the corner of his eye, the pole-axed, stupefied
group of musicians. Only now did he remember that he was actually
listening to a private concert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out, out, all of
you.” Baiwei waved his hand. The musicians, including his
maidservant, all bowed and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei’s eyes were
filled with anticipation. “I hope that Brother Ji Ning isn’t
going to trip and fall on his Immortal path…given his rate of
improvement, which is vastly superior to that of the Sloppy Daoist
and Holyfire, and even vastly superior to most reincarnated
Immortals…as long as he doesn’t die, when he becomes an Immortal,
he will definitely become a top-tier Immortal. By then…I’ll truly
have a powerful supporter by my side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news also quickly
made its way to the Black-White College. Daoist Flowcloud, also known
as Chen Jin, had just returned from a relaxing trip to the Carefree
Caverns. He was feeling quite rested and relaxed, and had just flown
back into and landed within his own mountain estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of his ten
retainers, both female, immediately came to greet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Chen
Jin gave these two retainers a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud, you wanted us to keep track of any
information regarding senior apprentice-brother Darknorth, right?”
One of the female retainers, the slightly skinnier one, hurriedly
said, “We just heard…that senior apprentice-brother Darknorth, Ji
Ning, engaged in a battle with one of the three Patriarchs of
Snowdragon Mountain, Daoist Snowplume, at Serpentwing Lake. Ji Ning’s
power filled the heavens, and in the end, he forced Daoist Snowplume
to retreat and even voluntarily relocate the local Snowdragon
Mountain branch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Chen Jin’s
good mood instantly and completely evaporated. His face was ashen.
“Did you perhaps mishear things? Ji Ning was actually able to force
Daoist Snowplume into retreating? He has this level of power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We didn’t mishear.
This news just made its way to the Black-White College, and it has
been spread throughout the College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Everyone is
talking about it right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of the female
retainers answered together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chen Jin’s face was
utterly pale. Ning had become the shadow over his heart long ago; for
Ning to become even more dazzling naturally caused him to feel even
more enraged. He barked angrily, “Describe the information you
heard in detail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Flowcloud, this event originated from a dispute
between the Ji clan of Swallow Mountain and the local branch of
Snowdragon Mountain…” The skinnier female retainer began to
speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sloppy, Ji
Ning, by the look of things, seems to have improved quite a bit. He’s
already reached the same level as Holyfire and the others, and might
even be comparable with you.” Within a spacious, lavish hall, a
short old man who was dressed in beggar’s clothes was seated on the
ground. In front of him were a number of bowls, filled with various
types of meat and other food. He stretched out a grubby, greasy hand
and snatched a chunk of meat from a bowl while using his other hand
to pour wine into his mouth from a gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him was a
fat and similarly sloppy-looking youth. He, too, was using one hand
to grab at the food and eating with abandon, while using his other
hand to drink from a gourd of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he is
comparable to me?” The fat youth didn’t seem to be concerned at
all, continuing to eat and drink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sloppy, that
means that your reputation as being the number one figure amongst the
third generation disciples of the Black-White College might be taken
away,” the short elder hurriedly warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fat youth shook his
head. “When I first joined the Black-White College, I was
completely unremarkable. Back then, there were countless senior
fellow disciples who were stronger than me. But in the end, I
surpassed them all…and that’s when I became the ‘number one
figure’ amongst the third generation disciples. But has that
reputation ever done anything for me in terms of helping me improve
in power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nope, not at all!”
The fat youth seemed completely unconcerned. “In the Black-White
College, I can rank at the very top, but if we look at the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty and the major world they have unified…given how
there are thousands on thousands of reincarnated Immortals at the
Wanxiang level, I imagine that there are far more people that are
more powerful than me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why it
doesn’t matter at all what my ranking is within the Black-White
College. I only have one opponent; myself. As long as I continue to
surpass myself and improve…that’ll be enough.” The fat youth
shook his head. “This is also the reason why I won’t go to the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. This
time, the imperial capital of the Grand Xia has attracted interest
from the most powerful geniuses of virtually every commandery city in
this boundless world. In fact, even some of the supreme talents who
live in the seas beyond are heading towards the capital! This is an
event that will only occur every three centuries! Only those who are
below the Primal Daoist level are allowed to attend. This is a chance
that only comes in three hundred years! Once you defeat the various
reincarnated Immortals and geniuses of the other parts of the world,
then you’ll truly soar to the heavens!” The short elder said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m afraid of
death.” The fat youth shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You sloppy bastard!”
The short elder was so angry, he began to curse. “How can you be so
lazy in pursuing your Immortal path?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m in no rush.
I’m going to train slowly. If there’s good wine, I’ll drink it;
if there’s tasty meat, I’ll eat it. I’ll live a wonderfully
happy life. Whatever level I’ll end up training to, that’ll be
the level I’ll train to. I’m not going to go risk my life.” The
fat youth shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder was
completely helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still..he felt great
admiration for this fat youth. In fact, he even began to wonder…if
perhaps, in terms of Dao-heart alone, this fat youth might be
stronger than all of the Primal Daoists and Immortals of the entire
Black-White College! Still…there was no way one could tell from the
surface if another had a powerful Dao-heart or not. To this very day,
he was the only one who believed that this fat youth had the
strongest Dao-heart of anyone in the entire Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning truly is formidable. We haven’t seen him
in ten years, but he’s grown so powerful.” Mu Northson, who had
completely absorbed himself into the art of constructs during recent
years, was exceptionally excited upon hearing this news. “It’s
been so many years since I’ve seen him…it’s time for me to pay
a visit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how powerful Ning
had shown himself to be during this battle, there truly were quite a
few who wanted to go pay a visit to him now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson just made some
casual inquiries, and soon, a large group of people gathered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to
Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been years
since we’ve seen junior apprentice-brother Darknorth. He has grown
so powerful.” More than ten people had decided to go visit Ning,
most of whom were on extremely good terms with him. There were even
two reincarnated Immortals amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one’s power
reached a certain level, one would naturally be acknowledged by
others. Soon, this group of ten-plus fellow disciples left the
Black-White College and headed towards Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Immortal Diancai, seated on his jade bed, opened his eyes, revealing
a smile within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many young
fellows have gone to visit Ji Ning. It seems my apprentice’s
strength has been acknowledged by his fellow disciples. In fact, come
to think of it…if he was able to force Daoist Snowplume to retreat,
then my apprentice’s [Three-Foot Sword] must have reached an
extremely deep level of expertise. Is he at the fourth stance, or the
fifth stance? Ugh, this kid…he didn’t visit me a single time in
ten years,” Immortal Diancai mused to himself. Because only six
stances of the [Three-Foot Sword] were made public within the
Black-White College, even Immortal Diancai himself had only learned
those first six stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But naturally, Immortal
Diancai’s most powerful sword technique wasn’t the [Three-Foot
Sword]; it was the one he had established for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle had truly
brought fame to Ji Ning. His name was spread throughout the entire
Stillwater Commandery. His friends, his seniors, his elders, and even
other large clans and sects began to pay close attention to him. From
this day onward, Ji Ning had become one of the notable, well-known
figures of the Stillwater Commandery region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distant
Highwater Commandery. The Dongyan Mountains. Within a quiet, secluded
cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A snowy white-robed
Ninelotus was seated in the lotus position atop a boulder. She had
been trapped within this Myriad Lotuses Cave for nearly nine years
now. Almost every day, she came to try and break through the
formation, but the formation set down by the Forefather of the
Dongyan clan was a reflection of one’s Dao-heart; to break the
formation, one had to thoroughly comprehend one’s own Dao-heart and
to thoroughly understand one’s self!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus had never
been successful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress, mistress.”
A voice rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus opened her
eyes. “What is it?” Although she couldn’t leave, her servants
could still bring her news from the outside world through the most
simplest of methods; by standing outside the cave and shouting
towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress, we just
received word that the Ji clan of Swallow Mountain has forced the
local branch of Snowdragon Mountain to leave. This caused one of the
three Patriarchs of Snowdragon Mountain, Daoist Snowplume, to be
angered and personally make a trip to Serpentwing Lake. However, that
Ji Ning wasn’t willing to lower his head at all, and so he and
Daoist Snowplume got into a battle,” the servant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was instantly
furious, frantic, and concerned. “That idiot! How could he be so
forceful about it? That’s a peak Primal Daoist!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daost Snowplume used
his supreme techniques with the Binary Diffraction Swords to battle
against Ji Ning, but Ji Ning used his divine ability to transform
into a thirty meter tall giant. He unleashed an incomparably
astonishing sword technique…and was actually able to force Daoist
Snowplume to voluntarily retreat, and even lower his head and have
the Swallow Mountain branch leave,” the servant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ninelotus
was astonished.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_37___Leaving_the_Myriad"></A>
Chapter 37 - Leaving the Myriad Lotuses Cave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was truly
surprised. Although she felt great admiration for Ji Ning, the young,
handsome, fragile-looking Ning made her think of her own younger
brothers. Ninelotus felt an almost maternally protective instinct
towards Ning, and the fact that he loved to lie in his boat and drift
above the waters of Serpentwing Lake further stirred the soft
feelings inside her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew that Ning was
extremely talented, but she hadn’t expected him to be this
talented. His level of monstrousness had already surpassed what even
she had imagined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College has three reincarnated Immortals at the Wanxiang Level.
Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei has spent the least amout of time
training, while the other two reincarnated Immortals have trained for
more than ninety years. Ji Ning has only trained for thirty, but he’s
already comparable to the two of them, and perhaps even stronger.”
Ninelotus suddenly began to feel a bit of panic in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though her Ji
Ning had surpassed the limits of what she could comprehend and
control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why am I panicking?
Why am I so uneasy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus immediately
realized that her emotions were off. “For Ji Ning to be powerful is
a good thing. Why am I so nervous and restless?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She asked herself this
question, over and over. She questioned herself repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past nine
years of her ‘imprisonment’ within the Myriad Lotuses Cave, she
had continuously attempted to challenge the Dao-heart illumination
formation which the Forefather of the Dongyan clan had left behind.
Actually, she was already quite close to ‘comprehending her own
heart’. Upon feeling uncontrollable nervousness and restlessness
when learning that Ji Ning had forced a peak Primal Daoist to lower
his head…she finally broke through the final barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…is me?”
Ninelotus suddenly calmed down. Her eyes no longer appeared lost; the
only thing left was the calmness of the vast, endless sea. “So this
is who I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m used to being
in control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I like to control
everything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to be in
control of everything I am surrounded by. I am going to command the
Dongyan clan and lead it to greater heights, to spread my name
throughout the entire Grand Xia Dynasty.” Ninelotus murmured softly
to herself. Ever since she was young, she had been ambitious, but she
had never truly understood her own nature as clearly as she did now.
In the past, she merely acted in accordance with her subconscious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had gone to be a
disciple of the Black-White College because she wanted to prove
herself, and prove to herself, that even without the assistance of
the Forefather of the Dongyan clan, she was still capable of entering
the likes of the Black-White College, where only supreme geniuses
were admitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why she had
never been moved by Chen Jin was because there was no way she could
control the ‘Chen clan’ which stood behind him. And thus, she
subconsciously rejected his advances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason she was
moved by Ji Ning…was precisely because Ji Ning’s clan, the Ji
clan, was very weak; thus, she was completely capable of controlling
and guiding it. Ning himself was extremely talented, but his talent
was still within the realm of what she, as the next leader of the
Dongyan clan, was capable of controlling. So long as Ning did not
become a Celestial Immortal, he would not be out of her sphere of
control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all…Ning’s parentage and history had truly moved her inner heart.
She wanted to protect him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s even more
powerful than I had predicted.” Understanding her own nature,
Ninelotus now calmed down. “However, even if he truly does become a
Celestial Immortal in the future…that’ll be something that
happens many, many years from now. After so many years together, the
affection between the two of us will become incomparably deep and
stable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In her heart, Ninelotus
didn’t truly believe in ‘love at first sight’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She believed more
in…love built up over time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Forefather said
that becoming Dao-Companions means being willing to die for each
other,” Ninelotus murmured to herself. “Perhaps I’m not yet
able to do that for him, but in a thousand years, I believe that I
will truly, whole-heartedly, be willing to die for him. He’ll be
willing to die for me too.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus no longer
hesitated; she immediately walked towards the grand formation. The
grand formation of the Dao-heart had impeded Ninelotus for nearly
nine years…but this time, it no longer did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus walked out of
the Myriad Lotuses Cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress.” The
female servant outside, upon seeing Ninelotus walk out, immediately
knelt down in surprise and delight. “Congratulations and
felicitations, mistress.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus smiled
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus left the
Highwater Commandery and the Dongyan Mountains, heading towards
Swallow Mountain of Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sun was brilliant
this day. The Forefather of the Dongyan clan, still leisurely fishing
within the gorge, revealed a look of surprise on his face. He
murmured softly to himself, “Ruyin, although she physically appears
very similar to you, and on the surface has a temperament similar to
yours…her true nature is completely opposite to yours. Ninelotus’
heart is far stronger and harder than yours. She truly was born to
lead. It seems that when I chose her to be the next leader of the
Dongyan clan…it was a choice that will lead the Dongyan clan to
great glory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei and Ji
Ning were seated facing each other, toasting each other and laughing
and chatting loudly and happily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! There’s one
thing that you never found out about,” Baiwei suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The one who killed
Yu Dong and Adept Mooncrescent was you, right?” Baiwei first set up
a restrictive spell around them, blocking out all sound, then
continued to speak softly. Ning didn’t hesitate; he immediately
nodded. He had originally asked Baiwei to help acquire the
intelligence reports regarding Yu Dong, Shui Yi, and Dong Seven. It
wasn’t strange that Baiwei would be able to guess that he had done
the deed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mooncrescent
had an extraordinary background,” Baiwei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What background?”
Ning was startled, although he had guessed at this long ago, which
was why he had been so cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Mooncrescent
was a retired Immortal cultivator of one of the secret Immortal
armies our Northmont clan controls, the ‘Shadow Army’,” Baiwei
said seriously. “You should know that after having experienced
life-and-death battles with each other repeatedly, soldiers develop
extremely deep ties with each other. Incredibly few manage to survive
all the way into retirement. If any retirees are killed, then their
old brothers will definitely stand up for them…and in fact the
entire Shadow Army will support them, because they have to be able to
guarantee that the retirees will have safe, comfortable lives in
their final years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. So
this was the situation? It really had been a secret Immortal army of
the Northmont clan of Stillwater?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the Northmont
clan’s intelligence network, they should have already found me
out.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they did, you
wouldn’t have been able to spend the past ten years in security and
peace.” Baiwei shook his head. Ning’s battle with Chen Jin had
been after spending a year back at Serpentwing Lake, and then he had
spent nearly nine more years…indeed, he had been back for nearly
ten years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei said softly,
“The Shadow Army’s investigation traced the clues all the way to
my estate, the Northmont Blacktiger estate. However, in the end, the
Shadow Army is in service to our Northmont clan of Stillwater. They
wouldn’t dare do anything to the Northmont Blacktiger estate, and
so in the end, our estate stonewalled them. The Shadow Army was
forced to just give up; they weren’t able to continue the
investigation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. So
it had been all thanks to the help from the estate of Northmont
Blacktiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, what Ning
didn’t realize was that the loyalty of an army to its patron was an
incredibly important thing. The Northmont clan had to take care of
the feelings of their Immortal armies; thus, things couldn’t have
been handled as simply as Baiwei had just implied. In truth, Baiwei
himself had taken on the blame for this matter, informing the Shadow
Army that it was he, Northmont Baiwei, an important young master of
the Northmont clan, who had unknowingly killed one of their old
retirees. There was no way the Shadow Army could act against such an
important young master of the Northmont clan, and thus they had been
forced to give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in both his past
life and his present life, didn’t understand politics very well.
Naturally, he wouldn’t understand that Baiwei had made sacrifices
on his behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Brother
Baiwei. Please thank Uncle as well,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter, a
minor matter.” Laughing, Baiwei waved his hand in dismissal, then
lowered his voice again. “Brother Ji Ning, I heard some stories
about you and your senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You even know about
this?!” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei nodded. “One
time, when I was drinking at the Carefree Caverns, I invited Holyfire
over. At that time, Chen Jin was present as well. I mentioned you to
them, thinking that since you were fellow disciples, by mentioning
your name, it would help all of us be better friends. Who would’ve
thought that Chen Jin’s face would immediately turn ugly and that
he would he quickly leave? Afterwards, I asked Holyfire about this
matter, and thus learned about the details of the situation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
Shaking his head, Ning laughed, “To be honest, it’s a bit funny.
Ninelotus had never felt anything for Chen Jin, but Chen Jin himself,
in a hotheaded fit, insisted on dealing with me…but unfortunately,
I ended up dealing with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei shook his head.
“I can tell that he feels deep hatred for you. Given how
narrow-minded he is…it’ll be hard for him to accomplish any great
deeds. Chen Jin is of the impressive Chen clan of Highwater…who
would’ve thought that he’d be so narrow-minded? I imagine that
the Chen clan must not have provided him with very good tutelage;
most likely, he hasn’t been selected to be the next leader of their
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Major clans viewed the
training and tutelage of their future leaders as something of
paramount importance. They had to whole-heartedly strive to provide
the proper upraising for a suitable leader. Clearly, Chen Jin wasn’t
such a person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a voice rang
out which instantly echoed across the entire Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?!” Ning
instantly rose to his feet, his face covered with delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You look so happy,
who is it?” Baiwei was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s my junior
apprentice-brother, Northson,” Ning said in delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Northmont
Baiwei immediately flew into the air to welcome him. A dragon-headed
warship was flying towards them, with an entire group of Immortal
cultivators aboard it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people?”
Ning was surprised as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these people
were at the Wanxiang level. Even Bloodshadow and Yu Wei had come. In
the Black-White College, they were all considered elites. In total,
fifteen people had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Northson was the first to fly over to
Ning, and he excitedly pounded his fist against Ning’s chest.
“Incredible! Even an old fellow at the peak Primal Daoist stage was
sent scurrying away by you. In the past, when we met with that
Dragonwhale King, we found it so difficult to deal with him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, there
wasn’t a conclusive end to the fight,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed,
white-haired Bloodshadow spoke out. “Junior apprentice-brother, no
need to be modest; you are a Fiendgod Refiner, while Daoist Snowplume
is a Ki Refiner; in a situation where both sides are equally matched,
Ki Refiners generally won’t dare to fight all out against Fiendgod
Refiners. He retreated was because he did indeed fear you, feared
dying at your hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this, no
longer tried to equivocate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” A beautiful, black-robed maiden looked
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei.” Ning hurriedly acknowledged her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During his first Dao
Debate, in the end, it had been Yu Wei who defeated Ning. During the
past nine years, when Ning had gone to the Raindragon Guard branch to
accept missions, he heard some news about Yu Wei; during the past
nine years, she had become a brilliant star as well, and had even
defeated a middle-stage Primal Daoist. Her reputation was outstanding
and no less than his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we were to
compete again, even I might not be able to defeat you, junior
apprentice-brother,” the black-robed maiden said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, you are being too modest,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me make the
introductions. You probably don’t recognize these people yet.”
The black-robed maiden pointed to a nearby gray-robed man with deep
eyes. “This is senior apprentice-brother Vastriver. He is often
adventuring in the outside world. We just so happened to run into him
in the Black-White College, and so he accompanied us to come visit
you, junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Vastriver? The Black-White College only had three reincarnated
Immortals at the Wanxiang level. Yu Wei was one, while Adept
Vastriver was another. He had also trained for a very long period of
time, and only rarely appeared for brief periods of time. This truly
was the first time Ning had met him.

Chapter 38 - The Tricentennial Conclave of Immortal Destiny
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed man
couldn’t be said to be handsome, but he truly did have an
extraordinary aura. Actually, as a reincarnated Immortal, and one who
had long ago mastered a complete Dao Path, he should have awakened
quite a few memories of his former life. Thus, his aura would be
affected, naturally making him seem different from the crowd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth,” Daoist Vastriver said, smiling
towards Ning, “I heard of your reputation long ago, but because
I’ve always been adventuring, we haven’t had the chance to meet.
This time, upon my return, I heard that you defeated Daoist
Snowplume…you truly are impressive, quite impressive. Amongst the
third generation disciples of our Black-White College, only junior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei is a match for you in training speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t compare to
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Yu Wei said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are being
modest. Junior apprentice-sister, three years ago, you completely
mastered the Dao of the Freeze; compared to the two of you, myself
and Vileslayer are truly ashamed,” Adept Vastwave said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, you were able to comprehend a complete Dao
Path so quickly! Only junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is a match
for you,” the nearby Bloodshadow said with a laugh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
surprised. By the sound of it…quite a few people knew that Yu Wei
had mastered a complete Dao Path. Vastriver and Bloodshadow, at
least, knew about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formidable! Yu Wei
wasn’t actually that old; she was only roughly ten or so years
older than Ning himself! And yet, she had already completely
comprehended an entire Dao Path, and the Dao of the Freeze, at that!
It must be understood that when Yu Wei had defeated Ning during their
initial Dao Debate, she had used techniques pertaining to fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, aren’t you the ‘Rainbowflame Fairy’? Are you
actually more talented in ice?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s skilled in
both ice and fire,” Adept Vastriver sighed. “Although we are all
reincarnated Immortals, there are still differences between us. Some
reincarnated Immortals were ordinary Earth Immortals or Loose
Immortals, while others were Loose Immortals who had trained for
hundreds of thousands of years…in her past life, junior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei must have been an incredible Loose
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei said, resigned,
“We’ve come to congratulate junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning;
why do you all keep talking about me? Junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning, we’ve come to your place…are you going to just have us keep
chatting here in midair? Aren’t you even going to offer us a glass
of wine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, of course,”
Ning immediately led the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiring group
of Black-White College disciples chatted and laughed amongst
themselves as they arrived at Brightheart Island. Autumn Leaf had
already arranged for the servants to prepare in advance; how could
they dare to be negligent in taking care of so many disciples of the
Black-White College?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire group stayed
here for time; some stayed for just two or three days, then returned
on their own. Northson, Yu Wei, Vastriver, and Baiwei continued to
spend some more time at the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this day, the sky
was completely cloudless, for as far as the eye could see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group was
aboard a large ship on Serpentwing Lake. They were seated, drinking
Immortal wine, and eating spirit-fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei,” Adept Vastriver, seated opposite from
her, spoke out, “There are three more years before the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny. What do you plan to do during these three years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whatever I feel
like.” The black-robed maiden, Yu Wei, sat there while viewing her
surroundings. “I’ll stroll about and do what I please. When
enough time has passed, I’ll go directly to the imperial capital of
the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let me
congratulate you in advance, Rainbowflame Fairy, for spreading your
name throughout the world,” Baiwei said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson stared. “Wait,
wait. What are you all talking about? What Conclave of Immortal
Destiny? What’s this about the imperial capital? And spreading
one’s name throughout the world? Hey, senior apprentice-brother…do
you know what they are talking about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Puzzled, Ning shook his
head as well. “What are you all talking about? Why haven’t I
heard of this before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei said, “This
Conclave of Immortal Destiny is an event which the founding emperor
of the Grand Xia Dynasty established. All Immortal cultivators
beneath the rank of Primal Daoist are permitted to participate. This
is a tournament of the truly supreme geniuses of the world. Our Grand
Xia Dynasty has unified this major world, which holds 3600
commanderies and many oceanic territories…I can’t even imagine
how many monstrous geniuses and reincarnated Immortals will be
attending this event.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A tournament of
geniuses?” Ning was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Although it
is called the ‘Conclave of Immortal Destiny’, it should really be
called the ‘Tournament of Geniuses’,” Baiwei said with a sigh.
“This is because one must be below the Primal Daoist level…thus,
almost all the participants are peak Wanxiang Adepts. The peak
Wanxiang Adepts who participate are geniuses who come from the
various commandery cities and oceanic territories…I can’t help
but shudder, just thinking about it. Generally speaking, those who
dare participate are, at the very least, comparable to Primal
Daoists!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look on Ning’s
face grew solemn as well. He now understood. If all the geniuses of
this entire major world were to gather in one place…it must be
understood that the Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery,
alone, already had the likes of the Sloppy Daoist, Holyfire,
Vastriver, and Yu Wei. Stillwater Commandery had other schools and
sects and clans as well, some of whom had brought up their own
heaven-defying geniuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every commandery would
have tens of such geniuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty
controlled 3600 commanderies, and oceanic territories as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words…the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty most likely had more than a hundred thousand
individuals on the level of Holyfire and Vastriver!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t have
some true ability, going and participating is suicide,” Baiwei
said. “The reason you never learned about it is because you weren’t
strong enough, and so the Black-White College never notified you.
After all, your defeat of Daoist Snowplume is a recent event.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that you
want to go?” Baiwei looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not in a rush
to,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, too, feel that
you don’t need to go. After all, you’ve only trained for thirty
years. That’s too short a period of time,” Baiwei said. “You
might as well just stop at the Wanxiang level and train for another
three centuries and wait for the next Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
If you go then…you will definitely shock the world. I know quite a
few supreme talents who insisted on waiting for three centuries, and
in the process mastered multiple complete Dao Paths!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Multiple Dao Paths?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how high a
level of comprehension they have, why not become Primal Daoists or
Earth Immortals? Why insist on forcing themselves to remain at the
Wanxiang level?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Northson
also said hurriedly, “Right. Why suppress themselves for so long?
Is the Conclave of Immortal Destiny truly so enticing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t
understand,” the nearby Adept Vastriver spoke out. Baiwei and Yu
Wei looked towards Ning and Northson as well. Vastriver continued,
“This Conclave of Immortal Destiny …those who rank in the top
three will acquire an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal-ranked?!”
Northson cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single
Immortal-ranked magic treasure shouldn’t be enticing enough,”
Ning said with a frown. Anyone capable of comprehending multiple Dao
Paths in three centuries would definitely be a truly monstrous
genius; someone like this, upon becoming an Earth Immortal, shouldn’t
find it too hard to acquire an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s just the
nominal prize,” the black-robed Yu Wei said. “Participating in
the Conclave of Immortal Destiny is a chance to skyrocket to the
heavens in prominence. It’s a chance to allow the entire Grand Xia
Dynasty to pay attention to you. If you rank in the top ten…just
for the sake of becoming friends with you, some of the major clans
might give you five thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence, or even more. That might not be too much from a single clan,
but if multiple clans were to do the same…your hands would go limp
from receiving liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But all that is
secondary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most important
part of this event lies in the words, ‘Immortal Destiny’.” The
black-robed maiden looked at Ning. “If you rank in the top ten of
this event, then you’ll be able to apprentice yourself to some
truly major powers. Generally speaking, if you do so, you’ll have a
much higher chance of becoming a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Major power?” Ning
hurriedly asked, “Major powers of where?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver said in
a low voice, “Perhaps some of the truly supreme powers of this
major world who have been in seclusion…or perhaps powerful figures
from outside this major world. No matter what, they will definitely
be more powerful than Celestial Immortals! I’ll tell the two of you
one more thing…more than 80% of Celestial Immortals we know of
first came to prominence during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny,
where they were accepted by major powers as disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a chance, a
chance to show your prowess and let the major figures of the Three
Realms to see how talented you are.” Adept Vastriver looked at Ji
Ning and Northson. “Understand, now? Understand why so many
geniuses are willing to stay at the Wanxiang level for three
centuries? It’s all for the sake of being able to show their
prowess and blaze brilliantly during the Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei sighed as well,
“Reincarnated Immortals like us are nothing. Earth Immortals? Loose
Immortals? We are nothing at all. Only becoming Celestial Immortals
will one become truly carefree and unrestrained! But how hard is it
to become a Celestial Immortal? The entire Black-White College, in
all its history, has only produced a single one. But this Conclave of
Immortal Destiny…this is a moment of true destiny. Naturally, one
has to grasp it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
completely understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming a Celestial
Immortal was too hard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a major power of the
Three Realms was willing to give some guidance, it would be much
easier. For example, if Daoist Threelives were to personally teach
and train Ning, his own Immortal path would naturally be much more
quickly traversed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny…this was a chance for one to attract attention
from major figures of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beyond Celestial
Immortals in power?” Northson couldn’t help but ask, “All I
know is that Celestial Immortals have surpassed the restrictions of
the Three Realms and are able to roam about, carefree. What is above
a Celestial Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Vastriver
exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei said slowly,
“True Immortals! True Immortals of Pure Yang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortals?”
Northson murmured these two words to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the
prerequisites for becoming a Celestial Immortal is the comprehension
of an entire Dao Path,” Yu Wei said. “Mastering an entire Grand
Dao Path, however, is the prerequisite for becoming a True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson nodded gently.
Ning did the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them both
knew what Grand Daos were. Ning’s Dao of the Sword was a Grand
Dao…and Northson’s Dao of Constructs was also a Grand Dao!
However, it was even more difficult and rare to completely master and
control the Grand Dao of Constructs than it was to completely master
the Grand Dao of the Sword. Some Immortals were said to be ‘skilled’
in constructing constructs, but to clain true, complete mastery over
the Grand Dao of Constructs? Not even the legends mentioned such a
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And that’s just a
prerequisite. To surpass the Celestial Immortal level…how
incredible must that be? Any such person would be considered a
formidable figure of the Three Realms. Generally speaking, those who
are chosen during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny will ‘only’
become honorary disciples…but even being a mere gate-guard for such
a major power is more exalted than being a prince of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, to say nothing of an honorary disciple,” Adept Vastriver
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson both
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those figures could be
considered major powers of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly thought
of the master of the underwater estate - Daoist Threelives. He was a
Primordial Fiendgod, who had been born from the primordial chaos with
the complete mastery of a Grand Dao. Afterwards, he had mastered many
other Grand Daos, and then developed the [Starseizing Hand], ranked
as one of the top ten divine abilities out of the innumerable divine
abilities that had been created after Pangu had established the
universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master said that
only after I become an Empyrean God can I be considered his disciple.
I wonder how strong Master is, compared to a True Immortal,” Ning
mused to himself.
</P>

Chapter 39 - Meeting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei…” After realizing how brutal this
Immortal Conclave could be, Ning couldn’t help but look towards Yu
Wei. “You’ve only trained for ten more years than me, and in this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, there are monsters who have trained for
more than three centuries. Isn’t it going to be very dangerous for
you? If you truly are going to go, why don’t you wait for three
more centuries?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed maiden,
Yu Wei, gently shook her head. “Three centuries is too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I tried to dissuade
her as well,” Adept Vastriver said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true. It
really is too dangerous. The most elite participants of the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny, although still only at the peak Wanxiang level,
have insight into the Dao that is definitely at the level of
Immortals, and perhaps even higher than ordinary Immortals. Some are
geniuses like our junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, except they have
insisted on staying at this level for three centuries, for the sake
of this battle.” Similarly worried, Baiwei continued, “Rainbowflame
Fairy, although you are a reincarnated Immortal, you’ve spent too
little time in training. Unless you’ve completely awakened your
former memories…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If that was to happen,
then one would immediately gain all of the insights one had from
one’s previous life. In that case, she might have a shot!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny…most of the people there will have mastered a
complete Dao Path.” Yu Wei shook her head. “Very, very few will
have mastered even two Dao Paths, and if one has mastered three, I
imagine that one would be able to rank in the top ten. In
comprehending the Dao, one might quickly gain insights into the Daos
that one is suited for, but for the others…comprehending them will
only become slower and slower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the Grand
Dao of the Sword, Ning had aptitude for the Dao of the Inferno, the
Dao of Rainwater, and the Dao of the Gale. If he had an additional
century, he had a chance of completely mastering these three Dao
Paths, but if he had to go and comprehend a fourth or fifth…even if
he had three hundred more years, he might not be able to do it. This
is because he didn’t even have the most rudimentary of insights
into other Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’ve only
mastered a single Dao Path,” Yu Wei said with a laugh, “I am
still gaining some fragmented memories from my previous life, which
have taught me some secret arts. I’m considerably stronger than
those people who have just recently mastered a Dao Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To try and hit the
top ten? I have no chance.” Yu Wei shook her head. “But, I should
be able to keep myself alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Baiwei, and the
others exchanged glances. Since Yu Wei had made her stance clear,
they found it difficult to continue to try and dissuade her. In
addition, reincarnated Immortals were quite special to begin with;
perhaps they might suddenly gain all of their former memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my past life, I
failed my tribulation; in this life, I naturally must be courageous
and valiant in moving forward.” Yu Wei’s eyes were shining. “This
Conclave of Immortal Destiny will be a chance to fight against many
truly top-tier geniuses. This is a chance to test and temper myself,
a chance that truly comes once in a lifetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was suddenly
swayed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to fight
against so many geniuses…and all of whom were below the Primal
Daoist level. After breaking through to the Primal Daoist level, one
would no longer have a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I go or not?”
Ning began to ponder. “Yu Wei spoke of three Dao Paths allowing one
to enter the top ten. Each additional Dao Path gained represents a
major increase in power…I’m still quite far away from
comprehending three Dao Paths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have three more
years. I’ll wait and see. Let’s see how much more powerful I
become in these next three years,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning
made up his mind that in the next three years, he would
whole-heartedly devote himself to increasing his power as much as
possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yuwei, senior apprentice-brother Vastriver.” Ning
looked towards his two senior fellow disciples. Yu Wei and Vastriver
looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if the two
of you would be willing to stay at my Serpentwing Lake for an
extended period of time. As your junior apprentice-brother, I’d
love the chance to ask the two of you for some pointers,” Ning
said. “During the past few years, only Daoist Snowplume has been a
true match for me; the other few times, when I went chasing after
those criminals, I’ve never really enjoyed a good fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” Daoist
Vastriver laughed as well. “It is indeed hard to find a good match.
Junior apprentice-brother, you walk the path of the Sword Immortal; I
hear that they are very skilled at battle. I want to compete with you
as well, junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded and
laughed as well. “I have nowhere to go before attending the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Before I go out and fight against the
countless geniuses of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty, I might as well
stay here and spar with you…perhaps this will allow my power to
increase once again. However, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you
need to prepare fine wine and delicacies; senior apprentice-brother
Vastriver and I are quite picky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave that part to
me,” Baiwei said with a laugh. “I’ll definitely make sure you
three are satisfied.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were
amongst the most elite of Wanxiang Adepts. Yu Wei and Vastriver were
reincarnated Immortals, while Ji Ning was actually viewed by many as
a reincarnated Immortal as well; otherwise, how could his soul be so
strong? Many believed that in the past, he must have been an
extremely, extremely powerful Immortal. Precisely because of how
powerful he must have been in the past, it was now very hard to
reawaken his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was in a past life, the harder it would be to reawaken one’s
memories. For people like Immortal Juhua or Immortal Northwalker, who
were Loose Immortals but comparable to Celestial Immortals in power,
if they were to reincarnate, even after becoming Earth Immortals,
they still might not be able to reawaken their memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are the three of you
ignoring me?!?” Northson stared. Ning, Yu Wei, and Vastriver all
looked towards Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said angrily,
“Perhaps I’m not a match for you three in controlling magic
treasures, but my truly supreme, trump card constructs, were built by
myself and Master together. Although it uses up an enormous amount of
liquefied elemental essence, it is definitely comparable to a Primal
Daoist. In addition, the construct is a magic treasure, and so its
body is even more indestructible than a Fiendgod’s!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll count you
amongst our sparring ranks,” Yu Wei said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of
Constructs…some powerful constructs truly are mighty,” Adept
Vastriver nodded. “Unfortunately, the Conclave of Immortal Destiny
forbids those who train in the Dao of Constructs from participating.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why aren’t
practitioners of the Dao of Constructs permitted to attend?”
Northson said angrily, “That’s completely unfair!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “I know
the reason. It’s because I’ve never heard of a major power who
has completely mastered the Grand Dao of Constructs. Since there are
no major powers who have mastered this Dao, how can they possibly
guide you into becoming a Celestial Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was
speechless. Right. The point of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny was
to allow some major powers to discover monstrously talented geniuses
and take them as disciples. If there were no major powers who
specialized in the Dao of Constructs, they naturally wouldn’t
choose cultivators of this Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of Constructs
involved the pursuit of unleashing the physical power of material
items…to reach the utmost limit of the natural world! However, the
world was filled with countless materials and objects; to simply
review all of them would take an unfathomably long period of time. To
truly master and comprehend the Grand Dao of Constructs? Not even in
legends had anyone ever done this! Every single practitioner of the
Dao of Constructs understood this…and at the same time, they all
believed that this Grand Dao was limitless, and so they too would
become even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Vastriver, and
Northson settled down at Serpentwing Lake, while Baiwei returned.
Ning would often compete against these three or engage in discourses
on the Dao with them. This caused all of them to improve, sometimes
by a little, sometimes by a lot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day, a large boat
was floating on Serpentwing Lake. Ning and the other three were
chatting on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, what is it?” Ning noticed that Yu Wei’s
eyes were filled with unshed tears. He couldn’t help but ask her
what was wrong. Previously, when they were chatting, he had discussed
how his parents had already passed away…and somehow, this had
caused Yu Wei to appear utterly heartbroken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastriver said softly,
“Much like you, junior apprentice-sister Yu Wei’s parents are
also deceased. They died when she was young.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They died young?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tears were in Yu Wei’s
eyes…and then they began to fall. Her gaze was long and distant.
She said tonelessly, “In the past, when I was young and before I
had started to train, and before I gained any of my former
memories…my tribe suffered an attack. The tribesmen began to
flee…and during the flight, my parents died in order to protect me.
I suffered a severe shock from this, and my innately powerful soul
burst forth with power, killing all of my enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could imagine the
scene of a stimulated and shocked child, seeing her parents be
killed, and then exploding forth with spiritual power. Given how
powerful the divine will of a reincarnated Immortal was…even Zifu
Disciples would be easily slaughtered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it was too
late.” Yu Wei shook her head. “My parents were gone, never to
return. Although we had only known each other for three years, I’ll
never forget them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So Yu Wei had only been
three years old.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long vessel was
streaking through the air, moving from the distant Highwater
Commandery to Stillwater Commandery’s Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Ninelotus
wasn’t a member of the Raindragon Guard, she was unable to use
teleportation arrays. Thus, she had to fly in a straight line.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, I’m
here!” The long vessel came to a halt. A snowy-robed Ninelotus flew
out. With a wave of her hand, she collected the vessel, then stared
towards the distance. She immediately saw the boat on the surface of
Serpentwing Lake, as well as Ji Ning, Mu Northson, Rainbowflame Fairy
Yu Wei, and Adept Vastriver, all of whom were drinking and chatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei and senior apprentice-brother Vastriver?”
Ninelotus was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
three, on the boat below, could sense the ripples in the air. They
all raised their heads to look up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing Ninelotus
in midair, Ning revealed a look of surprise and delight. He
immediately rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and the others
rose up as well. Yu Wei and Ninelotus were extremely close to each
other, and she immediately called out in a high voice, “Little
Sister Ninelotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus descended
from the skies, landing on the ship. First, she exchanged a glance
with Ning. A hint of emotion could be seen in both their eyes. And
then, Ninelotus turned to look at Yu Wei. She said happily, “Senior
apprentice-sister, I didn’t expect to see you here as well. It’s
been so long since we’ve met. Oh, and senior apprentice-brother
Vastriver and junior apprentice-brother Northson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been a long
time since I’ve seen you as well. It’s been ten years, right?”
Yu Wei felt very happy. “Why did you disappear for ten years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t even want
to talk about it.” Ninelotus shook her head helplessly. “I was
held by the tribe in the Myriad Lotuses Cave and wasn’t able to
leave, up until a few days ago, when I managed to break through the
formation around it. I flew all the way from Highwater Commandery to
Stillwater Commandery. It took me forever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given your status,
why would the clan hold you in the Myriad Lotuses Cavern?” Yu Wei
was surprised. It could be said that she was Ninelotus’ closest
friend in the Black-White College; although Luo Qing was someone who
had grown up with Ninelotus, Yu Wei and Ninelotus truly shared the
same temperament and opinions. Thus, Yu Wei knew a few things about
Ninelotus’ background.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus gave Ning a
resigned glance. “It’s all because of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” Yu Wei felt
as though Ninelotus’ glance was a bit…strange. It didn’t seem
like a glance between fellow disciples; rather, it seemed like a
glance between Dao-Companions, whose emotions and feelings were
linked together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked over,
taking Ninelotus by the hand. He didn’t know what to say. After
hesitating for a while, he only said three words: “Are you
alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine…it was
just a bit stuffy there. Still, now that I’m out, in the future,
the Dongyan clan won’t interfere in our matters again.” Ninelotus
looked at Ning, her eyes filled with delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t interfere?”
Ning couldn’t help but reveal a look of delight as well. The
Dongyan clan’s interference had always been a source of worry for
Ning. Now, everything was fine, and his worries dissipated like smoke
in the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of them…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ning
and Ninelotus. She couldn’t help but feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had no idea…that
the two of them became Dao-Companions!” Adept Vastriver began to
roar with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you actually formed Dao-Companions
without telling me?!” Northson roared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Yu Wei, she just
stood there quietly, keeping that calm, faint smile on her face.
