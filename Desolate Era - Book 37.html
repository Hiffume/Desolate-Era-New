<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fate
had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Avatar</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ji Ning began to head towards the Jadefire Realm of the Terror
Starsea, his avatar sent word to Ninedust via the Palace of Ancient
Truth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust,
you are in the Jadefire Realm? I’m on my way.” This was the
simple message which Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Palace of Ancient Truth had branches within all eight of the Sacred
Cities of the Dao Alliance, and the mighty Ancients were the power
behind it. Ning’s words quickly made its way to the Ancients and
thus to Ninedust’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ninedust was shocked. He never would’ve imagined that Darknorth
would find out that he had entered the Jadefire Realm. In his heart,
he couldn’t help but feel gratitude; everyone knew that the place
was a deathtrap! Darknorth knew it as well, but he still rushed
towards it without hesitating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
I’ve been chased by Archon Silksnow into the Jadefire Realm but I
never made that information public. If you’ve found out… that
means it must be Archon Silksnow who spread the news. This is his
plot!” Ninedust sent word back to Ning as well. “No matter what,
don’t come here. Archon Silksnow is a madman. This is definitely a
plot aimed at you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
message made it back to Ning’s avatar in Vastheaven Palace… but
alas, it was of no use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh,
Darknorth is so…” Ninedust knew that he wouldn’t be able to
dissuade Ning, and so his avatar within the Ancient stronghold
immediately headed off to Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
man dressed in fluttering gray robes emerged from a tear in space,
then stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
I am.” The gray-robed man looked weatherworn, with anxiety written
on his face. “I hope I made it in time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
gray-robed man waved his hand, causing countless drops of rain to
appear in the air. The rain sprinkled down upon every inch of
Vastheaven Palace, but the power within the rain was completely
blocked by the barriers protecting the palace itself. The blocked
power generated ripples which immediately attracted the interest of
Emperor Solesky and Ji Ning’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Both emerged from the barriers, standing shoulder-to-shoulder as they
stared off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ha.”
Ning’s avatar grinned. “You can head on back, big brother
Solesky. Let me have a chat with my old friend.” Ning’s avatar
then strode into the skies towards the gray-robed man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Solesky smiled as well. He was also able to recognize who it was, as
the gray-robed man had discarded his disguise and revealed his true
appearance. It was indeed the Ninedust Sectlord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust.”
Ning’s avatar walked over to stand next to the gray-robed man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Ninedust looked at Ning, his feelings rather mixed. Although he
didn’t wish for Ning to know that he was in great danger, he also
felt very grateful for the way in which Ning had reacted upon finding
out. This was what true brothers were like!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not too late, am I?” Ninedust asked. “Your true body hasn’t
entered the Jadefire Realm yet, has it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
even close. I need to be careful when traversing the Terror Starsea.
I can’t just blink about willy-nilly like here in the Flamedragon
Realmverse,” Ning said with a smile. “It’ll take me at least
another thousand years or so before I make it there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
let out a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness… eh?” Ninedust peered
at Ning intently, rather surprised. “Why do I feel as though your
aura has changed a bit?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
both were merely avatars, their auras were generated by their
truesouls and their Daos. An evil cultivator’s very aura would
become evil and malicious! Since the true body and the avatar were
linked together and analogous, the aura of Ning’s avatar had indeed
changed and become more powerful since last they met.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the past, Ning was reserved and stately, like a blade that would
reveal its sharpness when unleashed. Now, however, he seemed as vast
and ineffable as the starry sky, but also as gentle as a drop of
water. One couldn’t help but like him upon seeing him. He possessed
a certain deep magnetism.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was caused by an illusory art I created,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusory
art?” Ninedust was surprised. “You’ve already reached such
profound heights in the Dao of the Sword. How is it that an illusory
art could have changed you this much?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
one focused on illusions, one would generally gain tremendous
charisma. Su Youji was a classic example of this. Ordinary
cultivators who saw Su Youji would be uncontrollably intoxicated by
her to the point of willingly following her as her servant. For those
who had reached incredible heights in the art of illusions, their
natural auras alone could seduce others without them even actively
trying to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
[Unfettered Dreamlands] technique was an illusory art Ning had spent
over half a chaos cycle working on. He had created it with the
assistance of the Autarch’s stone dais after he had delved into the
many mysteries of the countless techniques he had studied. For it to
have affected him was only normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was focusing on illusions recently and managed to make some
progress.” Ning smiled smugly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
Enough about your illusions.” Ninedust immediately said, “I came
over here at full speed because I want you to avoid entering the
Jadefire Realm. You already know that this is Archon Silksnow’s
plot; why must you fall into it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “Plot? What sort of plot could he possibly have?
Ninedust, why don’t you tell me what you think he can be plotting?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
underestimate him. He’s crazy.” Ninedust revealed an anxious
look. “I was chased by him through the Terror Starsea. I fled in
panic and used up pretty much all of my treasures. When we moved past
the Jadefire Realm, I gritted my teeth and dove into it to save my
own skin.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. Faced with certain death, it only made sense that
Ninedust had jumped into a deathtrap. At least that way, he had a
chance, no matter how tiny. If he didn’t, he would be doomed once
Archon Silksnow caught up to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
thought that once I dove into it, he would be afraid to follow me
inside.” Ninedust shook his head. “I was wrong. That madman
actually charged in right behind me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning narrowed his eyes. “He went in as well? Does he have a
death-wish?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why I said he’s crazy!” Ninedust said seriously, “The Jadefire
Realm is a deathtrap which the Sithe set up during the Dawn War. Even
though we beat them in the end, many of our major powers died in it
during the war! Even though I charged inside, if I’m careful and
take my time, I should still have a chance to find an escape path and
be able to leave it… but now that Archon Silksnow has charged
inside as well, I’m forced to continue my headlong flight. I’m
being forced to straight for the more dangerous-looking places inside
the Jadefire Realm… but he’s still chasing me! In the end, I
ended up being trapped in a place that looks like some sort of
prison.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Prison?”
Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not too sure myself. All I know is that I’m trapped within a small
area of just thirty or so meters.” Ninedust sighed. “Thankfully,
there’s no danger inside the cell for now… and Archon Silksnow
didn’t dare to continue his pursuit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
prison-like place, eh?” Ning frowned pensively. He was a member of
the Brightshore Kingdom, after all; he had immediately set off to
acquire a map of the Terror Starsea from the Brightshore Hegemon. He
was planning to use treasures to trade for it, but Hegemon
Brightshore had just given it for free. He now had maps from both the
Hegemon and Daoist Bluestone, and as a result, he knew a bit about
the Jadefire Realm. The Jadefire Realm was a deathtrap the Sithe had
set up… and at its very center lay the prisons!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Quite
a few major powers of the cultivator civilizations had been trapped
within the Jadefire Realm. Many of them were unable to escape! Once
the Sithe had trapped enough major powers, they would unleash a
single ‘Decimatus Wave’ and annihilate all of the prisoners!
Hegemon Brightshore’s records stated it thusly:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Jadefire Realm’s prisons are primarily spread across seven regions,
and there are differences in them based on importance. However, the
Sithe are all dead. I once scanned them from afar and found no signs
of life within them… but the place is still filled with countless
dangers. Although the Jadefire Realm has been badly damaged,
rendering its apocalypse wave unusable, there are still many
formations and barriers that are strong enough to cause even Hegemons
to die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
prisons?” Ning frowned. “Damn that Silksnow!” Even the ordinary
prisons within the Jadefire Realm were incredibly dangerous places!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, I’m fine for now,” Ninedust said hurriedly. “I’m
merely restricted to a thirty-meter region. So long as I don’t
touch any of the barriers, I won’t be in any danger.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
you are still in one of the Jadefire Realm’s prisons!” Ning was
worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why you need to stay away, Darknorth.” Ninedust said hurriedly,
“Archon Silksnow was crazy enough to charge in because he wants to
use it to get rid of the two of us. He’s cast all caution to the
wind. He’s already been inside for quite some time; by now, he
probably knows quite a bit about that place. He has probably prepared
traps for you! Once you go there, you’ll be in a new and foreign
place. It’ll be easy for him to trick you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
no fool,” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
he has the advantage!” Ninedust argued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I’m not completely ignorant of the Jadefire Realm.” Ning
shook his head. He had star maps from Daoist Bluestone and Hegemon
Brightshore. As a result, he was quite familiar with the Jadefire
Realm by now. “And… I’ve been wanting to get rid of him for
some time now. If we just let that vile madman do as he pleases, he
might end up causing some real trouble in the future. Best to get rid
of him soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
Ninedust was extremely anxious. “How can you…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
not like you don’t know what sort of temper I have.” Ning
grinned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
knew I wouldn’t be able to dissuade you, but I still had to try.”
Ninedust felt quite resigned. “Ugh. After all that talking, I still
wasn’t able to budge you in the slightest! No matter what, safety
first!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not a hot-headed kid anymore,” Ning said with a laugh. “The only
way I’ll be able to save you is if I keep myself alive.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_002__Flam"></A>
Chapter 2: Unexpected Surprise</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
had failed to dissuade Ji Ning, but he decided to temporarily reside
within Vastheaven Palace. That way, he would be able to keep in
constant contact with Ning and be able to report details regarding
his situation. This would be helpful to Ning in Ning’s efforts to
rescue him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Terror Starsea. Ning’s true body was hastening through the
region, his Protector in tow. This place was far too dangerous; even
Ning had to advance through it with great caution. After roughly
eight hundred years, the two finally made it to the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
arrived.” Ning stared off into the front at the enormous,
nigh-infinite vortex of fire which had appeared in the void. The
flame vortex took up an enormous amount of territory. Each petal of
fire was very beautiful, but filled with tremendous danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Whitethaw’s eyes suddenly lit up and he spoke out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes?”
Ning glanced at Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been here before,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
been here before?” Ning was delighted. He suddenly remembered that
Daoist Bluestone had acquired this Sithe Protector in the Terror
Starsea! Whitethaw had been charged with protecting an extremely
high-status Sithe, which in turn meant it wasn’t that surprising
for them to have visited the Jadefire Realm before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Whitethaw nodded. “My original Sithe master was invited here
before. This place which you cultivators call the ‘Jadefire Realm’
was known to the Sithe as the ‘Seven Flaming Hells’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
else do you know?” Ning was overjoyed. This truly was an unexpected
surprise. The more he learned about the Jadefire Realm, the easier
his visit to it would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
held nothing back from his new master: “This is a deathtrap which
the Sithe laboriously built up. My master was merely invited here to
view it, and so I only have a cursory knowledge of it! The heart of
the Seven Flaming Hells are the seven core prisons within it. Those
seven prisons are paramount, but there are a large number of ordinary
cells as well! All of them, together, form the ‘Seven Flamehell
Annihilation Formation’ which can generate a type of destructive
black flames. Aside from Autarchs, virtually anyone touched by these
destructive black flames will perish.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was in awe as he nodded slowly. “Those black flames… we
cultivators refered to them as a wave of ‘Decimatus Flames’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
the Sithe ended up being defeated in the war. That means the Seven
Flaming Hells were probably attacked and destroyed, along with its
formation,” Whitethaw said. “Thus, Master, there’s no need for
you to worry about the Decimatus Flames.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
listened as Whitethaw continued: “Part of those prisons are
damaged, but part are probably intact. If you wish to save your
friend, Master, you must first find out where he is. If he’s
trapped in a damaged prison, you’ll have a chance to rescue him!
But if he is within an intact prison… rescuing him will be very,
very difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
addition, your enemy ‘Archon Silksnow’ is also present. Based on
what you said, Master, he’s not inside the prisons. There are a
large number of passageways outside the prisons,” Whitethaw said.
“These many passageways are filled with many traps and barriers.
The Sithe once controlled them to ensure that cultivators were unable
to escape. Many died in those passageways or were blasted into a
prison during the battles. My guess is that Archon Silksnow is
definitely planning to use those mechanisms to trap you, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Passageways?
Prisons?” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
my original Sithe master was invited to come here, the receiving
Sithe warned him never to fly within the passageways! He was only to
walk on the ground. That way, even if he did run into some of the
barriers, at least he wouldn’t be sent into the prisons.”
Whitethaw smiled. “No matter how dangerous the situation on the
ground might seem, he was not to fly at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
ground is filled with many dangerous barriers and formations, but
they aren’t capable of killing Hegemons. It is precisely because of
how dangerous the ground looks that many cultivators choose to fly
instead, seeking to avoid those dangers.” Whitethaw continued, “But
while it is true that you will encounter much fewer dangers while
flying… the ones that you will encounter are lethally dangerous
ones! Even Hegemons might perish.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. If it hadn’t been for Whitethaw telling him this,
Ning would never have been able to guess at all of these secrets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have to be careful, Master. I’ve only been to this place once with
my original Sithe master before,” Whitethaw said, “And I’m only
familiar with a few of the passageways which my Sithe master once
took. As for the more important secrets of the prisons, I wasn’t
privy to those.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
told me enough. This is excellent.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
when the Jadefire Realm was in perfect shape, so long as one walked
without flying one wouldn’t encounter any dangers which could
threaten Hegemons! Now that the Jadefire Realm was in bad shape,
things would be even safer. Neither Archon Silksnow nor the Ninedust
Sectlord had died in the passageways, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Silksnow, so long as you stay outside the prisons, you won’t be
able to threaten me no matter how you plot.” Ning felt much more
relaxed, and a cold light flashed through his eyes. “I’m not
going to die here, but you are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go inside, Whitethaw,” Ning said. Whoosh. The two of them
immediately flew into that enormous vortex of fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
enormous vortex of fire was pitch-black inside. After Ning and
Whitethaw entered, they felt as though they had entered a completely
different world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning saw clusters of fiery passageways up ahead. The countless fiery
passageways were all interlinked, almost like an enormous beehive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War, this had been a Sithe base. The Sithe would be able to
retreat here and recuperate in safety… but the cultivators who
dared barge inside would all perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can sense them.” Ning stared towards a certain direction, then
reached out with his right hand and pointed. “Silksnow is right
over there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
these passageways are all interlinked. You’ll be able to reach any
prison from any passage,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
that’s the case, then we’ll choose that passageway.” Ning began
to fly towards the passageway up ahead, the one which he felt would
lead him towards Archon Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
here?” A skinny, white-haired, white-browed man was seated in the
lotus position within an empty space that was merely three hundred
meters in size. Archon Silksnow was able to sense that his realmship
was resonating with a realmship part. A look of excitement flashed
through his oily green eyes: “Daolord Darknorth actually came. Heh
heh… they really are good friends.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he felt that Ning would probably come, this place was still the
Jadefire Realm. Not everyone would be willing to brave such great
danger for the sake of a friend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.
Daolord Darknorth… I might not be able to beat you, but the Sithe
can.” Archon Silksnow stared towards the flames, a smile playing on
his lips. “I’ll wait for you right here. Let’s see what you can
do. I’m completely surrounded by lethal traps. So long as you come
towards me, you’ll definitely activate them. Once you do, you are
dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
destruction of the Sithe had resulted in many of the barriers and
mechanisms being revealed. There was no longer anyone in charge of
them, which was why they could no longer remain hidden!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had chosen this region because there was a terrifyingly
strong formation here. It was so mighty that just staring at it would
cause one to shudder. Archon Silksnow knew that if he touched it, he
would instantly perish! Thus, he carefully skirted the formation and
then hid himself within the void besides it. He then set up a few
formations of his own to help mask and disguise the truly dangerous
one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already disguised the trap. There’s no way you’ll notice it at
all.” Archon Silksnow revealed a smile. “You’ll definitely
touch it… and even if you don’t, I’ll arrange for you to do
so.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
knew that someone like Ning would definitely be quite crafty. It
wouldn’t be easy to trick him, and so he had made many plans to
ensure that Ning would fall into at least one of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
advantage lay in the fact that he had been the first to enter the
Jadefire Realm!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh.
You want to save your friend, eh? Heh heh heh… you are dead. Dead!”
Archon Silksnow eagerly awaited Ning’s arrival. It had been a long,
long time since he had felt this excited! The most dazzling Daolord
in all of history was coming, someone who had destroyed the Silksnow
Fiend Palace… and today, Archon Silksnow was finally going to get
rid of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning flew into the passageway, then stepped onto the ground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Master. As you follow the passageway, you’ll run into a
fairly high number of barriers and traps.” Whitethaw was by Ning’s
side, protecting him at all times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. Ning began to carefully advance through the twisting,
flaming passageways. The passageways were a thousand meters in
diameter, and a number of mechanisms were clearly visible within
them. Ning and Whitethaw were able to easily avoid touching them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
walking for the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, Ning suddenly
blinked. He then glanced at the nearby Whitethaw. “Whitethaw,
didn’t you say there were plenty of dangers and mechanisms here?”
They hadn’t encountered anything dangerous at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Uh…”
Whitethaw felt rather awkward. “I guess… maybe the Sithe are all
dead and no one is in control… which is why there are no dangers?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh.”
Ning laughed when he saw the awkward look on Whitethaw’s face.
“Alright, let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two of them continued to traverse the passageways with ease, moving
closer and closer towards Archon Silksnow.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_003__Flam"></A>
Chapter 3: Ji Ning and Silksnow</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
winding, flaming corridors stretched off for countless kilometers.
They had been nightmares for cultivators during the Dawn War, but now
that they were damaged and were no longer actively controlled, the
barriers within had been dramatically lessened in number.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
flames beneath the feet of Ji Ning and Whitethaw suddenly transformed
to form a giant flaming head that was three hundred meters long. The
flaming head opened its great mouth, preparing to swallow Ning and
Whitethaw whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Whitethaw stomped down angrily towards the ground with his white,
fur-covered feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The furry stomp delivered a strike of inconceivable power, instantly
crushing the flames below and shattering the flaming head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled when he saw this: “We finally encountered a trap. This was
the first one for us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Master. Leave these mechanisms to me,” Whitethaw boomed
sonorously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’m not worried at all.” Ning laughed, but he couldn’t help but
sigh secretly in amazement as well. No wonder the highest-ranking
Sithe had all wanted Sithe Protectors like this. Whitethaw was
definitely comparable to supreme Archons in power! Even when Ning
fought against it with all his might, Ning was still unable to gain
any advantage at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
this wasn’t the most impressive thing about it. What was really
impressive was the fact that the golem was meant to protect and
defend. In raw power alone, it was comparable to Hegemons in might!
This was the reason why Ning wasn’t able to gain any advantage even
when using his Heavenbreaker stance with all his power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aside
from possessing overwhelming power, it was also capable of soft and
flexible attacks. It was capable of tying down any foe, even
Hegemon-level ones. It could also stand in front of its master,
helping its master face any dangers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be understood that not even an actual Hegemon would necessarily
be as effective as a Sithe Protector when it came to actually
guarding someone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Whitethaw continued to follow the passageway. Whitethaw used his
absolute, overwhelming power to block and crush any of the traps they
activated. In truth, these mechanisms weren’t all that powerful;
they weren’t even able to force Whitethaw to enter his ‘flexible’
mode.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Countless flames suddenly sprang up beneath Ning’s feet,
surrounding him from every direction and from above him as well.
Flames were spinning everywhere, almost as though they had just been
trapped in a cage of flames. The spinning flames came together to
form a strange script which was clearly accumulating a surge of
terrifying power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face tightened slightly. This was the first time since entering this
place that he felt a bit of danger. Clang! Ning pulled a pair of
Northbow swords from the sheath on his back, bringing them to the
ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
leave it to me!” Whitethaw let out a low roar, slamming his giant
furry palms in every direction in a series of furious strikes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! It was like a wave of palm-strikes striking out
everywhere. Each palm was actually slightly stronger than even Ning’s
full-force Heavenbreaker stance! More than ten palm-strikes were
unleashed in the blink of an eye, causing the cage of flames to start
to crack and crumble. Moments later, the cage exploded violently and
then completely collapsed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Protector lowered his hands, a stolid and straightforward look on his
face as always.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Pretty
impressive.” Ning was beginning to like the golem more and more.
When Daoist Bluestone had traded this golem to him as part of the
deal for the Omega Sword Dao, Bluestone had said that these Sithe
Protector golems were extremely rare and of slight interest to even
Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
probably have to rely on Whitethaw if I want to rescue Ninedust,”
Ning mused to himself. “It is much better at facing danger than I
am, after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
they continued to advance from one fiery passageway into another,
Ning could sense that he was gradually growing closer to Archon
Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Six
days passed in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almost
there.” Ning turned solemn. Although he had the absolute advantage
in power, Archon Silksnow had proven his determination when he had
chosen to risk his life and enter the Jadefire Realm. Ning wouldn’t
be the slightest bit over-confident against such a crazy foe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
watched carefully as he continued to walk forwards. “Over there!”
Ning’s eyes narrowed as he saw the man. A few hundred million
kilometers away, a skinny white-robed, white-browed man was seated in
the lotus position in a tiny empty space that was surrounded by
flames. His oily-green eyes were fixed upon Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
flames and other things were between them, to experts like them mere
matter was unable to block their line of sight. Previously, they were
unable to see each other because they were too far away and too many
mechanisms were present. Now that they were less than a billion
kilometers away from each other, they were able to see each other
clearly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,”
Ning said as he walked forwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
really do admire you.” A gravelly voice rang out in the area around
Ning: “You threw yourself into the Terror Starsea and then into the
Jadefire Realm, all for the sake of just a single friend! Daolord
Darknorth, I already admired you for your strength. Now, I admire you
for your courage as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
admire you greatly as well. You are an Eternal Emperor, but you were
willing to risk it all in diving into this deathtrap. If I chose not
to come, it is possible that the end result would be that you and
Ninedust would both die in here,” Ning said. “For an Eternal
Emperor to be willing to enter into a suicide pact with a Daolord…
I’m truly awed by your madness.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Entering
the Jadefire Realm was easy. Leaving was difficult! In the past the
Sithe had allowed countless cultivators to enter without impeding
them, then killed them once they were inside! Thus, although Archon
Silksnow had been able to survive his entrance, actually leaving
alive would be a thousand times more difficult. It wouldn’t be
possible to simply take the original route back, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Suicide
pact? You underestimate me too much,” Archon Silksnow said with a
cold smile. He had a realmship, meaning that he was much better at
staying alive than other Archons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
drew me here for the sake of trapping me, yes?” Ning continued to
walk forwards, a smile on his lips. “You aren’t strong enough to
do it yourself. Your plan is probably to use some of the terrifying
mechanisms within the Jadefire Realm to do it yourself. If my guess
is correct, you should be surrounded by incredibly terrifying traps.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Indeed.
I’m surrounded by terrifying traps. Tens of them. Hundreds of
them!” Archon Silksnow laughed wildly, “And that’s why you
should stay far, far away from me. The closer you get to me, the
sooner your death will come.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two continued to speak from a great distance, while Archon Silksnow
concealed his true thoughts and his true plan against Ning. Closer,
closer… just a little bit closer… Archon Silksnow eagerly awaited
Ning’s arrival. He knew that given how proud Daolord Darknorth was,
there was no way he would flee without even seeing the traps.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had his schemes, but Ning had plans of his own. If Whitethaw
hadn’t told him some of the secrets of this place, Ning would be
proceeding with much greater caution. Now, however, Ning knew that so
long as he didn’t fly into the air he wouldn’t be attacked by any
of the truly deadly mechanisms of this place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,
in the end your schemes will all amount to nothing,” Ning mused.
However, he still instructed Whitethaw cautiously, “Whitethaw, stay
ahead of me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Acknowledged.”
Whitethaw led the way, while Ning followed Whitethaw from behind. He
was being cautious for the added security it would provide, but also
for the sake of lulling Archon Silksnow into a sense of complacency.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distance between the two began to shrink. Eighty million kilometers.
Sixty million kilometers. Fifty million kilometers. Thirty million
kilometers…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
closer, the better. That way, Daolord Darknorth will suffer even
greater repercussions from the shockwave.” Archon Silksnow felt his
formerly-calm heartrate begin to pick up, hammering against his chest
like meteors. “Closer…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
million kilometers. Eight million kilometers. Five million
kilometers…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
Why isn’t he attacking me yet? Hurry up and attack!” Archon
Silksnow waited eagerly. “Once he attacks, he’ll definitely hit
the barrier in front of me.” If Ning didn’t attack, he would have
to come up with a way to trick him into touching the barrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distance between the two had shrunken down to merely a million
kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Suddenly a wave of invisible heartforce swept out, instantly passing
the distance between them and falling upon the white-browed Archon
Silksnow. This was the [Unfettered Dreamlands], and a beautiful
dream-world appeared before his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
finally invincible! Hahaha… I’m the ruler of this realmverse!
Hahahah!” Archon Silksnow was seated upon a throne. Below him were
Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, and the
other major powers. They were all waiting on him subserviently,
causing him to laugh with delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
a moment later a look of terror appeared in his eyes. He realized
that he had been trapped inside an illusion!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break! Break!” He furiously struggled mentally, but he could sense
the world around him clinging onto his mind like mud, making it hard
for him to escape. He continued to struggle, and finally with a ‘pop’
he managed to break through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had shaken free from the [Unfettered Dreamlands], regaining his
mental clarity and control over his body.</P>

Chapter 4: Eruption</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Capture
him.” As soon as Ji Ning had unleashed his heartforce illusions, he
had ordered the Sithe Protector to advance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
it.” Whitethaw transformed into a streak of light, running through
the flaming passageway at high speed. They were less than a million
kilometers away, an extremely short distance to the likes of them.
Whitethaw had almost instantly charged over to Archon Silksnow, his
feet still firmly planted on the ground. He hadn’t flown a single
time! He reached out with his great furry right hand, clawing towards
Archon Silksnow. But right as he did so…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
The blurry-eyed Archon Silksnow suddenly vanished into thin air, a
strange vessel appearing in his place. This was an ancient and
unadorned vessel, covered with specks of rust and decay that spoke to
its great age as well as the tremendous damage it had suffered.
Despite that, it was still able to move at incredible speeds. It
instantly retreated at high speeds, avoiding Whitethaw’s strike
with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s face tightened. He could sense that when Whitethaw had
reached out, Archon Silksnow had still been trapped by the illusions.
“Is there someone else here besides Silksnow?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Inside
the fleeing realmship were two figures. The two figures looked
absolutely identical; both were white-haired, white-browed copies of
Archon Silksnow. One of them had a lost look on his eyes, while the
other was quite clear-headed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Erupt!”
the clear-minded Archon Silksnow commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Archon Silksnow had long ago set up a masking formation to hide the
terrifying trap present, as well as a few other simple formations
that would be able to activate the trap. Now that Archon Silksnow
actively chose to detonate his formations, they instantly erupted
with their full fury! The powerful detonations instantly smashed
against the truly deadly trap, causing an absolutely enormous
eruption of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a terrifying burst of destructive power instantly sprayed out in
every direction like a dark-red wave of flames. Everything it touched
was evaporated, including even spacetime and karma itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Archon Silksnow had first fled in his realmship before detonating the
attack, the dark-red flames almost instantly crossed the ten million
kilometers of distance and smashed against the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Not even the realmship was able to continue to fly steadily, with the
force of the blast sending it tumbling. As a vessel meant for flying
between realmverses, it was extremely valuable and generally only
owned by extremely high-ranking Sithe. When Autarch Bolin had
assaulted the Stone Hellephant Wall, only two of the many Sithe there
had been in possession of realmships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin had taken one away, while the other had been destroyed in the
fighting. However, only Autarchs were capable of destroying
realmships with ease. They were built to be extremely sturdy. Thus,
even though the realmship was hit with a terrifying amount of power
and was sent careening through the air, it remained undamaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Ning sensed that terrifying wave of destructive power wash
out towards him from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away. The
dark-red wave of flames instantly swept through the area with such
power that even Ning shuddered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
wave of power was enough to cause even Hegemons to perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!”
Whitethaw immediately began to run towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as Ning was about to defend against it, he noticed something odd. He
immediately sent mentally to the Protector, “Don’t panic. It
can’t hurt me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
massive, dark-red wave of fiery power blasted out in every direction…
but it maintained a distance of roughly thirty meters from the
ground. Although it blew straight past Ning, it merely swept past him
and the ground of the passageway. This region of thirty meters above
the ground was completely safe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Northbow
swords at the ready, Ning raised his head to stare at the dark-red
wave of flames as it swept through the skies above him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it’s true. As long as I continue to simply walk on the ground, I’ll
be perfectly safe.” Ning grinned. “The Sithe were probably
worried about misfires, as these traps don’t differentiate between
friend or foe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!”
Whitehaw arrived next to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let’s go find Archon Silksnow. Don’t let him escape,” Ning
barked. Swoosh! Swoosh! The two continued to run forwards across the
surface of ground. Soon, they were able to see the distant realmship
bathed in those dark-red flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What!?
That vessel remains undamaged despite suffering an attack of that
magnitude?” Ning revealed a puzzled look. He carefully inspected
the vessel, examining what it was made out of. It seemed to be quite
similar to his own realmship part, and the resonance was coming from
that direction as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Could
it be an actual realmship? Did Archon Silksnow have an undamaged
realmship!? Ning was rather stunned by the implications. Both he and
Ninedust knew that Archon Silksnow probably had realmship parts of
his own, as that was the only explanation for the resonance, but
neither of them had even dared to imagine that the Archon might have
an actual realmship part! The thing looked damaged, but it was at
least serviceable. The price of the realmship was truly incalculable!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
that’s a realmship! I’ve seen them before. My master wanted one,
but he couldn’t afford it,” Whitethaw sent mentally. “One
realmship is worth twenty of me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was no joke. Whitethaw didn’t have to explain why realmships were
so valuable! It must be remembered that it was extremely difficult
and time-consuming for even Hegemons to travel between realmverses.
Realmships, however, made the passage extremely easy and simple. Any
Hegemon would be willing to pay almost any price to acquire a
realmship. In fact, four or five Hegemons would be willing to join
together into a consortium to buy a realmship! In reality, however,
they were never for sale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift was willing to be generous enough to offer the Crimsonwave
Temple to his homeland, but he would never have been willing to hand
over a realmship. Only Autarchs were wealthy enough to give those
things away!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow
actually has a realmship!” Ning’s eyes turned bloodshot with
excitement. “I have to get it! I have to!” Ning had originally
simply been wanting to get rid of a potential future threat, but now
he felt great desire for the realmship as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship was sent spinning through the air by the dark-red flames,
but it quickly managed to stabilize. The two bodies Archon Silksnow
were both on their feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t expect that Daolord Darknorth’s illusions would’ve
reached such a level of power. Not even my avatar was able to resist
it. It took a full second before it woke up. Even my true body was
trapped for an instant!” Archon Silksnow glanced at his avatar.
“How terrifying. Daolord Darknorth is improving at a terrifying
pace.” His oily green eyes flashed with cold light. “I have to
kill him right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately…
things went to hell. My plans were completely wrecked.” Archon
Silksnow shook his head. His plan had been to let his avatar wait
there by itself, while his true body was aboard the realmship and
hiding within an estate-treasure carried by the avatar. He wanted to
use his avatar to lure Ning in, while his true body lay in wait.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t expect that Ning would immediately use illusions to attack.
When the illusions struck, both his avatar and his true body were
simultaneously trapped by it! Generally speaking, if a true body was
trapped by an illusion the avatar would be trapped as well. This was
because avatars were weaker to illusions than true bodies were!
However, the reverse wasn’t necessarily the case.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this situation, the avatar had taken a full second before regaining
consciousness. Archon Silksnow’s true body, however, had almost
instantly woken up after briefly falling for the illusions. By the
time Whitethaw had reached out to grab the avatar, Archon Silksnow’s
true body immediately made his move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
one thought had been in Archon Silksnow’s mind at that time: “I
absolutely cannot fight Darknorth in close combat. If I do and he
traps me in his illusions, even for a heartbeat, I’ll suffer a
heavy wound or even die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Screw
it. I’ll set the blast off now.” Archon Silksnow no longer dared
to try any other tricks. He was terrified of Ning’s illusions, and
so he immediately detonated the nearby trap. Given how powerful that
trap was and the fact that Ning was just a few hundred thousand
kilometers away, he felt that it was very likely it would be able to
kill Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
dead, right? He has to be dead.” Archon Silksnow put away his
avatar and then took control over the realmship as he turned to
carefully scrutinize the area he had just fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
two figures appeared. One was a youth carrying a sheath on his back,
the other was a furry white creature. These two were moving in
pursuit of the realmship at terrifying speeds on the ground, the
flames just overhead above them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?!” Archon Silksnow was shocked. “He didn’t die?!”
The Archon didn’t understand it. He managed to survive the blast
because of his realmship, but how did Daolord Darknorth survive? Even
top-grade Eternal treasures would’ve been instantly shattered by
such a blast. Even Hegemons would’ve perished!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee.”
This was the only thought in Archon Silksnow’s mind. He immediately
controlled his realmship and sent it into a headlong flight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,
don’t run!” Ning let out a furious shout when he saw the
realmship begin to accelerate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Silksnow didn’t dare to let Ning get close to him. The
illusory art Ning had used had truly frightened him, and he was
completely focused on using the realmship to throw Ning off his
track.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_005__Flam"></A>
Chapter 5: Foreordained Results</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chase
him down!” Ji Ning and his Whitethaw both transformed into streaks
of light, chasing at high speed while staying on the ground-level of
the flaming tunnels. However, the escaping realmship was moving
farther and farther away from them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
too fast. The realmship is able to fly much faster than we can.”
Ning stared off into the distance, his face tense as he continued the
pursuit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Master. The passageways are filled with traps and mechanisms.
If he moves slowly and carefully he can avoid some of them, but he’s
flying like a madman! He covers a hundred million kilometers in an
instant without even looking at what’s up ahead. He’ll definitely
run into some of them. Once they activate, they’ll slow him down if
not kill him outright,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. They were supposed to travel through a dangerous place like
this with caution. The only reason why Ning dared to run forward at
full speed was because Whitethaw was blocking for him up ahead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon
Silksnow is protected by the realmship. That’s why he dares to fly
about like a madman,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, a blast of power burst out from up ahead. Ning saw that a
region of ten thousand kilometers up ahead had been trapped within a
spatial vortex. The rippling spatial vortex manifested circles of
light that howled through the area and chopped through everything
within it. Each circle of light was like an incredibly sharp buzzsaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
howling buzzsaws of light turned that entire region of ten thousand
kilometers into a deathtrap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
The distant Archon Silksnow noticed what had happened behind him. He
instantly felt a great sense of delight: “Die! Die! The only reason
why I dare to move so fast is because I’m in a realmship. How dare
the two of them chase that quickly? They tripped a trap, eh? A pity
that only the golem fell into that trap. It’d be perfect if Daolord
Darknorth fell in as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAR!”
Faced with all those buzzsaws of light, Whitethaw raised his head and
let out a furious bellow. He then lifted his fists up high, them
brought them smashing down towards the ground with his full power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The rippling region of space began to shudder after receiving this
titanic strike. As the space began to crumble, even the buzzsaws of
light began to vanish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
The fleeing Archon Silksnow was unable to accept this. “Even his
golem is that powerful?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
led the way and Ning followed from behind. Whitethaw was able to
attack with both dominating power as well as supreme flexibility.
Even Hegemons would envy his physical gifts! He was simply incredibly
good at staying alive. This was why he had survived even though his
original Sithe master had perished. Although he was perhaps inferior
in terms of power and attacking techniques when compared to Black
Emperors, he was even tougher and more resilient than them. This was
why the Sithe named these types of golems ‘Protector’ golems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Whitethaw barreled through one barrier after another, and
none of the eight he rammed through were able to do anything to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BANG!
Suddenly, a loud explosion rang out from afar as a jade-green burst
of light erupted. It was like dazzling jade moonlight, filled with
satin-like gentleness. When the fleeing realmship rammed into into
the jade-green light, the power of the jade moonlight was fully
released. The jadeship was instantly smashed backwards and sent
tumbling through the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
more like it. We already ran into eight of those things. How could
you run into none while flying through the air?” Ning was delighted
upon seeing this. “The most dangerous traps the Sithe created were
all placed in the skies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship continued to careen backwards through the air. The traps in
the air truly were incredibly powerful. “W-what the hell was…”
As the realmship was smashed backwards, Archon Silksnow was briefly
dizzied by the force of the collision as well. After recovering, he
hurriedly took control of the realmship once more to continue his
flight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
catching up.” Archon Silksnow couldn’t help but frown when he saw
the two figures chasing after him from behind. “I was able to pull
away from them, but they just closed the distance in an instant. Ugh…
Daolord Darknorth’s golem is incredibly strong. Its able to rip
through all of those formations with raw force, while my realmship
has no offensive capabilities and can only endure those attacks
passively.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
actively attacked and destroyed the traps and barriers he encountered
while continuing his advance. The realmship, however, could do
nothing but passively endure the attacks it encountered. Each time,
it would be sent flying backwards. This had a dramatic affect on its
speed. Was Archon Silksnow supposed to charge out and attack the
traps like how the golem had? He didn’t have that level of courage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
refuse to believe it. The Jadefire Realm is filled with many dangers.
The Sithe filled this place with mechanisms and traps! There’s no
way that a single golem will be able to burst through all of them.
Once his golem is destroyed, he’ll have to rely on himself to take
on those dangers.” Archon Silksnow still felt that success was
within his grasp. In truth, this was part of his plan as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had prepared multiple plans to deal with Ning. The first was for him
to wait for Ning to launch the attack! Alas, Ning’s sudden usage of
the illusory [Unfettered Dreamlands] had completely ruined that play,
forcing him to actively set off the trap in advance. Unfortunately,
he still hadn’t been able to kill Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
second plan was to rely on the realmship to flee. The realmship was
incredibly sturdy and good at keeping its occupants alive. If Ning
dared to chase, if he wasn’t careful he would hit one of the traps
and would end up dying. Archon Silksnow’s realmship, however, would
be able to endure the hits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
of course, he had a third ‘desperation’ plan…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope I never have to use the third plan.” Archon Silksnow looked at
the two streaks of light chasing after him, a mixed look in his oily
green eyes. “Daolord Darknorth has always outperformed my
expectations. I made so many preparations to set up the stage for his
death, but he actually reached an incredibly terrifying level in
illusions! He’s also gained an insanely strong golem. Judging from
how it has burst through those traps with such ease, this golem is
definitely far more powerful than me. Where in the world did Daolord
Darknorth find such a golem?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship continued to flee. Ning and Whitethaw continued to chase.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
how both sides were moving at maximum speed without carefully
examining the dangers up ahead, they naturally ran into one trap
after another. Ning and Whitethaw ran into more of them, and the
realmship ran into fewer. Ning, however, wasn’t slowed down by the
traps he found. The realmship, in contrast, was. As a result, the
realmship hadn’t been able to shake Ning off, and the two remained
fairly close to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
pursuit lasted for two full days.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
As the speeding realmship passed through the flaming passageways, it
suddenly encountered some sort of invisible power that was extremely
sticky in nature. It instantly wrapped itself around the realmship,
causing it to dramatically slow in speed before finally coming to a
complete halt… and then be pulled backwards and then forwards as if
it was oscillating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
just two oscillations, it came to a complete halt and was stuck there
in midair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” Archon Silksnow stared in shock from within the
realmship. “Move! Move! Hurry up and move!” He tried to will the
realmship into moving, but he felt as though the entire ship had been
trapped by some sort of invisible force that prevented it from moving
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
I been trapped?” Archon Silksnow grew anxious. “Break through!”
With but a thought, he summoned a saber to manifest outside the
realmship. He didn’t dare to go outside the realmship himself, as
the realmship had clearly been trapped; if he exited it, he might
very well die. He used the saber to try and tear through the
invisible force binding him from outside, but as soon as the saber
appeared it also became bound by the invisible power, rendering it
completely immobile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
Archon Silksnow was stupefied when he saw this. “The realmship
isn’t moving, and my treasures won’t move either.” Archon
Silksnow turned to look behind himself. He had previously pulled away
slightly from Ning and Whitethaw, but both were drawing near yet
again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they catch up… given how terrifying Daolord Darknorth’s illusions
are, I’ll probably die. If so… then it’s time to go all out.”
Archon Silksnow narrowed his eyes, immediately manifesting six arms
with six sabers in them. With but a thought, he appeared outside the
realmship as he struck out with all six sabers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
invisible power once more swept over him. “Break!” Archon
Silksnow struck out with all six sabers, but they were only to strike
out to a distance of thirty meters before they brought to a halt by
that invisible power, which had continuously pulled at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
invisible power wrapped itself around Archon Silksnow as well. He
tried to struggle, only to find that he couldn’t move at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-what
the hell type of trap is this?!” Archon Silksnow was furious and
frantic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow.”
Ning’s voice was calm now. “This time, there’s no escaping.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Whitethaw both walked over, raising their heads to stare at the
airborn realmship and Archon Silksnow. Both of them had been ‘stuck’
in midair and were unable to move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wasn’t surprised. They had remained on the ground and so there was
no way they would encounter any excessively powerful barriers, but
Archon Silksnow had been flying through the air this entire time.
Sooner or later, he would fall victim to a powerful trap! As soon as
the two sides had begun this chase, the result had been foreordained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
over, if you have the courage to do so.” Archon Silksnow was
completely unable to move, but he was still able to circulate his
Immortal energy and cause his voice to echo in the air.</P>

Chapter 6: Archon’s Fall</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
wait for you right here. Come over and kill me,” Archon Silksnow
said with a cold laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wouldn’t dare follow you inside.” Ji Ning stood off in the
distance, staring at him. “It’d be pretty miserable to be trapped
there for all of time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
If you don’t come in… I might be trapped here, but I’ll
continue to live. I’ll be able to live a very, very long time.
After 108,000 chaos cycles, you’ll probably have failed your
Daomerge and perished. I, however, will still be alive! My friends
will probably come here and figure out a way to rescue me. Sooner or
later, I’ll break free!” Archon Silksnow stared downwards at
Ning, his white brows fluttering and a look of madness flashing in
his eyes. “So why don’t you come over. Come over and kill me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not going to… but you are still going to die today.” Ning shook
his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Archon Silksnow’s face tightened, his gaze turning colder. “Oh?
I’m quite curious as to just how you think you are going to kill
me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there within the flaming passageway, head raised. He waved his
right hand, causing a Northbow sword to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning stabbed out with his sword, causing sword-light flow like a wave
of water. The sword-light came together in overlapping layers which
stabbed straight towards the distant midair Archon Silksnow. In the
instant that the Northbow sword stabbed it, it transformed to become
a million kilometers long! It seemed to pierce through the skies
themselves as Ning struck out with his Omega Sword Dao – Blood
Drop. This was his most penetrative attack, and the attack which Ning
decided was best-suited for dealing with this sort of invisible
binding power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
When the sword struck out, it pierced straight through the binding
area and was immediately impeded by that invisible force. Ning’s
sword began to move slower and slower; after stabbing in a mere
hundred kilometers, it came to a complete halt and was unable to
advance any further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning frowned. What an odd trap that was. His sword was only able to
stab partially into the field, with Archon Silksnow still tens of
thousands of kilometers away from it. Although the trap had bound
Archon Silksnow, it also made it very hard for Ning to kill him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
you aren’t even close. You can’t even touch me!” Archon
Silksnow laughed coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’re
trapped inside and wrapped up so tightly in the air that you can’t
even move… but you can still laugh? I really do admire you,” Ning
said as he began to consider his options.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Archon Silksnow let out a cold snort. In truth, he did feel quite
miserable. He was completely bound in midair and wasn’t even able
to move a finger. It was as though he had been paralyzed into a
statue. He couldn’t even move his mouth to speak aloud and was
forced to rely on using Immortal energy. How miserable a life would
this be?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so the skinny, white-haired, white-browed Archon Silksnow just stood
there frozen in the air, that tattered and ancient realmship next to
him while Ning considered how to defeat the formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
out!” Ning tried to physically push the Northbow sword deeper, but
the sword didn’t budge at all. Raw force was of no use! Archon
Silksnow wasn’t even able to move. If Ning used some of his
sword-stances to unleash his most powerful attacks, he might be able
to make a bit of progress, but with his sword stuck like that he
wasn’t even able to use any stances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
back here.” Ning willed for the Northbow sword to shrink, and it
quickly began to grow smaller in size. “Grow!” Ning tested out
expanding the Northbow sword in size, but within the trapped region
the sword was constantly being impeded by that invisible force. He
could shrink it, but he couldn’t expand it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. He had no choice but to shrink his sword and to put
it away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
this trap is meant to bind foes. After the foes are trapped inside,
the Sithe would come to either capture them or kill them with ease,”
Whitethaw said. “However, we’re unable to assert control over the
trap and so we have no choice but to burst through it forcefully.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you have a way to do that?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me try brute force first,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brute
force?” Ning’s eyes lit up as he glanced at the golem with
surprise. “Right. Give it a try.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
was a golem and had brute force in spades; in strength alone, he was
at the Hegemon level. Neither Ning nor Archon Silksnow had a chance
to break through with raw power. They were cultivators, after all;
they primarily relied upon their insights into the Dao, not raw
strength! Golems, however, generally had ridiculous amounts of power,
as they primarily relied on the overwhelming physical might of their
golem-bodies. To them, the Dao was secondary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Whitethaw reached out with his furry right hand. His hand expanded
dramatically as he reached into the trapped region and began to be
impeded by that invisible force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
watched closely, as did the distant and immobilized Archon Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The hairy white hand slowly forced its way in, tearing past the
impeding power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Archon Silksnow was shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good!”
Ning was delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
smile appeared on Whitethaw’s stolid face. He then reached out with
his other hand as well, appearing quite confident. His two large
furry hands travelled nearly a hundred kilometers in an instant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible? How?!” Archon Silksnow was beginning to panic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
thousand kilometers… the two giant furry hands moved closer and
closer towards Archon Silksnow and the realmship, with the Archon’s
face becoming grimmer and grimmer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m…
actually going to die here.” Archon Silksnow’s facial expressions
twisted. He knew that once he was drawn into the estate-world, he
would definitely perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Finally, one of the giant furry hands reached the
realmship and latched onto it. The hand was so large that it was able
to completely cover the vessel, separating it from that invisible
binding power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
here.” After getting a firm grip over the realmship, Whitethaw
forcibly drew it into his own estate-world treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
it is your turn.” Whitethaw turned to look at Archon Silksnow,
reaching towards him as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Silksnow, I’d like to invite you into my estate-world. Let’s have
a little chat.” Ning sent out his heartforce which easily pierced
through the invisible power of the trap, surging forward to
completely surround Archon Silksnow. Ning was worried that Archon
Silksnow would transform into his invulnerable snowform when
Whitethaw moved to grab him, making it impossible for Whitethaw to
get a hold on him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
lost.” A forlorn look appeared on Archon Silksnow’s face as he
sensed Ning’s heartforce take effect on him and watched that giant
furry hand stretch out to him. He was still bound by that invisible
power and completely unable to escape. His voice echoed throughout
the empty area, “Daolord Darknorth, I lost. I have roamed the
Flamedragon Realmverse for countless years, and I never thought that
I would’ve died by your hands. However… you are the most powerful
Daolord in all of history. To die by your hands is nothing to be
ashamed of.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
today I shall die… but soon, you shall die as well. Without
question, you will die.” Archon Silksnow’s oily green eyes stared
at the distant Ning, a crazed smile on his face. A moment later, his
gaze grew dull and flat as all signs of life fled his body. Clearly,
he had committed suicide by collapsing his own soul and truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Archon Silksnow’s estate-world. Two figures were seated there in
the lotus position. One was Archon Silksnow’s avatar, the other was
Emperor Bloodcloud’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
aura of life began to vanish from Archon Silksnow’s avatar. The
death of the true body meant that the avatr would perish as well.
“Brother Bloodcloud, I lost. You know what to do.” This was the
final thing Archon Silksnow’s avatar said before dying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow…”
Emperor Bloodcloud’s avatar watched him die, then nodded slowly.
“Yes, I know what to do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Silksnow’s avatar suddenly exploded into countless tiny pieces, the
godsense contained within it being completely extinguished as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
avatar had committed suicide by self-detonation to ensure that there
was no way Ning would know who he had been. Once an avatar broke
apart, it was nothing more than a compilation of treasure fragments;
there was no way to tell what they had originally belonged to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
ordinary-looking chaosworld at the very margins of the Flamedragon
Realmverse. Black clouds rolled about this world. Many Emperors were
present here. This was where the Emperors of Silksnow Fiend Palace
had chosen to hide. This place was filled with many barriers,
ensuring that even if Ning did attack they would have ample time to
flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
died.” Emperor Bloodcloud sat at the peak of a mountain, a look of
grief in his eyes. “Brother Silksnow died.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had simply been far too crazy. Emperor Bloodcloud wasn’t
willing to accompany Silksnow in his madness, but had been willing to
help Silksnow out. Thus, Emperor Bloocloud had sent an avatar
alongside Silksnow in the latter’s scheme to kill Ji Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
end result, however, was that Silksnow failed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… do you think you’ve reaped a great fortune now that
the realmship is in your hands?” Emperor Bloodcloud smiled coldly.
“Soon, the realmverses and otherverses closest to the Flamedragon
Realmverse shall all learn that you, Daolord Darknorth, are in
possession of a realmship as well as many other treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph…
sometimes, owning too much treasure can be fatal.” Emperor
Bloodcloud’s voice was cold. He was absolutely certain that the
Hegemons and other major powers of the various realmverses would go
crazy over the chance to acquire a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the last gift which Silksnow prepared for you… a fatal gift.”
Emperor Bloodcloud had an eager look in his eyes. He eagerly awaited
the day where Darknorth would be killed.</P>

Chapter 7: Realmship</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning stared at Archon Silksnow’s corpse as it lay there in the air
above the flaming passageway. Ning would never have been able to feel
at ease, knowing that some a crazed demon was still around and alive…
but after actually killing him, Ning didn’t feel much much joy,
only a sense of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
least one potential future source of trouble had been gotten rid of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities,” Ning murmured softly,
“Just died in this place.” The eight Archons of the Sacred
Cities… they were figures of legend. The first time Ning had
visited a Sacred City, he had felt a sense of awe, admiration, and
veneration. And yet, one of the awe-inspiring Archons had died, just
like that. True, he had technically committed suicide, but in reality
he had been forced to do it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.” Ning waved his palm gently. It looked like
a casual strike, but it actually encompassed the power of his Omega
Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker. The power of the strike was like a wave
of water that swept across the entire corpse. With no treasures
protecting it, it was easily crushed into dust by the power of Ning’s
palms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand again, collecting all of the treasures which Archon
Silksnow had left behind. Ning revealed a smile. He wasn’t
particularly happy about killing Archon Silksnow, but he was excited
and delighted by the fact that he had just acquired a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
unexpected benefit. This has now become the most valuable treasure I
own.” Ning waved his hand, causing the realmship to be pulled into
it. After acquiring the realmship, Whitethaw had naturally handed it
over to his master immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship was now within Ning’s hand, and it was merely the size of
a palm. It looked quite shabby and ordinary, and it was covered with
marks and scars. In fact, someone who merely looked at it would
probably doubt if it could even fly! However, Ning had chased after
Archon Silksnow for quite some time, and he knew that it could indeed
fly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to bind it.” Ning sent a strand of godsense into the realmship. It
was now ownerless and thus he was able to bind it with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!
Master!” The vessel-spirit immediately sought to ingratiate itself
with Ning, for fear that Ning would kill it. This was the sad fate
which awaited some treasure-spirits and golem-spirits and made them
rather pitiable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
the amount of damage this realmship has taken, is it capable of
teleporting through spacetime?” Ning asked. The damage really did
look quite severe, causing him concern.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
can!” The vessel-spirit said hurriedly, “It’s completely
capable of teleporting through spacetime, but it can’t go too far.
It’ll take many blinks to move within a single realmverse,
primarily because it has suffered quite some damage. Although the
core components are in good shape, many of the other parts have
suffered varying amounts of damage. Some parts are completely
missing, which is why the ship can only unleash a low level of
power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. He didn’t feel disappointed. If the realmship had been
completely undamaged, Archon Silksnow would’ve escaped long ago.
There’s no way Ning would’ve been able to tie him down, resulting
in him eventually falling into a trap and being unable to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I can sense you have a component on you which I desperately need,”
the vessel-spirit said quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning laughed and waved his hand, causing a part which was more than
sixty meters long to appear next to him. This part was a strange
component made up of multiple layers of metal that had many divine
runes carved within it. It was vastly more complicated than any
Hegemon-class golem, and as someone who didn’t understand the Dao
of Artificing, Ning didn’t understand it at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wow,
this piece is huge!” The vessel-spirit grew excited. “Master, can
I swallow it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A wave of invisible power instantly swept across the sixty-meter
component, which rapidly began to shrink until it was just
thumb-sized. While it shrank, it flew towards one of the damaged
areas of the realmship. The part was pulled into the realmship,
followed by the realmship’s surface instantly beginning to glow.
The surface of the realmship began to spread out, with some of the
damage being automatically healed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmships
possess regenerative powers, but there are certain important core
materials they need. With this fairly complete part added into me,
some of the other formerly-missing components can be used to
regenerate and repair some of other parts.” The vessel-spirit was
extremely excited. “Master, now that I’ve been able to repair a
critical component, many of the minor damages are being healed as
well. I can now move nearly a hundred times farther than in the past.
Now, I can teleport through more than half a realmverse with just one
blink!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the realmship in his hand. It now looked much better than
it had in the past. Although it still was covered with scars and
wounds, it didn’t look as ragged as it had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
single blink to teleport through more than half a realmverse? This
was simply shocking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
far are you from perfect status?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Extremely
far.” The vessel-spirit instantly appeared to be rather deflated.
“Although I’m at 90% condition, some of the minor parts which I’m
missing are having a major impact on me as a whole. That’s why I’m
still not able to teleport nearly as great a distance as I would if I
was at 100%.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but nod in agreement. When he had been a Daolord of
the Third Step, he was comparable to supreme Daolords as well as
fairly powerful Emperors. Back then, it would take him roughly a
million chaos cycles to move via teleportation from one realmverse to
another realmverse! Even Hegemons needed to spend extremely long
periods of time. Realmships, however, merely needed a few myriads of
years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
few tens of thousands of years… to travel a distance which Ning
normally needed to spend a million chaos cycles to traverse? Its
teleporting powers were unfathomably superior to Hegemon
Brightshore’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
Master… I can sense that not too far away from me is another
important component which I need desperately. If I can absorb it, I
should be able to repair a great deal,” the vessel-spirit said
immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
a part which my friend has.” Ning nodded, then waved his hand and
put the realmship away for now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning bound and scanned all of the treasures which Archon Silksnow had
left behind. Although there were a few valuable things, none of them
were of much interest to the current Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Despite
that, Ning still felt quite excited. A single realmship was more than
enough! “This realmship has to be far more valuable than even
Crimsonwave Temple. It’s enough to ask an Autarch to help out.”
Ning was extremely excited. “Autarchs possess incredible power and
can create even alternate universes with ease. They are more than
capable of reversing spacetime to rescue Yu Wei.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
this realmship, I can bring her back to life. Hahaha… finally,
finally, finally! I’ve finally done it!” Ning stood there within
the twisting flaming passageway, so excited that his blood was
boiling. The excitement he felt was simply indescribable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Trading
away the realmship to revive Yu Wei… Ning wouldn’t even hesitate
to make this choice!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
a realmship would allow him to travel from one realmverse to another
with ease, doing so by himself would be far too boring. This was
something which Emperors who had lost all their loved ones and who
were curious about the outside world would choose! Ning had been
training for a much shorter period of time. There were many, many
places just within the Flamedragon Realmverse which he had never
visited. And, as a Daolord, his lifespan was limited to just 108,000
chaos cycles. There was simply no need for him to wander about other
realmverse and enjoy the sites there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he could revive her… if he could speak with her once more… that
would the happiest moment of his life. He had no interest in
wandering the outside world by himself. The realmship was meaningless
to Ning; the only thing it was good for was in trade for asking an
Autarch to help him out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
have to ask Emperor Goldisle and Emperor Blackcloud to help out and
invite an Autarch over,” Ning mused. The Dao Alliance had certain
links to the other realmverses. Through the Dao Alliance, he would be
able to send word to an Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go visit Ninedust first.” Ning suppressed his excitement and led
Whitethaw to continue the advance. Thanks to the realmship resonance,
Ning knew the rough area Ninedust was in and thus was able to find
him fairly quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Things
were quite calm on Ning’s side… but a storm was about to erupt
within the Endless Territories. All the major powers, reclusive
Emperors, and countless Daolords had just received word of something
absolutely shocking… one of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities,
Archon Silksnow, had perished!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had been one of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities, which
meant he had a lifeblood tower within the Palace of Immortals of the
Dao Alliance. In the exact instant that Ning had forced him to commit
suicide, his lifeblood tower had crumbled! This news quickly stunned
the entire Palace of Immortals, and word quickly spread out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no need for this news to be suppressed or hidden. All the
Emperors found out, as did the countless Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had died? An exalted Archon of the Sacred Cities… it was
possible to beat them, but to kill them was far, far too difficult.
Even Hegemons found it extremely hard to kill one of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Who
killed him? How did he die? The entire Endless Territories was in a
state of turmoil.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t care about any of this. He continued to advance through the
Jadfire Realm, following the realmship resonance. Finally, he passed
through the flaming tunnels and reached the prison region, arriving
directly at Ninedust’s prison.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust.”
Ning immediately saw a silver-robed man seated in the lotus position
within a cage of flames. It was the Ninedust Sectlord. Ning couldn’t
help but to laugh loudly and call out to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
When Ninedust opened his eyes and saw Ning, he immediately revealed a
look of delight.</P>

Chapter 8: Prison Region</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
look at yourself,” Ji Ning grinned. “Trapped in a cage and unable
to escape.” As he spoke he carefully inspected the flaming cage,
hoping to find a way to break it open.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
just what was I supposed to do? I had nowhere to go and nowhere to
run. I had no choice but to hide inside here!” Ninedust laughed
helplessly. “I might be trapped, but at least I avoided death. It’s
kind of funny, actually… I didn’t die, but Archon Silksnow did!
Darknorth, you are simply incredible. You actually forced him into
committing suicide!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust’s
avatar was at Vastheaven Palace. Thus, as soon as Archon Silksnow had
died Ninedust’s avatar had asked Ning’s avatar what had happened,
resulting in him gaining a general idea of what had happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled. “Don’t praise me. It was mainly thanks to my golem over
here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be able to command a golem of such strength is a testament to your
power as well. Why don’t I have a golem like that? Archon Silksnow
was alive for all those years, but he never acquired a golem like
that. Why? Why did you have one instead of him? Because you are
strong!” Ninedust said, seated in the lotus position inside the
flame cage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had acquired this golem in a trade from Daoist Bluestone. It was
precisely because Ning walked the path of the Omega Sword Dao that
Daoist Bluestone had been willing to hand over such an incredibly
powerful golem to trade for it. Yes, it was indeed due to Ning’s
strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Strength
was needed to acquire any and all treasures. Even if you were lucky
enough to stumble across a treasure of incredible power, if you
yourself weren’t strong enough you would quickly lose it to someone
stronger than you.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone
in the Endless Territories is talking about how Archon Silksnow is
dead. It has been a long, long time since any of the lords of the
Sacred Cities have perished,” Ninedust said excitedly. “I rather
want to tell everyone in the Endless Territories that you forced him
to commit suicide! Haha…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
do that. What really matters right now is getting you out of there
before something unexpected happens.” Ning continued to carefully
examine Ninedust’s cage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Any
ideas?” Ninedust was rather eager.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be so impatient.” Ning scrutinized the cage while analyzing it. It
looked quite ordinary, and it was easily entered… but there was no
way out! Not even Hegemons would be able to escape this cage. The
Ninedust Sectlord had charged into it because he didn’t know
anything about it. Archon Silksnow had been alive for very long and
knew that the most dangerous parts of the Jadefire Realm were its
prisons, and so he didn’t dare to follow Ninedust inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
cage is part of an extremely large formation,” Ning said slowly. “I
can sense some of its ripples in the air. Wait a moment, I’m going
to go take a look at some of the other parts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning flew off into the distance while following the spatial ripples,
with Whitethaw immediately following behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful. I’m in no rush; I have plenty of time. Don’t let
yourself get trapped as well!” Ninedust called out loudly. He knew
how dangerous the Jadefire Realm was and was worried about Ning’s
safety.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
followed the ripples and soon reached another flaming cage in the
air. This one was completely empty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Swoosh. Ning continued to advance while following the ripples. Soon,
he encountered yet another cage…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cages were all formed of flames, and they scattered throughout the
area in a disorderly and irregular manner. However, they seemed to be
connected to each other by invisible threads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s eyes narrowed. The flaming midair cage up ahead was devoid
of all life, but there were some magic treasures inside of it. There
was a greataxe, a suit of armor, an estate-world, and other
treasures. The greataxe was double-bladed, and a lightning-shaped
scar was on its edges. It emanated an aura of power that was simply
shocking; it had to be a Universe treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Universe treasure? Generally, only Emperors can take possession of
Universe treasures. Even if the Emperor was trapped here during the
Dawn Wars, he should still be able to be able to stay alive…”
Ning pondered. “Perhaps some of the cultivators were trapped here
during the Dawn Wars were killed by the ‘Decimatus Wave’, but the
Sithe didn’t have a chance to collect their treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
guess was spot-on. After enough cultivators were trapped within the
many flaming cages within the Jadefire Realm, the Sithe would
activate a single ‘Decimatus Wave’ to wipe them all out in one
go! They would similarly sweep through the cages and collect all the
treasures at one go as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
what happened was that when the Jadefire Realm had been attacked and
breached, the despairing Sithe had chosen to unleash one final
‘Decimatus Wave’ before dying. The treasures of the dead
cultivators were naturally left within the cages.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
one who had breached the Jadefire Realm had been an exalted Autarch!
There was no way someone like an Autarch would slowly pick through
one prison cell after another to loot the various treasures inside.
To Autarchs, such treasures were of minimal interest, and this one in
particular was in a hurry to hasten off to another battlefield.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending a full day, Ning finished inspecting the entire prison
region. The prison region consisted of many flame cages which were
clustered together like the stars in the night sky. The cages were
all linked together as part of one massive and incredibly profound
formation which was divided into seven primary regions! Each of the
seven regions had extremely large cells at their center, with three
of them having been completely destroyed. As a result, the prison as
a whole was no longer able to unleash the ‘Decimatus Wave’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
does it look?” Ninedust immediately asked as Ning flew back to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Some
of the cages in the prison area have been damaged, and three of the
seven primary cages have been destroyed.” Ning looked at Ninedust.
“However, the cage you are in is completely undamaged. I don’t
think even a Hegemon could burst through it with raw power! As for
finding its flaws… I haven’t been able to find anything yet. This
prison formation is simply far too complicated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
couldn’t help but feel both startled and despondent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust,
let me think on this. There’ll definitely be a way to bring you
out.” Ning thought furiously. Even his Primaltwin, seated atop the
Autarch’s stone dais in the second hall of the Azureflower Estate,
was focusing its efforts on finding a solution.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
don’t try to force things. This is nothing.” Ninedust smiled. He
didn’t know much about the Jadefire Realm at first, but after his
avatar had met with Ning’s avatar he had learned quite a bit of
detailed information regarding the Jadefire Realm from Ning. Only now
did he understand how terrifying the prison region was and how
dangerous his situation was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
you yourself said, even if Hegemon Brightshore and the others came
they wouldn’t necessarily be able to breach the prison region. This
was a place used to imprison cultivators during the Dawn War!”
Ninedust said. “Don’t force yourself. I don’t mind be trapped
here. If push comes to shove, I’ll just slowly train here and then
initiate my Daomerge within this cell!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
I succeed, I’ll be a Hegemon with an infinite lifespan. I’ll have
plenty of time to slowly work away at this cell. Sooner or later,
I’ll succeed,” Ninedust consoled Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
central components of the prison region have been destroyed. This
cell might be undamaged, but there’s still a chance to break it
open.” Ning gritted his teeth. He certainly didn’t wish for
Ninedust to stay here until the time came for his Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one day after another. Ning spent a total of nine days in
silent meditation, but still was unable to come up with any ideas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Whitethaw suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Ning glanced towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
another place in the Jadefire Realm which might be of use to you in
unlocking this cell,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
place?” Ning was delighted. “Lead the way immediately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
me, Master.” Whitethaw immediately led the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many cells within the prison region were scattered haphazardly, and
the seven core cages were arranged in a strange pattern in seven
different places. Three of them had been completely destroyed, of
course.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
led Ning in flying towards the most central region of the prison
cells.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Whitethaw pointed towards the empty area up ahead. “I was once
invited over there along with my Sithe master. We entered a special
space over there from where the Sithe controlled the entire Jadefire
Realm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Controlled
the entire Jadefire Realm?” Ning revealed a look of delight.
“Right! I should’ve thought of this long ago. Given how vast it
is and how many flaming passageways and cells it contains, there has
to be a central control mechanism. Whitespace, where is that region?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not sure either.” Whitethaw pointed towards the front. “It should
be within a three hundred meter radius up ahead. I followed my master
inside, and when we entered that region I felt space twist around me.
We immediately appeared inside it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning nodded slowly, then walked through the air towards that region
while keenly scanning it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
His body suddenly broke apart into countless pieces as he assumed his
Shadowless form, closely attuning himself to the dimensional ripples
nearby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
there are some flaws after all.” Ning quickly found the traces of
the dimensional ripples and their strange cadence. His Shadowless
form was able to merge into them and attune to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Arise.”
Ning waved a finger, causing a streak of sword-light to tear through
that region by force. A dimensional tear appeared before him.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_009__Flam"></A>
Chapter 9: Sixteen Realmverses Alliance</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning led Whitethaw into the dimensional tear, going through it and
reaching a sealed pocket dimension. This pocket dimension merely
covered an area of thirty thousand meters, and it had an enormous
black altar within it. Ning and Whitethaw both descended upon the
black altar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Whitethaw said. “The Sithe used this place to control the entire
Jadefire Realm. Every part of it was under their control.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning swept the area with his gaze. The black altar was quite large,
the size of a enormous plaza. Its surface was covered with
incomparably complex and marvelous vein lines, all of which came
together to form an absolutely enormous flower in full bloom which
was surrounded by blazing flames. The pattern of the flames
continuously changed at all times, never quite seeming to duplicate a
previously used pattern.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning was instantly intrigued by it. “That’s the
formation-diagram,” Ning murmured softly. “The flames surrounding
the outermost layer are being used to represent the pathways that can
be taken out of the Jadefire Realm! The pathways are continuously
changing and will never repeat… if you aren’t able to find the
way out, you’ll be trapped inside forever! This is why it is so
easy to enter but so hard to leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
petals… they represent the countless flaming passageways! They are
filled with various traps and mechanisms that can probably be
controlled through this formation diagram. As for the stamen… I can
vaguely make out seven colors which must represent the countless
cells of the seven prisons inside this place.” To try and rescue
Ninedust, Ning had spent quite some time examining the prisons of
this place in detail. Thus, as soon as he saw the formation-diagram
he immediately understand what it represented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
is this of use to you?” Whitethaw immediately asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
some use, but this formation-diagram is far too complex. It seems to
hold some of the mysteries of the Dao of Fire… but it also involves
mysteries of the Dao of the Void. It merges the two together! But
that’s just secondary. What really matters is that it represents an
extremely high level of mastery of the Dao of Formations.” Ning
shook his head. “The problem is, these are based off unique
formations which only the Sithe know. They are completely different
from the ones we cultivators use.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was extremely strange. Just looking at the formations, Ning could
sense a dark, clammy aura sweep towards him and generate an aura of
uncontrollable fear. This was a terrifying formation, a formation
capable of unleashing a ‘Decimatus Wave’. In truth, even the
Sithe had to rely on special techniques to assert control over this
formation-diagram, and the controller didn’t understand it all that
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
problem was, Ning didn’t know those special control techniques.
That meant he would have to truly understand it and then unlock it,
which would be as hard as anything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I want to save Ninedust, I have to master this formation-diagram,”
Ning said softly. Previously, Ning had already completely searched
through the cells. He felt that the formations within the prison were
simply too complex; there was no way he could make any head or tail
of them at all. Everything was shrouded in mist! Now, the
formation-diagram controlling everything was before him, and he was
able to inspect it in detail… but this only inspired even greater
despair. “The prison region…” Ning stared at the ‘stamen’
part of the prison region, increasingly aware of how complex it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head, then stared at the flames which flickered at the
outermost areas of the giant formation-diagram. These represented the
exits from the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s eyes suddenly lit up. “These… these flames…” A light
went off in Ning’s head as he thought back to something he had seen
before. In the first palace of the Azureflower Estate, Autarch
Awakener had gathered together countless techniques from both the
cultivator civilization as well as the Sithe. Ning had memorized all
of those techniques, and one of the Sithe techniques which Autarch
Awakener had retrofitted had included many different formations. Ning
immediately recognized that these flames were a fairly simple variant
of the recorded formation!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, the Seven Flaming Hells’ formation-diagram was one of the
most secret and hidden formation-diagrams of the entire Sithe race.
There was no way they would publicize its internal secrets. Not even
Autarch Awakener had been able to acquired detailed information about
such a thing. However… Autarch Awakener had acquired many other
formations from the Sithe, including some that belonged to the same
‘school’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah…”
Ning began to grin openly, revealing his pearly white teeth. “Hahaha.
A glimmer of hope when all hope seems lost.” Ning quickly began to
sort through the details of that technique he saw, as did his
Primaltwin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
just the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, Ning was able to
completely comprehend and see through the outermost layer of flames
which covered the entire vast formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
that’s how the exits work.” Ning casually waved his finger at one
part of the flames. The flames there continued to change and twist
about, but now everything was under Ning’s control.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Freeze.”
Ning’s will entered the formation-diagram, and with but a thought
the flames that had been twisting and distorting freely began to move
and change in accordance with Ning’s will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a series of images began to appear in the empty space surrounding
Ning. These were illusory projections from the countless flames which
represented the outer layer of the entire Jadefire Realm, including
its entrances! All of the countless flames in the outmost layer were
now under Ning’s complete control, including the various exits. The
flames rumbled and thundered under Ning’s control as he guided them
to change formations and locations. Clearly, by thoroughly
understanding the outermost layers of flames, it was possible to take
control of the outermost formations even if the special control
techniques had not been studied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Master! Felicitations!” Whitethaw said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not even close to where I need to be. I’ve only taken control over
the outermost layer.” Ning shook his head. “I have to control the
entire thing if I want to be able to rescue Ninedust.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
formation-diagram is divided up into three parts. The outermost layer
are the flames, the central layer includes the flower petals, and the
‘stamen’ lies at the core.” Ning stared intently at the
formation-diagram. “The closer to the core we go, the more
difficult it will be. That tiny little flower stamen shall be the
most difficult to master of all; once I master that, I’ll have the
entire formation-diagram under my control.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
I’ve defeated the outermost layer of flames. What of the flower
petals?” Ning looked at the flower petals, which corresponded to
the countless flaming passageways. “This is clearly going to be
much more difficult…” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to analyze the Sithe formation techniques he had available.
Although his Primaltwin was assisted by the Autarch’s stone dais
and was able to train incredibly quickly, the ‘flower petals’
formation was clearly thousands of times more complex and profound
than the ‘writhing flames’ formation.’</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed on, one day after the other. Ning’s Primaltwin had
temporarily brought a halt to its training in the Dao of Water as it
focused completely on the Dao of Formations, specifically the branch
of it pertaining to the formation-diagram of the Seven Flaming Hells.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
‘flower petal’ formation will take me a few hundred thousand
years to comprehend.” After spending some time on it, Ning began to
understand. Although Autarch Awakener had collected many Sithe
formations which could be compared with each other, and although Ning
was both talented and had the Autarch’s stone dais which allowed
him to be in a constant prajna-like state, it would still take him
hundreds of thousands of years to understand this thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what of the ‘flower stamen’ formation which represents the prison
region? That’s the real core of the Seven Flaming Hells.” Ning
stared at the ‘flower stamen’ at the very center of the enormous,
beautiful blooming flower formation before him. Only by mastering
that would he be able to take control over the prisons and rescue
Ninedust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
coiling flames were easy. The flower petal formation was hard. The
flower stamen formation was the hardest, so much so that Ning
couldn’t even estimate how long he would need to master it. One
chaos cycle? Ten? Ning still wasn’t sure if that would be enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seven
Flaming Hells, eh?” Ning closed his eyes and started to meditate.
“One step at a time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
Ning focused on training in the Sithe’s Dao of Formations, the
Endless Territories remained in a state of tumult due to Archon
Silksnow’s death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a vast everworld. This was a place where countless races lived and
thrived, all of them winged. They soared through the skies, the
undisputed lords of this everworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A figure descended from a dimensional rift. It was a blood-robed
elder who emanated the foul odor of blood as he swept the vast
everworld before him with his evil gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goldisle,
my old friend,” the blood-robed elder called out, sending a stream
of godsense out to encompass this entire world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
A streak of golden light appeared, forming into a bald, gold-furred
alien. This was one of the two supreme leaders of the Dao Alliance of
the Endless Territories, Emperor Goldisle. Emperor Goldisle had
established this everworld for the members of his race to live in,
and his avatar was permanently stationed here. Given his power and
how his avatar could link into the many formations protecting his
home, most likely the only ones in the Endless Territory who would
dare to cause trouble here would be the Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bloodcloud.”
Emperor Goldisle frowned as he looked at the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Goldisle.” Emperor Bloodcloud smiled, which just made him look even
fiercer and savager than usual. “I’ve come because there’s
something I need to ask you to help me out with, brother Goldisle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Need
my help?” Emperor Goldisle chuckled. “What, now that Silksnow is
dead, you Emperors are leaderless and rudderless. Are you frightened
and wish for my protection?” In truth, Emperor Goldisle had no
desire to bother with these evil men.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Afraid?
You think I would feel afraid?” Red light shone in Emperor
Bloodcloud’s eyes as he growled, “I, Bloodcloud, swear on my very
life itself that what I’m going to report is complete true and
without falsehood…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle was startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you know how Silksnow actually died and why?” Bloodcloud looked at
Emperor Goldisle. “I’ll explain in detail…” And so, Emperor
Bloodcloud explained the entire sequence of events from start to
finish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…So
the realmship is now in Daolord Darknorth’s hands?!” An
astonished look appeared in Emperor Goldisle’s eyes. “I-i-is this
for real?” But he immediately fell silent; the man had just sworn a
lifeblood oath in front of him! “So that’s the real reason.
Silksnow actually had a realmship, and now it has actually fallen
into Daolord Darknorth’s possession.” The implications of this
were simply far too stunning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
realmship! Who wouldn’t be intrigued by it, driven mad with lust
for it? The combined treasures of all three Hegemons of the
Flamedragon Realmverse weren’t even close to the value of a
realmship. Archon Silksnow had been unspeakably lucky to aquire it,
and he had been extremely low-key, ensuring that no one found out.
Now that he was dead, it had fallen into Ji Ning’s hands. In truth,
the reason he fell was that he was unable to escape from within all
of those barriers and traps. Knowing that his death was certain, he
had chosen to tell Emperor Bloodcloud all about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Goldisle, I wish for you to spread this information to the other
realmverses the Dao Alliance is in,” Emperor Bloodcloud is. “Make
it public.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You—!”
Emperor Goldisle’s face tightened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
you need to do is to make it public. I trust those Hegemons and major
powers will definitely travel towards us at maximum speed, sparing no
expense.” Emperor Bloodcloud smiled, a look of madness in his eyes.
“Brother Goldisle, we Emperors are also members of the Dao
Alliance. It should be able to help us send this information out,
yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Emperor Goldisle nodded. As the leader of the Dao Alliance, he had to
follow certain rules which the Dao Alliance had long ago laid out.
All Emperors of the Dao Alliance could request for him to send out
messages on their behalf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
send word of this to all sixteen of the realmverses in our alliance,”
Emperor Goldisle said. “However, Darknorth is also a member of the
Dao Alliance. I’ll notify him as well.”</P>

Chapter 10: Realmslord Windgrace</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Extremely
far away from the Flamedragon Realmverse was another realmverse known
as the Hiddenfiend Realmverse. Countless cultivators lived here, and
the cultivator civilizations flourished every bit as the ones in the
Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hiddenfiend Realmverse had on particularly special star within it
known as the Blacksun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blacksun was more than a billion kilometers in diameter and
completely black in color. Although it was named ‘Blacksun’, it
was actually a war machine which the Sithe had once paid an
unspeakable price in blood and treasure to assemble. It was vastly
more valuable than any realmship! When the Sithe had lost the Dawn
War, this vast, mighty war machine had fallen into the hands of a
major power who was known as Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooosh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
so often, a streak of light could be seeing flying into our away from
the surface of the Blacksun. Space for ten billion kilometers around
the Blacksun was under invisible pressure and restrictions,
forbidding anyone from using spacetime techniques to teleport through
it. Flying was the only option!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A streak of light flew into the Blacksun, landing on the ground and
coalescing into the form of a white-robed elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed elder raised his head to look at a distant mountain peak,
where a few courtyards could vaguely be seen. He took a single step
forwards, his body flickering as he instantly arrived at the base of
the mountain. He then called out towards a strange stone statue of an
animal, “Second apprentice-brother, please send word! I wish to
meet Master!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seventh
apprentice-brother, you are back?” The stone statue’s eyelids
twitched, voice coming out of its lips: “I’m with Master right
now. We’re drinking together. Uh, Master just said for you to come
over as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed elder smiled. Only then did he climb onto the mountain
and advance at high speeds towards the top. Courtyards were sprinkled
across the peak of this mountain, making it look rather like an
ordinary mountain village of mortals. He soon reached the courtyard
at the very top, at which point a voice rang out from inside: “Come
on inside, Skylight.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The white-robed elder pushed the door open and stepped inside. There
was a table within this quiet, secluded courtyard, as well as two
people next to the table. One was old, the other was young. The old
man had tousled hair and a messy beard, and even his eyebrows looked
rather unkempt and scruffy. As for the youth, he was a chubby-looking
fellow who was shoving meat into his mouth with one hand and pouring
wine into his mouth with the other. His face was covered with oil.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.
Second apprentice-brother,” the white-robed elder called out
respectfully. These two unassuming figures, the sloppy old man and
the fat kid, were actually the most supreme figures in all the
Hiddenfiend Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sloppy old man was a famous and awe-inspiring man who was
acknowledged by all the major powers of the Sixteen Realmworlds
Alliance as their supreme leader… Realmslord Windgrace, master of
the Blacksun!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace was an incredibly powerful Otherverse Lord. During the Dawn
War, he had accomplished great deeds during a critical battle,
reversing the entire flow of events. He had managed to survive the
Dawn War and had won for himself the terrifyingly destructive Sithe
war machine known as the Blacksun. Given his power as well as the
Sithe treasures he now had, no one dared to take him lightly, and so
he was given the paramount position within the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
terms of overall strength, he was also the undisputed number one
figure in all sixteen realmverses! Most likely, only Autarchs could
truly eclipse him in might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the chubby kid? He was the only disciple under Realmslord
Windgrace who had managed to become a Hegemon as well! His Daoist
title was ‘Wuye’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace was an exalted figure with many disciples, but the only one
to succeed in becoming a Hegemon had been the unremarkable ‘Daolord
Wuye’, who had spent all of his time studying constructs. Hegemon
Wuye… he had no interest in fighting for supremacy, and so he
continued to accompany his master here, living a simple and plain
life while spending his time analyzing the strange, bizarre Sithe
artifacts and constructs that he found. Thankfully, Realmslord
Windgrace had many treasures for him to pore over; after they had won
the war, Windgrace had acquired quite a few Sithe golems, and he let
his disciple obsess over them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye was completely obsessed with golems… but in reality, he had
actually become a Hegemon through the Dao of Fire. This was something
which truly rendered countless cultivators completely speechless. In
fact, he didn’t even really do much in preparation for the
Daomerge! One day, when he was in secluded meditation while working
on some golem parts, he simply succeeded in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Hegemon Wuye had put it, “I suddenly had the feeling that I’d
definitely succeed in the Daomerge, so I went ahead and tried it out…
and it really worked.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
words caused countless cultivators to feel both jealousy and despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seventh
apprentice-brother, what is it?” Hegemon Wuye asked casually while
drinking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
does it have to be something, second apprentice-brother? Can’t I
just be missing you and master?” the white-robed elder said
helplessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?
Pshaw. You only ever come when there’s business,” Hegemon Wuye
snickered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace chortled, “Come, Skylight. Sit, sit. Sit and we’ll
talk.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master.” Only then did the white-robed elder sit down and pick up a
glass of wine, accompanying his master and his senior brother for a
few cups before continuing. “Master, I am indeed here on business.
You asked me to watch over the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
of the other two men looked at him. Both of them were extremely
high-level figures who were unwilling to get involved in mundane
management affairs, and so they let those with steadier dispositions
such as Emperor Skylight to manage many things in their stead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Word
has spread from the Flamedragon Realmverse that someone known as
Daolord Darknorth has managed to acquire a realmship,” the
white-robed elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
realmship?” Both Realmslord Windgrace and Hegemon Wuye were
surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t even have a realmship! How does a Daolord have one?”
Hegemon Wuye stared wide-eyed. “Is this for real? Are the three
Hegemons and the many ancient Emperors in the Flamedragon Realmverse
just going to watch without taking it for themselves?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
news is definitely real. It was passed on by an extremely powerful
Emperor who swore a lifeblood oath that this information is true,”
the white-robed elder said. “Daolord Darknorth isn’t easy to deal
with; he may be a Daolord, but he is incredibly strong. Most likely,
he stands at the very apex in the Flamedragon Realmverse’s Dao
Alliance. Over there, only Daoist Bluestone might stand above him.
Supposedly even ‘Archon Silksnow’, one of their ‘eight lords of
the Sacred Cities’, was forced by Daolord Darknorth to commit
suicide. Even Hegemons would find it very difficult to slay him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was able to kill one of the lords of the Sacred Cities?” Hegemon
Wuye was rather surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord?” Realmslord Windgrace murmured, “Can it be an Omega
Dao?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Omega
Dao?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
an Omega Dao?” The two disciples looked at their master, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
never mentioned this before, because not even I have personally
encountered a Daolord who has developed an Omega Dao,” Realmslord
Windgrace said. “However, when I was chatting with an Autarch, he
once mentioned the ‘Omega Daos’ to me.” Realmslord Windgrace
gave a brief explanation of how formidable Omega Daos were, causing
both Hegemon Wuye and Emperor Skylight to feel rather stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
Daolord Darknorth to become second only to Daoist Bluestone in power
means that not only has he developed an Omega Dao, he also has other
things he is relying upon.” Realmslord Windgrace laughed. “I
didn’t imagine that our Sixteen Realmverses Alliance would produce
such a genius.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Has
this information already been spread out?” Realmslord Windgrace
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you already approved of the rules by which the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance were established. Since word was sent from the Flamedragon
Realmverse, all fifteen of the other realmverses have found out about
it. Even the alternate universe you are in control of is probably
aware of this,” the white-robed elder said. “I came to speak to
you about this because I wanted to ask if we should intervene as
well? That’s a realmship, after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wuye,
any interest in it?” Realmslord Windgrace asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Wuye
shook his head. “My focus is on researching golems. What am I going
to do with a realmship? And besides… you already have one, Master.
If I wanted to use one, I’d just borrow yours, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
lazy pig.” Realmslord Windgrace laughed. This was what he actually
liked the most about this disciple, his obssessive nature. Windgrace
had met many major powers in the past, and the ones who managed to
amount to anything were often obsessive by nature. The fact that this
disciple constantly stayed by his side meant that Windgrace couldn’t
help but view his second disciple almost as an actual child. If Wuye
wanted to borrow his realmship, he wouldn’t decline.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
what should we do?” the white-robed elder asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no need for us to get involved into this. All things in the
Chaosverse come and go in a cycle; if he’s strong enough to keep
it, then it will be his. If he is not, then he has no one to blame
but himself,” Realmslord Windgrace laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
is it possible that other Hegemons or Emperors will come and ask you
to activate the Blacksun to send them over to the Flamedragon
Realmverse?” Hegemon Wuye suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
travel from one realmverse to another was extremely arduous and
time-consuming. The normal method of travel was to slowly teleport
through the Great Dark, which would generally take an extremely long
period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
better option would be to travel via a realmship, but even faster
would be to have an Otherverse Lord blaze a path relying on the
otherverse’s prime essences. This would be even faster than using a
realmship, but it was extremely taxing. Generally speaking,
Otherverse Lords would not be willing to do such a thing. Yes, the
Otherverse Lords could slow down a bit and use up less energy, but
that would mean travelling slower than a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fastest option of all was to rely on the power of the Blacksun, which
could allow one to instantly teleport from one realmverse to another.
Once the Blacksun was activated, it would be able to connect to
extremely distant places and, for an exceedingly brief period of
time, form a spacetime conduit would allow instantaneous
teleportation! However, the energy needed to activate the Blacksun
was unspeakably vast. The cost of such a thing was more than enough
to beggar or bankrupt an ordinary Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blacksun had other capabilities as well. Aside from being able to
connect two distant realmverses together via a transversal conduit,
it could be used to launch terrifying attacks as well. It was truly
one of the most deadly Sithe war machines available.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Over
just the chance to win a realmship? There’ll be many competitors,
and they won’t necessarily be the victors in the end… I don’t
think there are many who are determined enough to ask me to activate
the Blacksun,” Realmslord Windgrace said with a laugh. Even he
himself rarely activated the Blacksun. It had remained sealed ever
since the end of the Dawn War, and it now rarely revealed its true
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
information from the Flamedragon Realmverse quickly spread throughout
the other fifteen realmverses as well as the otherverse. All of the
major powers were stunned to hear that a Daolord could be this
powerful… and they were all covetuous of that realmship!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
strong can a Daolord be, really?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
became a Hegemon countless years ago. How could I be unable to kill a
Daolord?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
information quickly drew many Hegemons and a few Emperors out of
seclusion. A realmship was simply far too enticing an object… and
Daolords were simply viewed as being of no threat at all.</P>

Chapter 11: Heading Off Soon</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Territory. Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle had come to visit this place once more, and both Ji Ning’s
avatar and Emperor Solesky had come out to welcome him in person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,”
Emperor Goldisle immediately began, “I’m embarrassed to have to
tell you about this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Goldisle, come inside and sit. We can discuss things slowly.” Ning
was rather surprised; why was Emperor Goldisle professing to be
‘embarrassed’ as soon as they met?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle nodded, holding back for now. Ning and Solesky led the way
for him as the three entered a secluded side-hall within Vastheaven
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three then sat down, some fine wine placed in front of each of their
tables. The aroma of the wine wafted through the entire hall, but
Emperor Goldisle was in no mood to relax. He shook his head and
sighed, “I’m embarrassed to be telling you this, but… just
today, Emperor Bloodcloud went and sought me out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bloodcloud?”
Ning frowned. Emperor Bloodcloud was definitely the main pillar of
the evil forces left behind by Archon Silksnow! “What, does he want
to beg for mercy?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
where you are wrong, Darknorth.” Emperor Goldisle shook his head.
“He didn’t ask for mercy. Instead, he sought to send word through
the Dao Alliance to the other realmverses about something he had
discovered… and by now, it’s probably made its way to all the
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance? What’s that?” Ning was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
great alliance that was originally established and led by Realmslord
Windgrace. It consists of the Dao Alliances of the sixteen nearest
realmverses which have joined together to ensure stability, peace,
and allies in the event of outside invaders. We can notify each other
of various dangers or important information we discover. In times of
crisis, the sixteen realmverses will be in absolute lockstep and will
not fear any outside forces. Realmslord Windgrace was chosen as the
paramount leader by all sixteen realmverses, and is acclaimed as the
most powerful expert of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace?” Ning sighed in amazement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
strongest in sixteen realmverses?” The nearby Emperor Solesky
sighed in amazement as well. That meant he had to be far stronger
than even Hegemon Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
in control of an alternate universe and is incredibly strong. During
the Dawn War, he rendered incredible merits in battle and ended up in
control of the terrifying Sithe war machine known was the Blacksun…”
Emperor Goldisle continued, “But that’s enough about him. I’m
here because of what Emperor Bloodcloud instructed our Dao Alliance
to send to everyone else. This is something that will be of deep
concern to you, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Solesky exchanged a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
did he say?” Ning had a bad feeling already.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Blackcloud said that it was you who hunted down Archon Silksnow,
forcing him to commit suicide in the end… and that his realmship is
now in your hands.” Emperor Goldisle continued, “Emperor
Bloodcloud asked me to send this information outwards. As you know,
the Dao Alliance is a very loose structure and has just a few basic
rules. There were no grounds for me to reject this proposal… and
even if he didn’t go through me, he would’ve been able to go
through the numerous other Emperors who are connected to the other
realmverses.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to say anything more, brother Goldisle. I understand.” Ning’s
face was tight. “Give me a moment to think.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
you do need to think this over,” Emperor Goldisle agreed, a heavy
look on his face. “Now that word has been sent to all sixteen
realmverses as well as the otherverse which is under Realmslord
Windgrace… I’m worried that quite a few Hegemons and powerful
Emperors will hasten to our Flamedragon Realmverse and try to take
that realmship from you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was lost in thought. Nasty. A truly nasty shot. Archon Silksnow was
just as hard-hearted towards himself as he was towards his foes. He
had never dared to reveal the secrets of the realmship prior to his
passing, so why was it that Emperor Bloodcloud had found out
immediately after he had died? Why was it that Emperor Bloodcloud
also knew that Archon Silksnow had been hunted down by Ning and
forced to commit suicide?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Who
would know all these little details? Aside from Ning himself, only
the deceased Archon Silksnow knew.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nasty
move, Silksnow… so this is the final card up your sleeve to kill
me?” Ning slowly shook his head. “You risked your life to delve
into the Jadefire Realm, all for the purpose of trying to draw me
inside and kill me… and you even came up with a final backup plan
to use the realmship to kill me if you yourself could not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Solesky and Emperor Goldisle both looked at Ning, waiting for him to
make a decision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
why don’t you give the realmship up?” Emperor Solesky couldn’t
help but suggest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
it up?” Ning shook his head. “If I trade the realmship to others,
I’ll still be in possession of a vast amount of treasure. That
treasure will continue to attract greedy eyes from some other major
powers…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
don’t ask for any treasures at all. Just hand it over as a gift,”
Emperor Solesky said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
why do I have to give away my treasures?” Ning shook his head, a
cold smile on his lips and a chilling gleam in his eyes. He then
looked at Emperor Goldisle. “Brother Goldisle, there’s something
I’ll have to trouble you with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
go ahead and say the word.” Emperor Goldisle felt a bit embarrassed
himself, but there had been nothing he could do; the Dao Alliance’s
rules were binding! In addition, quite a few Emperors were connected
to the outside world. Many of them spent their days wandering and
adventuring but kept their avatars back home! Thus, it was extremely
simple to ask these Emperors to help spread the word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no way to stop it at all, and so Emperor Goldisle wasn’t
willing to disobey the laws of the Dao Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
you know, I’ve always wished to reverse spacetime to revive my
Dao-companion.” Ning smiled. “Now that I have this realmship, I
wish to use it to ask an Autarch to do just that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ask
an Autarch?” Emperor Goldisle and Emperor Solesky were both
stunned. They had both heard of Autarchs, but not even the majority
of Hegemons were ever able to actually meet one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Emperor Goldisle nodded repeatedly. “That’s a good solution. If
your treasures ends up in the hands of an Autarch, nobody would be
able to do anything about it! But Darknorth, I have to warn you…
the Dao Alliance can only help you send the word to the Autarch as
soon as possible. As for how long the Autarch will take, we can’t
be sure. To Autarchs, realmships might be nice little toys, but they
still won’t care enough to drop everything for one. They’d only
accept your offer to ensure that the most basic laws of fairness in
the universe are maintained.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded. Autarchs were at the apex of power
amongst cultivators, capable of creating even otherverses with ease.
When the Sithe had been defeated, the Autarchs must’ve acquired
countless spoils of war. Even if that wasn’t the case, at their
level these treasures really held almost no meaning for them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
weren’t truly completely uncaring towards the weaker cultivators…
but they couldn’t just help everyone who asked willy-nilly either!
That wouldn’t be appropriate. Thus, Autarchs operated off a simple
principle… if you wanted one of them to help you out, you had to
pay a corresponding price, even though they themselves didn’t care
about treasure per se.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
I’ll go send the word now,” Emperor Goldisle said. “I’ll get
you a response as soon as I can.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
Ning felt excitement swell in his breast. He was asking a favor of an
Autarch! A favor for a realmship… when would the Autarch come?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Word
quickly spread to Realmslord Windgrace’s territory. He possessed a
pre-eminent status; he was the only one in all the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance who was capable of contacting an Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
wishes to use a realmship to ask an Autarch to revive his
Dao-companion? This Daolord Darknorth is quite the romantic.”
Realmslord Windgrace laughed when he heard this, then immediately
helped send the word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
distant region of great darkness. Within the emptiness of the void,
there was an enormous triangular region with a series of dazzlingly
beautiful palaces in the very center, each of which emanated specks
of golden light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
the very center was a particularly towering palace, the greatest of
them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
An azure-robed youth who emanated the aura of eternity moved to stand
respectfully outside a private room within the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Inside
the private room was a bald, black-robed old man who had a pair of
fleshy antennae growing from the top of his head. His golden eyes
were focused intently on the skull-sized round gray globe in front of
him, and the countless runes and patterns the globe was covered with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fleshy antennae waved about above the bald old man’s head, but his
eyes were filled with excitement. He gently reached out to tap the
gray globe once, causing the countless patterns to instantly change
and an aura of power to build.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Still
not right.” The bald old man shook his head, then reached out with
his ashen white right hand to give it another tap, bringing it back
into quiescence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
A second call rang out from outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Xian’er.
Why are you bothering me?” Only now did the old man notice the
distraction and respond.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace sent word that someone named Daolord Darknorth in the
Flamedragon Realmverse wishes to use a realmship to ask you to help
him reverse spacetime to revive his Dao-companion,” the azure-robed
youth outside said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Another
lovesick man.” The bald old man nodded. “Alright, fine. Got it.
Stop bothering me, I’ll head over there soon!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon?”
The youth outside the door murmured softly, “Master, the last time
you said you would go ‘soon’, you delayed by over 600,000 chaos
cycles…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man’s antennae instantly begin to twist in embarrassment
and irritation. “How dare you mock me, you brat! This time, it
really will be soon! I’ve pretty much finished repairing this
treasure. It needs just a tiny bit more work. Once I’ve finished
repairing it, I’ll head over! Alright, don’t bother me again
before I finish this project.’</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The azure-robed youth had no choice but to leave, then send this
response back to his good friend ‘Realmslord Windgrace’.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_012__Flam"></A>
Chapter 12: Escorted</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
helping Ji Ning send word, Emperor Goldisle didn’t immediately
hurry to depart. He instead continued to remain at Vastheaven Palace
as he wanted for the Autarch’s response. Just half a day later,
that response came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Emperor Goldisle immediately sought Ning out. Ning was seated
silently at the peak of a mountain. When he saw Emperor Goldisle fly
towards him, he couldn’t help but feel nervous: “Do we have an
answer?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Emperor Goldisle alighted on the mountain top next to him. “We have
an answer. Ever since the war against the Sithe concluded, it became
hard to locate the Autarchs and virtually no Hegemons know where they
are! We had to rely on Realmslord Windgrace and his extraordinary
status to accomplish it. He rendered major accomplishments during the
Dawn War and is the only person in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance
who can contact the Autarchs… but this time, he was only able to
reach out to Autarch Titanos!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos?” Ning grew eager with anticipation. All Autarchs were
transcendental figures. After the war, Autarch Bolin had created the
Aeonian race and then disappeared. Autarch Awakener was an even more
mysterious figure; he had wandered the entire Chaosverse then
disappeared without a trace as well. It was only thanks to Ning’s
encounter with the Azureflower Estate that he knew Autarch Awakener
had perished in a way which ‘could be considered suicide’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
contact an Autarch was no easy feat!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other Autarchs roam about too much. Only Autarch Titanos stays in his
estate at most times. Supposedly, Autarch Titanos spends all of his
time analyzing the Sithe civilization and is thus the easiest Autarch
to reach. When we need an Autarch to do something, he’s apparently
the one we usually manage to contact,” Emperor Goldisle explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
the Autarch accept?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos did accept, yes. He said he’d come ‘soon’.” A
resigned look was on Emperor Goldisle’s face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon?!”
Ning was overwhelmed with joy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
get too excited. Last time he said the same thing, but he delayed for
over 600,000 chaos cycles,” Emperor Goldisle said. “You
understand, I’m sure. We’re lucky the Autarch agreed to help out
at all; there’s no way to demand them to come here immediately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared. “Did you just say 600,000!?” He would probably be long
dead by then! Daolords only had lifespans of 108,000 chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace asked Emperor Yuxian to nag him a bit…” Emperor
Goldisle shook his head. “Autarch Titanos promised that this time,
he really would come ‘very soon’. He’s extremely close to
finishing some repair work on a Sithe treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was helpless. “How soon is ‘very soon’? Alright, I understand.
I have no choice but to wait.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace said that he’ll do his best to try and contact a
different Autarch as well! But for now, he hasn’t been able to find
any,” Emperor Goldisle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Help
me relay my thanks to Realmslord Windgrace,” Ning said. And in his
heart, he truly did feel grateful. No relationship existed between
him and the Realmslord, the most paramount expert of the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance. The man needed nothing from him; for him to
work so hard on Ning’s behalf was already a show of great goodwill.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a mixture of nervousness, excitement, and disappointment. It was
quite rare for Ning to feel such an emotional potpourri, but this was
simply too important to him. Reviving his wife was the greatest
desire he had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos knows you are a Daolord. He probably won’t delay for too
long,” Emperor Goldisle said consolingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. He had already done everything he could. Hopefully,
Autarch Titanos really would arrive ‘soon’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Next,
I need to worry about how I am going to deal with the Hegemons and
major powers who come from the other realmverses.” There was no way
Ning was going to hand his realmship over to these outsiders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hiddenfiend
Realmverse. The Blacksun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Three
figures were standing atop a deserted plains. One was the chubby
youth, ‘Emperor Wuye’, while the other two were also major
powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wuye,
you are being too greedy. It’s just a trip to the Flamedragon
Realmverse. Why are you asking for that much?” One of the two was a
skinny old man whose skin was covered with a layer of azure scales.
He spoke in an unhappy voice as he looked at his comrade, a tall,
muscular man who had two black wings on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
not only have to send you there, I have to bring you back as well!”
Hegemon Wuye stared at him. “That’s a round trip!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
why do you have to insist on Hegemons costing three times as much as
other Emperors?” the skinny old man continued to mutter unhappily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can I treat them equally? All of you are going to the Flamedragon
Realmverse to fight over the realmship, right? Hegemons naturally
stand a much better chance than all the other Emperors.” Hegemon
Wuye grinned. “Azurefiend, cut the crap already. You should be
counting your lucky stars! You don’t even belong to the Hiddenfiend
Realmverse, you were just passing through. That’s the only reason
you even have a chance to get involved in this opportunity… and you
are even so lucky as to be in the first batch of people I’m
delivering. That means you’ll be amongst the first to get there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Two streaks of light flew towards them from afar. “Hurry
up!” Hegemon Wuye called out to the two. “We’re waiting on you
two!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wuye,
I can’t believe how much you are charging, given how long we have
been friends for.” One of the two figures flying over was a
three-eyed, golden-robed old man who shook his head as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Either
pay the price or figure out a way to go on your own,” Hegemon Wuye
muttered. “It’s pretty rare for me to have a chance to make some
money with this realmship, so cut the moaning.” Hegemon Wuye often
took advantage of his master and used his master’s golems to make
money, but this time he wanted to earn a few more treasures than
usual. This was why he had borrowed the realmship from his master,
offering to send people forward but demanding a high price for it. He
charged Hegemons one price and all other Emperors a different price.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dawnruler,
the fact that we both belong to the Hiddenfiend Realmverse means that
you are going to be the first group of people to arrive at the
Flamedragon Realmverse. Just celebrate your good fortune quietly!
Alright, now that everyone is here we’re going to head off!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye waved his hand, leading Hegemon Azurefiend, Hegemon Dawnruler,
and the other two Emperors into his realmship. He then left the
Hiddenfiend Realmverse and began to advance through the endless Great
Dark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only people belonging to the Hiddenfiend Realmverse who wanted to
take part in this expedition were Hegemon Dawnruler and the two
Emperors! As for Hegemon Azurefiend, he was a wandering Hegemon who
wasn’t native to this place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye’s responsibility was simply to serve as a ferry. He had three
batches of people he was going to deliver in total. Some realmverses
were nearby while others were far away, after all. For the first
batch, he would take a few detours on the way to the Flamedragon
Realmverse, moving through two other nearby realmverses and picking
up a few more people. Thus, he would bring a total of three
realmverses worth of major powers to the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the second batch, he would leave the Flamedragon Realmverse and make
a roundabout trip, bringing the major powers of three more
realmverses to the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the third batch, he would only be able to bring the major powers from
two of the most distant realmverses over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
made for a total of eight realmverses! The reason why he was only
responsible for eight was because someone was competing for the same
business. In the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, there was someone else
known as Hegemon Fogsun who also had a realmship and was doing the
same thing he was. Based on their respective locations, they had
ended up carving out the sixteen realmverses in half, with one side
responsible for eight while the other was responsible for seven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons
were charged one price while other Emperors were charged a different
price. The people in the first batch would be charged a higher price,
while those who went later would be a bit of a discount. However, the
difference wouldn’t be that great. They all knew that given how
Daolord Darknorth had been able to force an Archon to his death, it
would be no easy task for them to force him to give up a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Terror Starsea. The Jadefire Realm. Within that hidden dimensional
control center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
remained seated in the lotus position in the air above the altar,
staring down at the formation-diagrams below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
Hegemon Wuye and Hegemon Fogsun are each in control of a realmship
and are responsible for ferrying the people over?” Ning nodded
slowly. “I wonder which Hegemons and major powers will end up
getting involved.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
information remained highly confidential. Clearly, these major powers
wished to keep as much secret as they could, so as to catch him
off-guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fifteen
realmverses and an otherverse…” Ning calculated silently to
himself, “How many major powers will take part, all combined?” By
now, he had learned quite a bit from Emperor Goldisle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumors
said that even foreign Hegemons were taking part, and more than one
at that. Other rumors whispered that no one within the otherverse was
going to take part. Still other rumors said that as many as three
Hegemons and four Emperors from the Windnest Realmverse were coming
for him. It must be understood that the Windnest Realmverse only had
a total of four Hegemons; that meant that the majority of its elite
experts were all coming…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
sorts of rumors were flying around, some real and some false. This
caused Ning to feel a tremendous sense of pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to master the ‘flower petal formation’ as soon as possible.
By then, I’ll be able to control the countless flaming passageways
and use them against my foes.” Ning stared downwards, his Immortal
energy pouring into the formation-diagram and causing the flower
petals on the giant formation below to light up, revealing
projections of the countless flaming passageways in the air around
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single flaming passageway projection seemed extremely real, and they
were all covered with countless traps and mechanisms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to figure out how to defeat the control mechanisms if I want to
take control over the traps.” Ning shook his head. He had just
barely been able to make some progress in the past few days, which
was why he was able to cause the entire region to appear in the air
around him. However, he was unable to actually control any of it.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_013__Flam"></A>
Chapter 13: Control</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one day at a time. Ji Ning’s Primaltwin remained at the
Azureflower Estate, relying on the Autarch’s stone dais to
furiously meditate on the various techniques that belonged to the
same school as the ‘Seven Flaming Hells Formation’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
years. A hundred years. A thousand years…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, over nine thousand years had gone by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
The white-robed Ning seated in the lotus position in the air above
the giant Seven Flaming Hells formation-diagram began to laugh loudly
as he rose to his feet, a look of delight on his face. Immortal
energy surged from his entire body, flooding into the
formation-diagram and flowing towards the flower petals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom. The projections of the countless flaming passageways once
more appeared in the air around him. Each passageway was as thin as a
strand of silk, and each strand-like passageway was filled with
countless mechanisms and traps. In truth, Ning could see them all
clearly with the naked eye, and he was now able to control every
single one of them as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
meditating for over 900,000 thousand years, I’ve finally managed to
comprehend the flower petal formation.” Ning revealed a look of
delight. Although only nine thousand years had gone by in the ‘real’
world, his Primaltwin had spent this entire period of time under 100x
temporal acceleration.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack
clack clack clack…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom
boom boom boom…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Jadefire Realm was absolutely enormous, and the flaming passageways
made up the largest part of it. Every single flaming passageway was
incredibly long, and the countless flaming passageways formed an
enormous nest which led to the prisons at the very heart!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, all of the countless flaming passageways were trembling. Some of
the previously-revealed mechanisms suddenly went into hiding once
more, while damaged traps began to automatically repair themselves,
with quite a few returning to perfect condition. However, there were
many other areas which had been forcibly torn apart; even though Ning
was able to perfectly control those areas, he wasn’t able to repair
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Roughly
30% of the area has been wrecked.” Ning nodded slowly as he swept
his glance across the countless illusory passageways in midair. “The
Jadefire Realm was damaged so heavily during the war that it is now a
flawed creation. However… in the remaining 70%, the countless
mechanisms and traps are all under my control. It’s now far more
dangerous than it was previously.” Ning’s eyes flashed with the
desire to do battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
he was dreading the major powers who were attacking the Flamedragon
Realmverse. Now, he was merely somber and careful. He was confident
in his chances to deal with them, in his chances to fight back!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
many of the mechanisms and traps within the countless flaming
passageways were exposed due to there being no one in control; this
made it extremely easy for them to move past the mechanisms. Now that
they had a master again, things were different. Even if you didn’t
activate a trap, Ning could cause it to activate with a thought to
envelop you! There were some extremely powerful mechanisms that, when
unleashed, would releases blasts that would cover over ten billion
kilometers. There would be no way to dodge them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Ning mused to himself, “Many Hegemons have come against me… but
I, Darknorth, won’t necessarily lose.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning was more confident in his chances now that he was in control of
the tunnel passageways, he still didn’t dare to be overconfident.
He knew just how powerful his foes were, and they all knew how
dangerous the Jadefire Realm was. There was no way they would be
easily trapped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
only thing left is the ‘flower stamen formation’ at the core.”
Ning began to work on analyzing the most difficult-to-understand part
of the formation, the one governing the prison regions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Controlling
the ‘flower stamen formation’ meant controlling all of the
prisons within the area, allowing him to save Ninedust. Alas, many of
the prisons had been destroyed. If they were all perfectly undamaged,
control over them would give him ability to unleash a Decimatus Wave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. More than 80,000 years had gone by in the blink of an eye.
A rip in spacetime suddenly appeared in a region of empty primordial
chaos within the Flamedragon Realmverse, followed by an invisible
bubble of power pushing out of it with an ancient ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
everyone, we’ve reached the Flamedragon Realmverse.” A loud laugh
could be heard, followed by the flying vessel disappearing into thin
air and a group of figures appearing in its place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were a total of ten figures in total. One was Hegemon Wuye, the
others were all various major powers he had picked up. “I’ve
already brought you all to the Flamedragon Realmverse.” Hegemon
Wuye looked at the nine. “You can decide for yourselves if you wish
to wait here for the next batch of Emperors or if you wish to go off
and hunt down Daolord Darknorth on your own. In short, once this is
all concluded I’ll be back to bring you back to your respective
realmverses. Alright, I’m off! I have to go get the next two
batches of Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, brother Wuye.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Wuye, just take your time with the others. The more you delay, the
better.” The nine major powers were all in a good mood. Judging
from time and distance, they shuld’ve been the first to arrive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye took control over his realmship and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go. Let’s head to the Terror Starsea and the Jadefire Realm,” the
skinny azure-scaled old man, ‘Hegemon Azurefiend’, said in a low
voice. Of the nine Emperors present, five were Hegemons while the
other four were quite powerful in their own right. Only those who
were extremely confident in their abilities would dare to come here,
with Hegemon Azurefiend being the strongest of the group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
aren’t too far away from the Terror Starsea.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
travel the fastest. I’ll lead everyone with me,” an man dressed
in graceful azure robes said with a smile. His fingers were as smooth
as alabaster jade, and as he waved his finger he easily tore a path
through spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
Hegemon Oldgem has chosen to guide us, let’s just go ahead and
accept his kind offer.” The other major powers didn’t reject.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he wasn’t quite familiar with the Terror Starsea, Hegemon Oldgem
truly was a formidable figure when it came to travelling. It took him
merely a century or so to arrive outside the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Jadefire Realm. How beautiful.” Hegemon Oldgem stared at the
enormous vortex of flames before them, each of the flames looking
like the petal of a flower. “Supposedly, this was a nightmare for
our people during the Dawn War. Many major powers were imprisoned in
here, and all those who went inside perished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone,
we’ve already collected quite a bit of information regarding the
Jadefire Realm. Based on what we know, entering is easy but leaving
is difficult.” Hegemon Dawnruler said in a cold voice, “Daolord
Darknorth went in a fairly short while ago. I imagine he probably
hasn’t been able to flee just yet. Shall we wait for him outside or
shall we go inside?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
inside of course,” Hegemon Azurefiend said, a glimmer of terrifying
red light flashing in his eyes. “We were the first to arrive here.
If we waste any time, Hegemon Fogsun’s realmship will probably
arrive with another batch of Emperors. By then, we’ll have lost our
first-mover advantage and it’ll be even harder to acquire the
realmship. The more time we waste, the more Emperors will arrive and
the more difficult things will become.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
A bald, grim-looking red-robed man nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree that we should all go in together right away as well,” a
silver-haired elder with a stone sword on his back agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
the five Hegemons were all in occurrence, the other four Emperors
simply exchanged glances but said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
what a pity! I hear that the most powerful figure in the Flamedragon
Realmverse is Hegemon Brightshore. He should know quite a bit about
this Jadefire Realm, but he wasn’t willing to tell us anything
about it at all.” Hegemon Azurefiend chortled. “Still… we were
able to accumulate quite a good amount of intelligence. It should be
enough. The Jadefire Realm was shattered long ago and should no
longer pose of much a danger to us. Come, come! Let’s go inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew
inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go,” Hegemon Oldgem said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
together now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” The nine Emperors began to charge into the vast vortex of
flames, either singly or in pairs. Soon, all of them had entered the
Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are this many flaming passageways?” After entering the Jadefire
Realm, the Emperors saw the countless flaming tunnels off in the
distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Which
one should we choose?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We?
Gentlemen, are we still planning to travel together? Haha, I’m more
accustomed to moving by myself. I’ll go in first. If I’m the
first one to find Daolord Darknorth, the realmship will be mine,”
Hegemon Azurefiend laughed wickedly. He immediately charged into one
of the flaming passageways next to him. He was the most powerful
member of this group of Emperors and thus naturally wasn’t
interested in working together with the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
refused to believe that he wasn’t able to kill a mere Daolord!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Hegemon Dawnruler scanned the area with his three eyes, then
took a single step forwards and transformed into golden light that
burrowed in a distant flaming passageway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
it all be up to fate.” The bald, grim-faced man dressed in red
robes revealed a hint of a smile as he flew into one of the flaming
passageways as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Oldgem, let’s travel together?” the silver-haired elder with the
ancient stone sword on his back asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s.”
Hegemon Oldgem smiled. These two Hegemons flew towards one of the
flaming passageways together. These two came from the same realmverse
and were on extremely good terms with each other; if they acquired
the realmship, they would share it. It wouldn’t really matter who
owned it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
five Hegemons have all gone inside. We should go as well.” The four
remaining Emperors exchanged glances. Soon, they formed into two
squads of two which flew into the flaming passageways as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
hidden control region within the Jadefire Realm. Ning remained seated
in midair above the altar, scanning the surrounding area with his
gaze. The area around him manifested projections of the flaming
passageways of the Jadefire Realm, as well as the nine figures making
their way through those passageways. These nine figures had entered
the Jadefire Realm together, then had separately entered different
passageways. Ning had watched all of this carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
they come?” Ning murmured softly, “This first batch is already
putting me under quite a bit of pressure.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_014__Flam"></A>
Chapter 14: Bait</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
Ji Ning knew that a host of major powers was coming from the various
realmverses for him, he had naturally acquired quite a bit of
material and information on his foes. Hegemon Brightshore and Emperor
Goldisle had been particularly helpful, introducing detailed
information regarding the most famous Hegemons and extremely powerful
Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
when Ning ‘saw’ those nine figures appear through the
formation-diagram, he was able to recognize them at one go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Five
of these nine are Hegemons. Hegemon Oldgem and the Paragon of Swords
are actually working together? They are all being extremely
cautious.” Ning shook his head slowly. “Hegemon Dawnruler…
Hegemon Everworry… hey, this should be Hegemon Azurefiend.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
gaze focused upon the figure of the latter. Hegemon Azurefiend was
flying carefully through the flaming passageways, his eyes glowing
with cold light as he carefully scanned the area in front of him.
Hegemon Azurefiend was even using a pair of rope-type magic treasures
to scout the path ahead for himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Supposedly,
Hegemon Azurefiend is one of the several foreign Hegemons taking part
in this escapade.” Ning carefully scrutinized Hegemon Azurefiend.
Based on what he knew, there were differences in power between
Hegemons; Hegemon Brightshore, for example, was the number one
Hegemon of the Flamedragon Realmverse! Even in the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance, Hegemon Brightshore was powerful enough to rank
in the top five.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, there was no way to rank anyone in greater detail than
that, as most of the Hegemons had never actually battled each other.
Rough rankings could only be based on the performance they had shown
in the past, which was why Realmslord Windgrace was acknowledged to
be the absolute strongest. Next came the likes of Hegemon
Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Windrain and Hegemon Netherlily were considered fairly ‘ordinary’
Hegemons in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Azurefiend is extremely famous! Supposedly, he was born a Chaos
Godbeast and has a strange temperament. He’s extremely powerful and
ranks highly even amongst Hegemons,” Ning mused. “Based on what
the intelligence reports tell me, he should be even stronger than
Hegemon Netherlily and Hegemon Windrain. He should be the strongest
of the five Hegemons in this batch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, there were only a few figures
capable of suppressing Hegemon Azurefiend in power! “Hegemon
Azurefiend, eh?” Several thoughts flickered through Ning’s mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
feign weakness first. These five Hegemons only constitute a small
percentage of the Hegemons who will be coming, after all. The only
trump card I have up my sleeve is my control over the flaming
passageways; once I reveal it, the Hegemons and Emperors who arrive
later will only be even more careful. They might even all travel
together. That’ll make things very troublesome for me,” Ning
mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
by feigning weakness could he lull his foes into underestimating him.
Only then would his foes move independently on their own, as only
when they felt that Ning was not a threat would they be truly
concerned about competing agaist the other Hegemons. This would be of
benefit to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
control over the flaming passageways is a killer trump card. I have
to save it for a moment of maximum effect. That’s my only shot at
reversing the situation.” Ning’s gaze was focused on the nine
illusory figures advancing through the countless passageways. Every
single action they took was within his field of vision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Jadefire Realm really is in terrible shape. A few mechanisms have
appeared, but I was able to discover them all from afar.” Hegemon
Azurefiend continued to fly forwards, two billion-kilometer sized
ropes scouting the way up ahead for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“According
to the legends, the Jadefire Realm was absolutely terrifying when
intact. It’s very weak now. No wonder so many Emperors of the
Flamedragon Realmverse were able to come in, scout the place, and
then leave safely.” Hegemon Azurefiend shook his head and chuckled.
He felt increasingly relaxed; things were much simpler than he had
anticipated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
place might be of danger to weaker Emperors, but he was an exalted
Hegemon. How much of a danger could these damaged, unmanned traps and
mechanisms possibly pose him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, eh? You’ll definitely be mine. Heh heh… I’ll kill
him and then take his realmship, allowing me to easily rove across
the various realmverses. It won’t be as difficult as it is now.”
Hegemon Azurefiend felt quite eager. He was a temperamental
character, but was born liking to wander about by himself and
adventure through the void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Hegemon Azurefiend continued to advance at high speeds through the
flaming passageways, using the many tools he had available to scout
out the path ahead and avoid them with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is easier than expected.” The bald, red-robed, grim-faced man
strolled through the skies, his body emanating with gray light that
illuminated the area ahead of him and laid bare all of the hidden
dangers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
of the major powers felt as though the Jadefire Realm wasn’t as
dangerous as they had thought. So long as they were careful, they
would be able to advance with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one day after the other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon.
Hegemon Azurefiend is the fastest; he’s about to go through the
flaming passageway area and reach the prison region. It is time for
me to make my own move as well. I can’t let them get into and
explore the prison region.” Ning was still seated in the lotus
position above the altar, but a streak of light suddenly flew out of
his body, manifesting into a second ‘Ji Ning’ in the air. This
was a divine power clone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whitethaw,
let’s go,” Ning barked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
Whitethaw said respectfully. Whoosh. Ning waved his hand, causing the
ancient realmship to appear next to him. It was now in much better
shape than it had been when Archon Silksnow had owned it. Ning and
Whitethaw both entered the realmship, then quietly snuck away from
the hidden region, leaving behind just the divine power clone inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
Ning’s divine power clone remained seated above the altar and the
formation-diagram, using its Immortal energy to manipulate the
formation-diagram and maintain control over things from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Controlling
the formation-diagram took very little power. Although this divine
power clone was fairly weak, for it to use Immortal energy to control
the formation-diagram was simplicity itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
his clone present, Ning would be constantly aware of the locations
and behaviors of the nine Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the darkness of the void. An ancient realmship was hovering in the
skies next to a flaming cage, with Ning’s true body and Whitethaw
inside the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ten billion kilometers up ahead, an azure-scaled figure suddenly flew
out from one of the flaming passageways. This figure emanated an
extremely strange aura; it didn’t seem that dominating or
overbearing, but based on Ning’s intelligence reports it definitely
belonged to a terrifying figure who was ranked highly even amongst
other Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Azurefiend!” Ning grinned. “Let’s move.” Swoosh! Ning
controlled his realmship to immediately fly into a nearby flaming
passageway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Azurefiend had just reached the prison region after leaving
the flaming passageways when he suddenly sensed a ripple from afar.
Turning his head, he immediately saw that realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
realmship!” Hegemon Azurefiend was instantly overjoyed, so excited
that his eyes lit up. “Haha, I really am lucky. I actually ran into
the realmship as soon as I arrived here, and it seems as though the
other Hegemons haven’t discovered it yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want to run? Heh heh…” Hegemon Azurefiend’s speed skyrocketed
as he furiously chased after the fleeing realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sent the realmship fleeing into the flaming passageways, beginning a
‘panicked’ flight through the area. Hegemon Azurefiend naturally
followed him into the flaming passageways as well from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
won’t be able to escape. You aren’t going anywhere!” Hegemon
Azurefiend spoke out, his voice carrying a strange, magnetic cadence
that caused the area around Ning to shimmer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
don’t try to show off such meager skill in illusions before me.
Hmph.” Ning’s voice echoed within the flaming passageways as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hand
the realmship over to me and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, you
are doomed!” Hegemon Azurefiend chased frantically from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
think you can doom me? Hmph. I’ll show you just how incredible a
realmship truly is.” Even as Ning’s voice echoed within the
flaming passageways, the realmship suddenly skyrocketed in speed.
Swoosh! It instantly pulled away from Hegemon Azurefiend, throwing
him off and making it so that he could do nothing but watch as Ning
disappeared from his field of vision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“T-that
fast?!” Hegemon Azurefiend was briefly stunned, but his eyes then
flashed with savage light. “Good. What a fine realmship.”
Realmships were meant for travel. When Archon Silksnow had used it,
it was in terrible shape but still far faster than Ning. Now, it had
been repaired considerably and was even faster than before, allowing
Ning to easily throw Hegemon Azurefiend off his trail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. A few months after the last encounter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
realmship!” Hegemon Everworry had just arrived at the prison
region, and his eyes lit up as he saw the distant realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Another
Hegemon?!” Ning’s enraged sound rang out from within the
realmship. “Hegemon Everworry… don’t you feel that you are all
being too shameless?” As he spoke, he sent the realmship diving
into the flaming passageway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Three
years later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
realmship is over there!” Hegemon Oldgem and the Paragon of Swords
were both in hot pursuit of the realmship, which was fleeing in
panic. Every so often, it would blast into certain traps that would
send it spinning, but each time it was able to quickly stabilize
itself and continue to flee at incredible speeds, shaking off both of
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. All nine Emperors and Hegemons were thoroughly enraged; it
was as though the only thing Daolord Darknorth could do was flee!
Given how fast the realmship was, it was extremely hard for them to
catch up to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is extremely familiar with the flaming passageways,
allowing him to avoid many of the most dangerous mechanisms with
ease. Even if he does occasionally run into one of them, his
realmship is able to take the damage.” The nine Hegemons and
Emperors all felt rather helpless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single passageway was extremely long, and the countless passageways
were filled with even more mechanisms. The Emperors had to move with
care, and for now there really was no way for them to catch Ning as
the latter dove here and there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
they continued to waited excitedly. At least the realmship was
remaining within the flaming passageways this entire time. Sooner or
later, they’d catch it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
For now, I’ll keep the most terrifying mechanisms of the
passageways under wraps and keep them off their guard.” Ning
remained quite calm from within his realmship. “I’ll keep their
attention completely focused upon the flaming passageways for now.
That way, so long as they avoid the prison region it’s unlikely
they’ll be able to discover that hidden area.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why Ning had used himself as bait to repeatedly lure them out
was because he was worried that if he just remained in hiding, the
Emperors and Hegemons would begin to search the area with such care
that they might scour every inch of the prison region. The hidden
region was extremely difficult to locate, and Ning himself had only
found it thanks to the guidance of Whitethaw… but his foes were
Hegemons!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
an entire host of Hegemons chose to slowly and patiently search a
region, they might one day be lucky enough to discover it. Once they
did, they’d be able to take over that hidden region, at which point
Ning would no longer be able to control the formation-diagram!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
chances of this happening were quite low, but Ning didn’t dare to
take the risk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need them to know that I’m in the flaming passageways. I need to
focus their attentions on me. That way, they won’t search the
prison region. Once a few more Hegemons and Emperors arrive, it’ll
be time for me to make my move.” Ning was more than patient.</P>

Chapter 15: The Second Batch</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the realmship, located inside one of the flaming passageways inside
the Jadefire Realm. Ji Ning was seated inside the realmship, drinking
some wine. The fragrance of the wine filled the entire vessel, while
the Protector stood solemnly by his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whitethaw,
sit down and have some wine?” Ning said with a relaxed smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
a golem. I don’t need to drink wine,” Whitethaw said flatly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “That’s where you are wrong. I don’t ‘need’
to drink wine either, but I still ‘like’ to drink wine. We still
need to have hobbies, you know. Come, come! I have plenty of precious
wine stored up. Have a taste of all of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need.” Whitethaw continued to stand there by himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
order you to sit down.” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master.” Whitethaw sat down obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Drink.”
Ning pointed at the wine goblet in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
picked up the goblet and dutifully drank the wine, then frowned and
said in a low voice, “I don’t like it. I tried it back when I
followed my previous master, ‘Daoist Bluestone’. I didn’t like
it then, I don’t like it now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?!”
Ning was truly surprised. He waved his hand, causing a hundred
different wine goblets to appear before him as well as more than a
hundred gourds of wine. Wine flew out from each gourd, filling each
one of the goblets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Try
them all. I refuse to believe this. Your body should’ve been
constructed perfectly, including your senses. How could you have no
taste for wine whatsoever? I wager Daoist Bluestone just didn’t let
you try enough types, which is why you didn’t run into anything you
like,” Ning said. “Drink them all up, one cup at a time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
dutifully picked up one goblet after another, draining them in
succession. A look of bewildered resignation was on his
straightforward face. Why was this master of his forcing him to drink
wine?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
done.” Whitethaw quickly finished all of the wine. He remained
quite calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Again.”
Ning refused to believe this. Cultivators drank wine when they had
nothing better to do, and so Ning had plenty of wine on him at all
times. He had acquired large reserves and stockpiles from the
Daolords and Eternal Emperors he had defeated as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Ning continued to pour, while Whitethaw continued to
drink. After drinking for over two hours, Whitethaw suddenly shivered
when he took a sip of wine and said, “Master, this one is good! I
like this one!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning was surprised. He waved his finger, causing some liquid to fly
out of a gourd of wine off in the distance and into Ning’s mouth. A
pungent, sour, acidic taste instantly overfilled his mouth, followed
by an absolutely foul aftertaste. It was so rancid that Ning couldn’t
help but twitch, and he immediately shut his mouth and turned to
stare at Whitethaw: “This one? You like this one?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
liked all types of wine. Some wine was lightly flavored but had
lasting aftertastes, others had flavors that permeated the entire
body. He also enjoyed wine that would plunge his body and soul into a
cool state of refreshedness… but he absolutely hated sour, acidic,
and incredibly pungent wine like this. Even Ning himself wasn’t
sure where he had found this wine; today was the first time for him
to even bring it out of storage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
absolutely disgusting.” Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
good!” Whitethaw stared at Ning, wide-eyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…Fine.
The Chaosverse truly is filled with all sorts of marvels, including
golems who like to drink wine like this. And who would even create
this type of wine?! Ah, forget it. Come, let’s drink together!”
Ning laughed. He finally had someone to drink with him now. Life had
been quite boring recently. Hide-and-seek with these Hegemons and
Emperors was extremely boring. It was too simple, given that his
divine power clone was in perpetual control of the flaming
passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
do you have the feeling that something seems off?” Whitethaw
quickly began to grow more loquacious as the happy feeling from the
wine flooded his body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
seems off?” Ning was startled. “What do you mean?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Hegemons in the flaming passageways here in the Jadefire Realm aren’t
working as hard as in the past in trying to hunt you down,”
Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. “Of course. It has been eighty thousand years! By now,
they’ve realized that catching me will be virtually impossible.
There’s no need for to chase as frantically as they would’ve in
the past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
they haven’t exactly relaxed either. They’ve started to set up a
few small traps in the various passageways, such as masking
formations that hide some of the terrifying mechanisms inherent
within the passageways. They’ve actually put down a few
special-purpose formations to deal with me.” Ning shook his head.
“They don’t realize that all of their movements are under my
observation and control.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
there are already eight Hegemons and ten other Emperors present. In
the end, how many of them will have arrived in total for the sake of
the realmship?” Whitethaw said, worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. He felt a sense of pressure as well. 80,000 years…
Hegemon Wuye and Hegemon Fogsun were both controlling realmships and
thus both had delivered a first batch of Hegemons and Emperors to the
Flamedragon Realmverse during this period of time. Hegemon Wuye’s
first batch had included five Hegemons and four Emperors, while
Hegemon Fogsun’s first batch included three Hegemons and six
Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Based
on my calculations, the second batches should arrive soon,” Ning
said seriously. “I hope they will separately enter the flaming
passageways as well. If they do so, I’ll have a chance to stop
them. My fear is that they will join forces and advance as one unit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons
had many and varied techniques. If four or five of them worked
together, even if Ning unleashed the full power of the mechanisms in
the flaming passageways he still wouldn’t necessarily be able to
stop all five of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
all, there were Hegemons who were extremely skilled in defense, so
much so that they were a match for Otherverse Lords in this regard!
Others specialized in speed, while still others specialized in karma.
When they pooled their talents together, they would become extremely
difficult to deal with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">120,000
years after the public revealing of the existice of the realmship.
Hegemon Wuye was sending the second batch of Hegemons and Emperors
over on this date.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had arrived next to a blazing star that looked like a fiery ball of
heat. A spatial tear appeared in the void next to the star, followed
by a realmship blinking through and coming to a halt next to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
we have arrived. Based on our latest information, Daolord Darknorth
has remained in hiding within the Jadefire Realm this entire time,
while none of the Hegemons or Emperors who have already reached the
Jadefire Realm have been able to take the realmship from him. You all
still stand a very good chance,” Hegemon Wuye said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Regardless
of who ends up with the realmship, you’ve already made a fortune in
treasure from this escapade, brother Wuye,” one of the eight
figures said upon flying out of the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
borrowed this realmship from my master. I’m going to give most of
the treasure to him!” Hegemon Wuye glared at him. “Not gonna
waste words with you. I need to go pick up the final batch. I have a
long road ahead of me.” As he spoke, he took control of the
realmship and flew off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eight
figures remained there within the void, their auras mighty. One of
them, a devilishly handsome man who radiated an aura of cold
insidiousness, let out a cold snort: “Everyone, you can go to the
Jadefire Realm. I’ll be there shortly.” As he spoke, he took a
step forwards and teleported through the air, vanishing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is Hegemon Winterflame going off to?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
do you think? Given the type of person he is, he’s probably off to
capture any and all of Daolord Darknorth’s friends and family.”
The speaker was a bearded man dressed in simple gray robes who
carried eight strange azure planks of wood on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Winterfire
always does stupid shit like this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Blackwood, don’t worry about him. I’ll tear through spacetime and
lead the way.” Of the group of eight who had just arrived, four
were Hegemons, with Winterflame one of them. In truth, his status was
the highest of the eight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Hegemon Blackwood, who was the bearded man with those eight
pieces of azure wooden planks on his back, nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Tearing through spacetime at maximum speed, Hegemon Winterflame
quickly arrived outside the Vastheaven Everworld. “Here we are.”
Hegemon Winterflame stood there within the misty skies, staring at
the distant Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame was dressed in white robes that glowed with blurry white
light. His features were handsome to the point of appearing devilish,
while his skin was so translucent and fine that one could almost see
his blood vessels and veins. His eyes emanated an aura of terrifying
coldness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Based
on the intelligence records I acquired, Archon Silksnow probably
chased someone called ‘Ninedust’ into the Jadefire Realm, then
intentionally released word of this. Daolord Darknorth really did
choose to ignore the danger and charge straight into the Jadefire
Realm. He probably fought against Archon Silksnow inside, with Archon
Silksnow eventually being defeated and force to commit suicide.”
Hegemon Winterflame nodded slowly. “From this, we can tell that
Daolord Darknorth is the sort of person who cares immensely about
personal relationships.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
knew it was a trap, but for his friend’s sake he was still willing
to risk his life and enter the Jadefire Realm… hmph. Headstrong,
sentimental fools like him are the easiest to deal with.” Hegemon
Winterflame’s eyes glowed with cold light. “The Ninedust Sectlord
has probably already been rescued from the Jadefire Realm by
Darknorth… and the other friends Darknorth care about all probably
reside in his clan, Vastheaven Palace!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace: “All I need to
do is to abduct everyone in Vastheaven Palace. The World-level
cultivators, the Daolords, the Emperors… I’ll abduct them all and
force Daolord Darknorth to give me the realmship in exchange for
them. Given his personality, there’s a chance he’ll accept.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_016__Flam"></A>
Chapter 16: First Meeting with Winterflame</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
other Hegemons and Emperors arrived much earlier than I did, but they
accomplished nothing at all. Those fools… all they know is to try
their luck in the Jadefire Realm. I really wonder if they have any
brains at all.” Hegemon Winterfire shook his head and smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was normal for Hegemons to get involved in a competition for a
realmship, much like how Daolords would plunder a World-level
cultivators who somehow managed to acquire the fruits of Crimsonwave
Temple. Amongst cultivators, if you weren’t strong enough then you
didn’t deserve to hold good enough treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
Hegemons stood at the very apex of power in any major organization!
They generally had their own sense of pride and cared tremendously
about face. Realmships were incredibly valuable, and for them to
attack with a Daolord for the sake of winning a realmship was
nothing. But to go capture that Daolord’s friends and then use them
to coerce him? This was absolutely shameful! Figures as exalted as
Hegemons generally did not have the face to do something like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slightly
less elevated figures such as Archon Silksnow might well decide to
carry out such shameless acts, but it was clear from Ning’s power
that there was no chance for non-Hegemonic Emperors to do anything to
Vastheaven Palace! In addition, even if they did make the attempt
they wouldn’t necessarily succeed; could it be that Daolord
Darknorth wouldn’t make any arrangements of his own?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sort of behavior was both shameful as well as unlikely to succeed,
which was why the Hegemons chose to head to Jadefire Realm rather
than Vastheaven Palace. Only truly shameless and insidious figures
like Hegemon Winterflame would choose such a course of action.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons
generally were extremely prideful figures who cared tremendously
about face, but every so often there would be an exception! Hegemon
Winterflame was one such exception.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Vastheaven Palace. The brothers of Vastheaven Palace were all
gathered together, drinking and eating and discussing the Dao with
each other. Ning’s avatar, Ninedust’s avatar, and Emperor Solesky
all sat off to one side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, a terrifying level of power descended upon the palace.
Ning’s avatar raised its head, only to a see a snow-white
silver-scaled claw descend upon them from the skies, emanating an
aura of endless, invisible frost. Even spacetime had been completely
frozen by the pressure, and a bone-piercing chill instantly pervaded
the entire palace. This caused Ning’s face to turn completely pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Someone
came!” Ning shouted mentally, “Enter my estate-world for now.”
As he spoke, he waved his hand. Emperor Solesky, Ninedust’s avatar,
Daolord Battlemaster… none of them fought back at all, allowing
Ning to draw them into his estate-world. Ning had already made
preparations for this eventuality, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had attracted attention from fifteen realmverses and even some
itinerant wandering Hegemons; he naturally had to make complete
preparations for both Vastheaven Palace and the Three Realms. Ning
had actually gone so far as to create a second avatar!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Ning’s true body and his Primaltwin were
each capable of maintaining a ‘peak’ avatar! Thus, he chose to
create a brand new avatar to stand guard over the Three Realms as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The countless runes and barriers covering Vastheaven Palace began to
crack and shatter as the enormous silvery-white scaled claws rent
through the skies. Ning’s avatar flickered slightly as he used his
Shadowless evasion-art to arrive in the air outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cold
energy billowed everywhere, forcing Ning to reveal himself despite
his Shadowless evasion-art. Ning stood there in the air, gazing at
the devilishly handsome man in the distance with alabaster skin who
radiated an aura of coldness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it is Hegemon Winterflame,” Ning said. “Hegemon Winterflame, why
have you come to Vastheaven Palace?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Winterflame’s eyes were fllled with cold malice. “Daolord
Darknorth? So you’ve taken away all your friends and put them into
your estate-world… do you really think there is nothing I can do to
you now? And I think you should know exactly why I am here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame let out a cold snort: “Hand over the realmship
immediately and I won’t cause any trouble for you. Otherwise, your
comrades are all dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
realmship is with my true body, which is at the Jadefire Realm.”
Ning shook his head. “I merely have an avatar here. How am I
supposed to hand over the realmship?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Simple.
Swear a lifeblood oath to hand it over to me and I’ll immediately
leave.” Hegemon Winterflame stared at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head slightly, glancing off into the distance towards some
spacetime ripples which had just appeared, then let out a cold smile.
No longer interested in wasting time on words, he said, “Keep
dreaming.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Hegemon Winterflame glanced backwards as well, only to see that
spacetime was beginning to split apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Reinforcements?
No reinforcements will make it in time,” Hegemon Winterflame roared
angrily. Whoosh! He manifested a ball of white fire out of nowhere,
sending it sweeping through the skies. In front of the ball of white
fire were a series of eight silver-scaled claws, each of which held
some of the white fire as they tore towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
surrounding world had been completely sealed and locked away, while
the aura of frigidity emanating from the white fire caused even
Ning’s avatar to feel amazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Faced with those eight silver-scaled claws and the white fire they
brought, Ning felt a sense of tremendous danger. The white fire in
particular was something unique to Hegemon Winterflame alone; it was
known as the ‘winterflame’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame had been born an Aberrant special lifeform. His true form
was that of a sentient ball of fire that had slowly cultivated and
increased in power until it finally became a Hegemon. The
‘winterflame’ technique was unique to him, and it could be
described as an unspeakably cold ball of fire. Once it touched anyone
weaker than it, it would almost instantly reduce its target to ash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt!”
a low, fierce growl rang out as a titanic head appeared in the
distant spacetime rift. It was Hegemon Brightshore. By now, Ning was
on extremely good terms with Hegemon Brightshore. He was worried
about Vastheaven Palace’s safety and thus had mentioned this matter
to Hegemon Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the past, Hegemon Brightshore hadn’t really cared if Ning died or
not, but ever since Ning had revealed his true power Hegemon
Brightshore had begun to view Ning as he would his own right arm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The silver-scaled claws and the flames tore through everything they
touched. Ning’s avatar was almost indestructibly tough, comparable
to a top-grade Eternal treasure, but it was still completely torn
asunder. This was the power of a Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want to stop me?” A face appeared within the midair ball of flames,
a cold smile on its features. “Even though Hegemon Brightshore has
arrived, he was just a step too slow. I have more than enough time to
kill you and then seize all of your friends in Vastheaven Palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was a Hegemon, after all; although he was weaker than Hegemon
Brightshore, he didn’t fear the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
By now, Hegemon Brightshore’s massive bulk had exited the rift. He
had six curved horns on his head, and his vast body seemed to be
formed from incredibly thick layers of twisted stones. He reached out
with one of his pillar-shaped arms, striking out towards Hegemon
Winterflame.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame’s eight silver-scaled claws hurriedly moved back to
block the attack. An enormous explosion rang out as a shockwave of
indescribable power spread out more than ten billion kilometers…
but outside the ten billion kilometer range, there was no damage
caused whatsoever. Clearly, Hegemon Brightshore wanted to protect the
mortal lifeforms here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The eight silver-scaled claws were destroyed, melting back into that
pool of white fire which then resolved into a humanoid shape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? I wasn’t able to grab anything?” Hegemon Winterflame
had a stunned look on his face. He felt certain that he had destroyed
Ning’s avatar. He wanted to seize Ning’s storage treasures, but
hadn’t been able to find anything at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Looking
for me?” Far off in the distance, light flowed together to form a
humanoid figure. It was Ji Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
invulnerable form?” Hegemon Winterflame’s face tightened. “You,
a cultivator of the Dao of the Sword, have mastered an invulnerable
form?” He had sought out much information regarding Ning and felt
certain that Ning didn’t have an invulnerable form, which was why
he was so confident in his chances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but sigh. His true body was so powerful that not even
Hegemons would necessarily be able to force him to use his
invulnerable form. His avatar, however, had been forced to use it
almost immediately. This was his very first time exposing it in
combat!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
bad, Darknorth.” The towering Hegemon Brightshore reverted to human
form as well, and the snow-robed old man smiled as he looked at Ning.
Hegemon Brightshore really was liking Ning more and more. Now that
Ning had an invulnerable form, killing him would be no easy feat at
all. It was entirely possible that Ning would survive Jadefire Realm
after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, Hegemon Brightshore had no idea that Ning had already
taken partial control over the formation-diagram of the Jadefire
Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Brightshore, thank goodness you made it in time,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Winterflame glanced coldly at Ning, then gave Hegemon
Brightshore a look as well. “You might be able to hide for a time,
but you won’t be able to hide forever. You won’t be able to dodge
me within Jadefire Realm.” Swoosh. Hegemon Winterflame turned and
moved to depart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Indeed,
Hegemon Winterflame. We’ll meet again in the Jadefire Realm,”
Ning called out to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph!
Quite arrogant. Very well then, we’ll meet again in the Jadefire
Realm!” Hegemon Winterflame’s voice was filled with cold malice
as he tore through spacetime and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
silently watched as Hegemon Winterflame departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
wrong?” Hegemon Brightshore walked over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
Hegemon Winterflame has appeared, that means the second batch of
Hegemons and Emperors should have arrived,” Ning said softly. The
first batch held eight Hegemons; how many would the second hold?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
how many Hegemons were present… would he really be able to use the
flaming passageways to stop them?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_017__Flam"></A>
Chapter 17: Divining Danger</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
and more Hegemons are arriving from the other realmverses.” Hegemon
Brightshore looked at Ji Ning. “Darknorth, have you come up with a
plan to deal with them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go, then. Accompany me back to the Brightshore Kingdom,” Hegemon
Brightshore said. Ning didn’t decline. This time, Hegemon
Winterflame attacked; next time, it might be an even more shameless
Hegemon. In the end, his avatar was just much too wea. Without the
Darknorth swords, his avatar was merely on par with Archon Silksnow.
This was why he had been so easily forced to reveal his invulnerable
form. A Hegemon who was willing to pay an extremely high price would
be able to kill his avatar; to reside in the Brightshore Kingdom
would be the safest decision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiip.
A spacetime tear appeared in the starry cosmos, followed by Hegemon
Brightshore leading Ning into the tear and disappearing without a
trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Terror Starsea. The Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Seven figures flew into the giant vortex of flames and entered the
Jadefire Realm. These seven figures belonged to the seven Hegemons
and Emperors who had accompanied Hegemon Winterflame on this journey
to the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Blackwood, what should we do next? Should we enter separately?” a
gaudily violet-robed man spoke out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Blackwood?” the alien Hegemon, a large and muscular man, spoke out
as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
three of the seven were Hegemons. Clearly, they all cared quite a bit
about Hegemon Blackwood’s views. This was because Hegemon Blackwood
was a Hegemon who was extremely skilled in the divination arts of
Numerancy! Although he was much weaker in Numerancy when compared to
Emperor Waveshift, he had still reached a level where he could be
considered number one in the Dao of Numerancy amongst those who still
resided in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Emperor Waveshift himself, he had long ago disappeared to parts
unknown. He was doted on and shown great favor by many Otherverse
Lords and other major powers, all of whom treated him with tremendous
friendliness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Generally
speaking, everyone wished to befriend a major power of the Dao of
Numerancy. No one was willing to offend such a figure. If you wished
to try and kill him, he’d be able to divine it and flee before you
even arrived. Conversely, if you encountered certain dangers or
troubles you might need him to assist you in a bit of Numerancy
divination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me give it a try,” the bearded Hegemon Blackwood said, adjusting
the eight azure wooden planks on his back. “However, as you all
know this struggle over the realmship involves numerous Hegemons as
well as Sithe relics; to apply Numerancy to it shall be extremely
difficult. I tried on the way over but failed each time. Now that
we’ve already entered the Jadefire Realm… perhaps I shall
succeed.” The closer they were to ‘reality’, the easier
Numerancy was to engage in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other six figures didn’t dare to intervene. They watched as Hegemon
Blackwood stood there, eyes closed as the eight azure wooden planks
flew out from behind his black and surrounded him. They levitated
there, circling around him nonstop and circulating with azure light.
Countless runes appeared on their surfaces as an invisible ripple of
power spread out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, a full hour had gone by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Blackwood frowned as he opened his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Blackwood?” the alien Hegemon immediately asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
did it go?” the violet-robed Hegemon asked as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be impatient,” Hegemon Blackwood said. “Follow me into one of
those flaming passageways. Remember, we’re going to stand in front
of the passageway. We’re not going to actually go inside.” As he
spoke, he flew over towards a passageway. The other six figures
hurriedly followed from behind. They soon reached the nearest
passageway, where they all came to a halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of you are to disturb me,” Hegemon Blackwood instructed. He then
sat down in the lotus position and began to calmly focus his entire
mind on Numerancy. The eight pieces of azure wood continuously
swiveled around him, sometimes slow and sometimes fast, carrying a
strange cadence to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Hegemon Blackwood and the others appeared, Ning was
immediately made aware of it. He watched these Hegemons closely from
afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“E?
Not good. They are moving together. Wait, why are they pausing at the
entrance without going any deeper inside?” Ning was puzzled. To
merely be at the entranceway meant they could retreat whenever they
chose; Ning’s control over the flaming passageways wouldn’t give
him any power of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Blackwood spent a total of three years engaging in Numerancy. His
face was rather ashen as he finally opened his eyes, an exhausted
look in his gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Blackwood?”
The other six looked at Hegemon Blackwood, with the violet-robed
Hegemon calling out to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
dangers of the Jadefire Realm primarily reside within the prison
regions and the flaming passageways. So long as we avoid the prison
region, we won’t be in any danger,” Hegemon Blackwood said.
“Thus… the main things for us to be concerned about are the
flaming passageways! After physically entering one of them, my
divinations became a bit clearer than before. There are many
invisible forces disrupting my Numerancy, and those disruptions are
extremely strong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
Hegemon Blackwood didn’t know was that Ning trained in the Omega
Sword Dao. Divining anything which was related to Ning in any way was
guaranteed to be a ridiculously difficult task. Given how many
Hegemons were involved as well as the Sithe ruins known as the
‘Jadefire Realm’, those who didn’t have nigh-perfect mastery
over the Dao of Numerancy wouldn’t be able to see anything clearly
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what’s the conclusion?” the alien Hegemon immediately asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is going to be extremely dangerous,” Hegemon Blackwood said softly.
“I feel as though we are heading into a world of mist. Right now, I
can only come to one vague conclusion… only if we stay together
will we have a chance at being safe. Once we separate… we could
very well die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well die?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
terrifying as that?” the other six were all shocked. Based on what
they knew of this place, the Jadefire Realm was once deadly but had
now fallen into disrepair. It also had no one in control of it, which
meant that it shouldn’t be nearly as dangerous as it once was. To
Hegemons and extremely powerful Emperors, it shouldn’t post much of
a threat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we separate… we might be safe, but we might also die,” Hegemon
Blackwood explained. “But if we stay together, there will be almost
no danger at all. Go ahead and decide; should we move together or
separately? If you agree to travel alongside me, I’ll accompany you
inside as a group. Otherwise, I’ll wait for the next group of
Hegemons and accompany them instead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Together,
of course.” the violet-robed Hegemon and the others all immediately
spoke out in unison. With Emperor Waveshift permanently ‘missing’,
Hegemon Blackwood was now the number one expert of the Dao of
Numerancy in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. Moving alongside
someone like him would be the safest choice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Should
we wait for Hegemon Winterflame?” an Emperor spoke out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
the hell should we?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph,
traveling alongside him is a disgrace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go. Given the detour he took, he’ll be at least two centuries
behind us,” Hegemon Blackwood said calmly. “I certainly don’t
have the patience to wait for him.” Hegemon Blackwood was an
extremely proud figure, far more prideful than even your average
Hegemon. He had never held Hegemon Winterflame in any respect!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
Hegemon Blackwood had spoken, no one else argued the matter. Whoosh.
The seven Hegemons immediatey joined forces to advance through the
flaming passageways together, each using their own techniques to keep
everyone safe. Spacetime techniques, special treasures, secret arts…
they were put on full display as they advanced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
They actually have chosen to advance as a unit?” Previously, Ning
had been relaxing with Whitethaw within a flaming passageway inside
the Jadefire Realm, sipping some wine from inside his hidden
realmship. Now, however, he could no longer relax.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Blackwood, eh? I didn’t expect this many major powers to get
involved, or that one of them would be able to divine a correct path
of action despite my Dao being that of the Omega Dao,” Ning mused.
He was on good terms with Daolord Badlands and thus knew a bit about
the Dao of Numerancy. The more variables that were involved, the more
difficult the divination would become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
trained in an Omega Dao; each time Daolord Badlands tried to engage
in Numerancy divinations regarding Ning, he saw nothing but blank
fogginess. It was extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
(for example) an Autarch was somehow involved in a matter, most
likely not even Emperor Waveshift would be able to divine anything
whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao of Numerancy truly is incredible,” Ning sighed. If his foes had
chosen to travel separately, they would be like meat for his
butcher’s block. Now that they were moving together, there wasn’t
much he could do to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
Hegemon Blackwood and the others have started to move, it’ll be
time to draw in my web soon.” Ning then pondered for a moment,
“Wait, not just yet. I’ll wait for Hegemon Winterflame to arrive
as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame had sought to use Vastheaven Palace to threaten Ning; how
could Ning let him off the hook?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
after roughly 180 or so years, Hegemon Winterflame arrived at the
Jadefire Realm. He randomly picked a flaming passageway, then entered
it. As he did so, Ning finally put down his winecup and rose to his
feet within his realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Jadefire Realm’s flaming passageways now have a total of twelve
Hegemons within them!” Ning was able to clearly track the actions
and movements of all the Hegemons and Emperors. “Once I move
against one of them, I’ll be exposed and the rest will be
forewarned. Thus… I’ll probably only be able to actually capture
one of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Which
one should I choose?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly grinned. “The strongest one, I suppose!”</P>

Chapter 18: Captured</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he was going to rely on the flaming passageways and their traps to
capture a Hegemon, he was going to capture the strongest one. Of the
twelve Hegemons, the strongest had to be Hegemon Azurefiend!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
that slippery Daolord Darknorth. He must have gained an extremely
detailed intelligence report regarding the Jadefire Realm; otherwise,
how could he have been able to throw me off with ease so many times
in a row?” Hegemon Azurefiend sat there in the lotus position in
the air, two rope-type treasures coiling around him. He just quietly
sat there, his senses keenly attuned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
sooner or later, he’ll make a mistake,” Hegemon Azurefiend with
with a cold laugh. “The flaming passageways no longer have just the
original traps in them, they also have the traps set up by the other
Hegemons and Emperors. One instance of bad luck and he’ll hit one
of them. My chance will come them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was extremely patient. The fact that he was willing to
spend such incredible amounts of time drifting between realmverses on
his adventures was testament to his patience. Even if he had to spend
a thousand chaos cycles here in the flaming passageways, he’d still
be more than patient enough to do it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Azurefiend’s ears twitched slightly. He opened his eyes to
stare towards the front, where he soon saw a realmship carefully
advancing through the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
it is. The realmship.” Hegemon Azurefiend was delighted. Swoosh! He
immediately transformed into a streak of light that shot after Ning.
He had spent more than a hundred thousand years in these flaming
passageways, and was already quite familiar with the ones in the area
he was in. He knew where the ‘native’ traps were and were the
traps placed by the Hegemons were, making it easy for him to chase
after his foe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Azurefiend!” The occupant of the realmship seemed to be badly
shocked, immediately turning to flee in a different direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t going anywhere!” Hegemon Azurefiend roared as he chased
from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship continued its panicked flight. Boom! Suddenly, with a loud
explosion, a large amount of boulders appeared out of nowhere and
furiously began to spin and smash against everything within the reach
of the trap. Although the realmship was able to endure the attacks,
it was still smashed flying backwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
perfect opportunity.” Hegemon Azurefiend was overjoyed upon seeing
this and immediately chased over. However, the realmship quickly
escaped from the confines of the trap and began to accelerate once
more as it fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship fled while the Hegemon pursued. Hegemon Azurefiend used his
ropes to blaze a path for him, sweeping away all dangers. Although he
furiously chased after Ning and felt quite familiar with his
surroundings, he still remained quite cautious. This was one of the
reasons why he was still alive despite having visited so many
dangerous regions in so many realmverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perfect.
Come closer.” Ning smiled merrily as he glanced backwards from
within his ‘fleeing’ realmship. He knew the exact locations of
all passageways, all ‘native’ mechanisms, and all
Hegemon-emplaced traps. When he occasionally activated one of them by
mistake, it was nothing more than a pretense!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
arriving up ahead.” Ning felt quite eager… because a terrifying
trap was not too far away from him. This was one of the most deadly
traps located within the endless flaming passageways. The Sithe had
once used it to trap cultivators, then sent them off to the prison
regions. The power of this trap was so great that it could capture a
Hegemon with ease. Even two or three Hegemons in a group would be
caught.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
a larger group of Hegemons meant that one Hegemon might fall into the
trap while the others were still far away, due to them moving at
different speeds. That would be troublesome, which was why Ning chose
a single target this time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to catch a Hegemon.” Ning felt quite excited. In the past, he never
would’ve dared to even imagine such a thing, but now that he was in
control of the flaming passageways he did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The realmship instantly flew past that dangerous mechanism, which
remained unactivated. In recent years, Ning had maintained control
over all of the most dangerous mechanisms and kept them in a
deactivated state, not allowing them to unleash their full power.
This was why the Hegemons hadn’t encountered any serious problems
thus far. The ones that they did see were the ones which had been
revealed long ago by others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
even think of escaping. Your realmship is mine!” Hegemon Azurefiend
furiously chased from behind, attempting to use his ropes to coil
around the realmship from afar. Alas, Daolord Darknorth was simply
too fast in escaping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
here we are. Right there.” Surrounding by the countless illusions
of flaming passageways, Ning’s divine power clone had been watching
this entire time from above the formation-diagram altar. It had
watched as two specks of light had progressed through the passageway,
the first being the realmship while the second being Hegemon
Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Activate!”
Ning’s divine power clone instantly activated the terrifying
mechanism via the formation-diagram, causing the power that had been
hidden for all these years to suddenly explode forth with terrifying
might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Swish! Hegemon Azurefiend had been chasing after Ning at high speed,
and he slammed right into the area of the mechanism.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A strange ripple of dimensional power suddenly appeared. Eight
different places in that flaming passageway began to glow with light
which came to form a vast, illusory cage in midair. The void cage
completely trapped the charging Hegemon Azurefiend, who continued to
fly forwards only to ram straight into the ‘membrane’ of the
cage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Hegemon Azurefiend was sent staggering several steps backwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
What’s going on?” Hegemon Azurefiend suddenly turned pale, a look
of shock and horror appearing on his face as he scanned his
surroundings. He could clearly sense that he had been trapped within
a void cage and see the continuously changing and transforming
membranes around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Hegemon Azurefiend reached out with his right hand, transforming it
into a terrifyingly destructive claw that rent towards the void
membrane. The void membrance made no sound at all. It simply flexed
slightly like a bubble, easily deflecting his power without suffering
any damage whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend’s heart turned ice-cold. He had visited many places and
seen many things, and so he instantly realized that even if he was
ten times more powerful than he was right now, he still probably
wouldn’t be able to defeat this void cage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could there be a void cage here? This is impossible. I’ve traversed
this passageway over ten times, and I’ve scouted out this place
with my ropes right after the realmship flew past it. Neither the
realmship nor my ropes activated the trap. Why did it activate as
soon as I walked past it?” Hegemon Azurefiend could hardly believe
it. “And I didn’t encounter it in the past either. Why did such a
terrifying mechanism suddenly activate without any warning?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
had been over a hundred thousand years. None of the Hegemons or
Emperors had run into any trouble upon entering this place! If there
were any particularly deadly traps here, then logically speaking some
of the other Hegemons and Emperors should’ve been trapped long ago.
However, there had been no word from anyone else in the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance, which meant that the other Emperors were all
fine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
has it suddenly activated now when it wasn’t activated previously?
Is there someone in control of them now?” Hegemon Azurefiend could
think of no other possibilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The ‘fleeing’ realmship suddenly turned and flew back, coming to
a halt outside the void cage. Two figures emerged from the realmship.
One was a white-robed youth with a black sword sheath on his back,
while the other was a furry, white-furred Sithe Protector.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” Hegemon Azurefiend stared at the white-robed youth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Azurefiend. This should be our first time actually meeting
face-to-face.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What,
have you come to gloat now that I’ve fallen into this trap?”
Hegemon Azurefiend said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head slowly. “No. I’ve come to rescue you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Rescue
me?” Hegemon Azurefiend’s face tightened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
I’d like to ask you a question. Would you like to live, or would
you like to die?” Ning smiled as he looked at Hegemon Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
words stnnned Hegemon Azurefiend. He immediately called out in shock,
“Y-you?! It was you?! The person controlling the mechanisms is you?
I thought that some other Hegemon or major power was behind this
trap. I didn’t expect it to be you, you puny little Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as he had fallen for the trap, he had calculated that it was
most likely for someone to have actively unleashed thie mechanism.
Otherwise, why would it have remained dormant for so long, ignoring
both his ropes and the realmship but activating when he flew past? It
had to be a formation that could be activated or deactivated as
needed, which meant there had to be someone controlling it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
What price must I pay to leave this place?” Hegemon Azurefiend
stared at Ning, his eyes flickering with cold light. His voice,
however, remained quite calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Simple.
Be my retainer. I won’t ask for too long; 108,000 chaos cycles will
do,” Ning said. “To a Hegemon like yourself, spending 108,000
chaos cycles wandering the outside world is nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I…
a Hegemon… serve you, a Daolord, as a retainer?” A furious look
appeared in Hegemon Azurefiend’s eyes as he growled, “Don’t you
think you are overestimating yourself a bit much?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am indeed nothing more than a mere Daolord, but your fate, exalted
Hegemon, is now under my control.” Ning stared intently at Hegemon
Azurefiend.</P>

Chapter 19: Death Over Submission</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
fate is in your hands?” Hegemon Azurefiend stared past the void
cage imprisoning him: “If my guess is correct, this is nothing more
than an immaterial cage of barriers. It can at most capture me, not
kill me. So long as I continually assault it, I’ll be able to
deplete its power. I refuse to believe that a single mechanism can
give birth to a permanent force-cage of such power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning nodded slowly. “Impressive deductions, Hegemon. Your words
were correct; if you were to fight back, this void cage wouldn’t be
sustained for too long. But… didn’t you think that the Sithe
would have taken this into consideration?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hrm?”
Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
but a thought, I can create a void link between this cage and the
prison regions,” Ning explained. “I’ll send you off to be
imprisoned there! You should know just how deadly the Jadefire
Realm’s prison region is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was a man who had seen many things. He knew that the Sithe
wouldn’t be so foolish as to expect such a void cage to perpetually
trap their foes; it was entirely possible that there really was a
mechanism by which one could be sent through a void link off into the
prison regions!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
prison regions? The prisons are rather damaged, and the entire region
as a whole has been breached. It isn’t nearly as dangerous as it
once was.” Hegemon Azurefiend laughed coldly, “Given my power,
with enough time I should be able to escape. Even if I’m not able
to escape immediately, I’ll be able to ask other major powers for
succor. You won’t be able to threaten me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are wrong. There are differences even amongst prisons. There are
seven central prisons in particular,” Ning explained, “And
although three of them have crumbled apart, four of them remain in
perfect shape. I’ll send you into one of those four. Forget about
you, not even Otherverse Lords who are trapped within would stand any
chance at escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend’s face tightened. He had read the intelligence reports
regarding the Jadefire Realm and knew of the seven central prisons.
Given how badly damaged the prison regions were in general, they
really wouldn’t necessarily be capable of holding back an
Otherverse Lord. Ning claiming otherwise was probably just a boast…
but imprisoning a Hegemon was entirely possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you decided?” Ning asked. “Being my retainer isn’t exactly
embarrassing! Don’t worry, I won’t make this public. I’ll tell
everyone else that the two of us are extremely close friends who have
known each other forever, which is why you chose to help me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who do you think would believe that?” Hegemon Azurefiend said
coldly, “Who in the world would believe that? Everyone knows I came
to the Jadefire Realm because I want your realmship, and everyone
knows the type of person I am. Give up the realmship and instead
become friends with you, then going so far as to fight to protect
you? Do you really think those Hegemons are absolute imbeciles? Even
a genuine imbecile would be able to tell that I was forced to become
your retainer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seeing
this, Ning frowned. “Then what do you propose?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Being
a retainer for a puny Daolord like yourself would be the greatest
humiliation of my life. There’s no way I would accept.” Hegemon
Azurefiend shook his head, his words completely uncompromising.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a bit troubled. He didn’t expect that the temperamental
Hegemon Azurefiend would actually care so much about face that he
would discard even his life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
about this? Ten thousand chaos cycles!” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Azurefiend shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
gaze grew cold. “A thousand chaos cycles. This is my last offer! I
only need you to serve me for a thousand chaos cycles. To a Hegemon
like yourself, this is an extremely brief period of time. I’ve
already shown mercy to you, considering that you came to try and
steal my treasures. If you refuse even my offer of a thousand chaos
cycles… hmph.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, a thousand chaos cycles really was the final offer Ning was
willing to make. This was because his Primaltwin was consistently
using the Autarch’s stone dais within the Azureflower Estate while
under the effects of 100x temporal acceleration. Thus, a thousand
chaos cycles for his true body would become equivalent to over
100,000 chaos cycles for his Primaltwin… or in other words, time
for the Daomerge. Regardless of whether he succeeded or failed in his
Daomerge, Hegemon Azurefiend would no longer be of much use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
me an answer.” Ning looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend could sense the killing intentions rise in the Daolord
before him, but this only caused him to laugh: “Hahaha! I never
thought that I, Azurefiend, would be put in such dire straights by a
Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I,
Azurefiend, have roamed for countless ages and have lived for
countless years. I’ve killed as I pleased and plundered as I
pleased. Lower my head before a puny Daolord and become his retainer?
I’d rather die!” Hegemon Azurefiend glared at Ning. “Plus…
you aren’t even capable of killing me. Go ahead and lock me up. Go
ahead and send me into the most central prisons within the Jadefire
Realm! When the time comes, I’ll pay an incredible price to
Realmslord Windgrace and have him personally use the Blacksun to
attack the prison and break me out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face tightened. Realmslord Windgrace? The Blacksun was a truly
terrifying weapon the Sithe had left behind from the Dawn War!
Normally, it could be used to briefly create spacetime conduit that
allowed for instantaneous travel to incredibly distant places, but it
also had more savage abilities. It could be used to attack! Once the
accumulated energies were unleashed via the Blacksun, the power would
be so great that even Otherverse Lords might perish before it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace was both an Otherverse Lord and in charge of the Blacksun.
Thus, he possessed a transcendent status even amongst his peers in
the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
foundation of the Jadefire Realm had already been wrecked, causing it
to be dramatically weakened, whereas the Blacksun was undamaged. If
Realmslord Windgrace really did come, he’d probably be capable of
breaching the core jails and rescuing Hegemon Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hear that the price needed to establish a spacetime conduit via the
Blacksun is absolutely enormous,” Ning said. “None of the
Hegemons or Emperors chose to make such a request in order to have a
better chance at the realmship! To have Realmslord Windgrace come
here in person and use the Blacksun to breach a core prison to rescue
you is probably going to cost even more than just creating a
spacetime conduit. Are you sure you can pay such a price?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
cannot.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s gaze was cold while his voice was
growling: “But I’d be willing to serve him as a servant in
recompense!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
a servant?” Ning laughed. “You’d rather be a servant to
Realmslord Windgrace than be a retainer for a mere thousand chaos
cycles to a Daolord like myself. It makes sense. Realmslord Windgrace
is an exalted figure, while I’m nothing but a mere Daolord… but
Azurefiend, are you sure he even needs a servant like you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he doesn’t want a servant like me, then in the future I’ll wander
through other dangerous regions to acquire treasures and slowly repay
him,” Hegemon Azurefiend said. “Based on my understanding of his
temperament, he should probably accept such an offer! Even if he
really isn’t willing to come rescue me, I’d rather remained
trapped here within the prisons.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels reach this place, you’ll perish,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I die, I die. I, Azurefiend, have roamed the Chaosverse and have seen
everything there is to see. Although I do not welcome death, I
welcome humiliation even less! Daolords are as puny as meaningless as
ants. How dare one of you even think to have me, Azurefiend, serve
you as a retainer?” Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Ning mockingly.
“Laughable. Laughable!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the icy-faced Hegemon Azurefiend from outside the cage. In
his heart, he couldn’t help but sigh. His greatest worry had never
been whether or not he would be able to capture a Hegemon. His
greatest worry was… would he be able to convince the Hegemon to
submit?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
called me as a weak as an ant?” Ning said. “Do you really look
down on Daolords that much?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What,
do you think you are strong? All you could do was to trick and trap
me thanks to your control over a few mechanisms. If it wasn’t for
the terrifying traps the Sithe left behind in the Jadefire Realm, do
you think you really would have the chance to boast like this before
me? I’d crush you into dust with one claw.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s
eyes glowed with savage light. “All you can do is hide outside the
cage and brag from a position of safety. How laughable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “You underestimate Daolords too much.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?
I heard you managed to force Archon Silksnow into committing suicide,
right? You probably trapped him in another one of these mechanisms.”
Hegemon Azurefiend truly was filled with rage towards the Daolord
before him. This puny Daolord was insulting him from outside the
cage! How long had it been since a Daolord had ever dared to behave
like this before him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
about this, Azurefiend? Let’s have a little bet,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
bet?” Azurefiend looked at Ning. “What bet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
enter the void cage and have a fight against you,” Ning said. “I’ll
rely on my own real power to fight against you, and I’ll give you
an hour. If you cannot beat me in that hour, you’ll have lost.
You’ll have to accept the results of our wager and become my
retainer!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are willing to come inside to spar against me?” Hegemon
Azurefiend’s eyes lit up. He had been thoroughly infuriated ages
ago, but the void cage made it so that he wasn’t able to injure
Ning in the slightest. That was the only reason why he had managed to
hold onto his temper and waste so much tie talking instead. Now, upon
hearing that this puny Daolord was being so reckless and foolish as
to come on inside, he was instantly delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine,
I’ll take that bet! But I don’t need an hour. Just stand in front
of me and rely on your own power to survive for ten seconds. Do that,
and you’ll have won!” Hegemon Azurefiend’s eyes turned red with
bloodlust. He truly did not believe that an exalted Hegemon like him,
highly-ranked even amongst other Hegemons, would be unable to
annihilate a puny Daolord like Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.
No backing out?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’d
rather die than break my word! Just don’t regret dying by my hands,
you brat.” Hegemon Azurefiend licked his lips, his eyes flashing
with blood light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
With a flicker, Ning flew past the invisible walls and inside the
void cage.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_020__Flam"></A>
Chapter 20: Ji Ning Battles Hegemon Azurefiend</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was slightly startled when he saw Ji Ning head straight
inside the void cage. His lips parted into a strange smile: “Daolord
Darknorth, I originally had rather looked down upon you; you merely
caught me thanks to these traps, but you dared to request for me to
serve you as your retainer! Now, however, I feel a hint of admiration
towards you. At least you have the courage to head straight into this
void cage!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you for your praise,” Ning said with a laugh. “Soon, Azurefiend,
you’ll know that I have power to go with my courage.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might have courage, but it is foolish courage.” Hegemon
Azurefiend’s face turned icy once more as he said solemnly, “Kid,
are you ready? Once you are prepared, I’m going to make my move.”
Given his pride, Hegemon Azurefiend felt absolute confidence in his
own superiority. There was no way he would lower himself to launch a
sneak attack; he was going to crush Daolord Darknorth with
overwhelming, straightforward power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
void cage wasn’t all that large, just three hundred meters or so in
diameter. Ning and Azurefiend stood within it, staring at each other
in midair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can make your move whenever you please.” Ning’s body flickered as
he manifested three heads and six arms, all six Northbow swords
flying into his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Before
we begin, we need to make the stakes clear,” Hegemon Azurefiend
said. “You have to rely on your own strength to battle against me.
If I cannot beat you in ten breaths, I lose. If I lose, I’ll be
your retainer and follow you for a thousand chaos cycles! But if I
win…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you win, I’ll be dead. Once I die, this mechanism will dissipate,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend blinked, then smirked. “Good.” At first, he had an
extremely poor impression of Ning, but now it began to improve. At
least the kid was straightforward!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Use
your most powerful attacks against me. Go ahead. If I attacked first,
you probably wouldn’t have a chance to show your abilities off.”
Hegemon Azurefiend stood there, his posture stately and his aura
reserved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning stared at his opponent. Hegemon Azurefiend was covered
with azure scales. He looked like a skinny old man, and his body
seemed wizened and weak, but he was in truth a breathtakingly savage
Chaos Godbeast who had reached Hegemony! He was probably close to
even Hegemon Brightshore in power and was ranked highly even amongst
his Hegemonic peers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared fixedly at his opponent, while Hegemon Azurefiend kept a close
watch on Ning’s movements as well. Although Hegemon Azurefiend was
supremely confident in his skills, he couldn’t afford to lose this
battle! Thus, he was going to use all his power and not slacken off
in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly…
whoosh! Ning disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where’d
he go?!” Hegemon Azurefiend’s face changed. He swept the entire
void cage with his godsense, but it was as though Daolord Darknorth
had completely disappeared. Not even godsense could locate him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
stupefied, Hegemon Azurefiend’s pride kept him from immediately
attacking. He continued to stand there confidently without moving…
because he had already promised to let Ning launch the first attack!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
calm region of three hundred meters within the void cage was suddenly
filled with explosions. Six Northbow swords appeared out of nowhere,
as did Ning. The six swords instantly unleashed an utterly shocking
amount of power, transforming into sword-tsunamis that simultaneously
slammed against Hegemon Azurefiend. One struck him on the head, two
struck him on the back of his knees, one struck him on his chest, one
struck him on his neck, and one struck him on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
arrogant. My Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker is my most powerful
attack, and its power is close to the Hegemonic level. I might not be
able to crumble top-grade Eternal treasures into dust with this
attack, but I’d at least be able to crack them apart. He dares to
use his body alone to endure this attack without even trying to block
it? He is being far too overconfident.” Ning was rather irritated
and offended by his opponent’s arrogance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
explosions rang out, followed by a stunned look on Hegemon
Azurefiend’s face. He couldn’t help but be sent flying backwards
by the attack, smashing into the void cage wall behind him and coming
to a halt in midair. His body, however, was completely unharmed. Even
his face, which had been hit head-on, didn’t have the slightest
scratch on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord like yourself is actually capable of such power?” Hegemon
Azurefiend was born a Chaos Godbeast and thus held tremendous
advantages in terms of defensive strength. In this regard, he was
actually comparable to an Otherverse Lord. He could stand there
without moving and allow other Hegemons to attack him without
suffering any injuries at all! His body had long ago been crystalized
and refined to the extreme, and his innate abilities gave it a
perfect blend of toughness and suppleness. To injure him was
extremely, extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Hegemon Azurefiend didn’t feel the slightest bit smug. All he felt
was shock, shock at the power of Ning’s sword-stances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…
it is now my turn!” With a furious bellow, Hegemon Azurefiend
exploded forth as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Rings of dimensional power rippled out from around him, spreading out
like waves of water that generated tremendously strong ‘pushes’
that swept out in every direction. This was Hegemon Azurefiend’s
secret art, a truly powerful Hegemonic secret art known as the
‘Azurefiend Fiefdom’. He had spent countless aeons slowly
creating and perfecting this secret art.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dimensional rings spread out, seeking to encompass the entire void
cage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning immediately executed his own secret arts. A pair of golden wings
appeared in the air, ensconced by countless arcs of sword-light.
Together, they formed the Omega Sword Dao – Yin Yang, and they
swept towards the enemy secret art with incomparable sharpness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
Bang! Bang! Faced with those strange dimensional ripples, the golden
wings and the countless arcs of sword-light began to crumble and
break apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heartworld,
descend!” Ning executed his heartworld projection as well, but he
still wasn’t able to prevent his secret arts from crumbling. Ning’s
secret art/heartworld projection combination was fairly strong
amongst Emperors, but compared to the fully-mastered secret arts of a
Hegemon like Azurefiend, he still wasn’t able to keep up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
heartworld projection?” Hegemon Azurefiend glanced at the illusory
world which had manifested around him. He was beginning to gain a
higher opinion of this ‘Daolord Darknorth’ kid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
Hegemon Azurefiend waved his right arm, reaching out with his five
fingers. They stretched out like a giant sun-blotting hand, tearing
through all opposition and causing space itself to bend and compress
before them. Entire world seemed to be born and then instantly
destroyed within those fields of compress space. This was a killer
technique which Hegemon Azurefiend often favored, the ‘End of
Days’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had no time to waste and thus immediately chose to use his killer
attacks. Ten breaths was an extremely long period of time, but
Hegemon Azurefiend had to use all his power to maximize his chances
of victory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
terrifying.” Ning’s face completely paled when he saw this giant
hand reach for him. He was unable to dodge, nor was there anywhere he
could dodge to! Faced with such a dazzling strike, he had only one
option – face it head-on!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the very first time he actually engaged a Hegemon in a
life-and-death battle. Hegemon Azurefiend, based on the reports Ning
had acquired, was most likely stronger than even Hegemon Windrain or
Hegemon Netherlily. Only when actually battling a Hegemon, however,
would one fully understand how terrifying they were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
six of Ning’s swords moved simultaneously. The sword-tsunamis of
water began to spin, transforming into whirlpools of water that then
became a black spinning vortices of darkness. Ning himself seemed to
have transformed into a terrifying black hole that was devouring
everything in the surrounding area. Hegemon Azurefiend himself
couldn’t help but secretly sigh at how profound Daolord Darknorth’s
insight into the Dao was. How was it that a Daolord had reached such
heights? Was this why he dared to battle Hegemons in solo combat?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
The giant hand struck straight against the black hole, and an
extremely soft sound could be heard. It sounded much like a bubble
being popped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black hole broke asunder, while the three-headed, six-armed Ning was
sent flying backwards. He smashed against the walls of the void cage,
which trembled slightly and dissipated the force of the attack.
However, the counter-force from the collision was enough to cause
Ning to stumble a few steps more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Ning in astonishment. “He actually
blocked it. He wasn’t even injured?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, felt as though his blood was in a state of disarray. His
entire body felt numb.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die
for me!” Hegemon Azurefiend exploded with fury. There was no way he
was going to admit defeat. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! One giant claw
after another struck out toward Ning, creating illusions that they
then destroyed with incredible power and speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had no choice but to defend. In just a single breath’s worth of
time, Hegemon Azurefiend had unleashed hundreds of claw-attacks, each
of which was filled with his maximum power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh!”
Blood finally sprayed out of Ning’s mouth, and even his skin was
beginning to turn red. He had been defending furiously against the
barrage of attacks, but even just one of them had been enough to
throw his internals into a state of disarray. Several hundred in a
row was just getting to be too much.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
His divine body still hasn’t broken apart?” Hegemon Azurefiend
began to grow impatient. Whoosh! His body suddenly transformed. He
previously had looked like a skinny, azure-scaled old man, but he now
transformed into a great beast. This was a hooved beast with four
legs which was completely covered in azure scales. His head was
triangular-shaped, while his body was sleek and long. The azure
scales even covered his long tail, which swayed behind him like a
metal whip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This…
this was Hegemon Azurefiend’s true form! He was a Chaos Godbeast.
Only when he reverted to his true form would he be able to unleash
his true, maximum power.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_021__Flam"></A>
Chapter 21: Retainer</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Hegemon Azurefiend’s entire body glowed with black light as a
terrifying aura of destruction swept out from him. His eyes were cold
and unforgiving. This was a terrifyingly deadly Hegemon! This was the
true face of the mercurial-tempered Hegemon Azurefiend. Hegemon
Azurefiend had no intentions of losing, which was why he revealed his
true form and unleashed his most powerful, desperation attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The beast suddenly flew forwards, pouncing towards Ji Ning with claws
outstretched. Ning couldn’t help but feel a sense of innate terror
when faced with this terrifying pair of claw-strikes. These claws
seemed to contain the power to annihilate all things before them, as
if they were the source of destruction itself. They were the source,
the very essence of space and matter!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the most powerful strike Hegemon Azurefiend had at his disposal,
the trump card he had infused all the insights he had gained while
wandering the countless realmverses! Even when he battled other
Hegemons, he rarely displayed this ultimate attack. In battles
between Hegemons, it was rare for fights to end up being to the
death, which meant there was no need to go all-out like this. This
time, however, was different.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was his most powerful attack, an attack which had fused the Dao of
Space and the Dao of Destruction together in a supremely terrifying
attack… ‘Genesis Annihilation’! It was an attack executed with
his true body!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Although Ning was unable to completely suppress the innate fear which
snaked out from his heart, his Dao-heart remained calm and he was
able to face this strike with all of his power. First, he used his
illusory arts. Only then did he use his defensive sword-arts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend’s soul and truesoul were both incomparably strong, as
was his Dao-heart. Ning’s illusions were completely incapable of
shaking him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A massive explosion rang out. As Ning blocked the attack, he could
sense the terrifying force behind the strike and he instantly
understood the principles behind it. The power pervaded countless
different spatial continuums, seeping through karma itself. Faced
with such a strike, even clones and Primaltwins would perish. There
was no way to hide or avoid an attack like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t block it!” Ning instantly exploded into countless streams
of liquid water. Invulnerable form… Shadowless form!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
he was unable to attack this attack head-on, he would deflect its
power instead! As the saying goes, if you cut water with a blade the
water will continue to flow. The same was true for an invulnerable
body, which was constantly changing and mercurial in shape and
nature. This was what allowed it to almost perfectly deflect any
force applied to it. Archon Silksnow was able to perfectly deflect
the power of even Hegemon Brightshore with his invulnerable form.
Only an absolutely overwhelming disparity in power would be enough to
breach someone’s invulnerable form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was indeed much stronger than Ning, but he clearly wasn’t
strong enough to wreck Ning’s ‘invulnerable form’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning transformed into countless streams of water that reformed into a
humanoid shape off in the distance. The three-headed, six-armed Ning
looked cautiously at his opponent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
invulnerable form?” Hegemon Azurefiend, still in his true form,
stared blankly from afar. He just stood there, completely unmoving
and not pressing the attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to nervously inspect Hegemon Azurefiend. Upon seeing that
his foe wasn’t moving, he couldn’t help but call out,
“Azurefiend?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two battled at extreme speeds. Thus far, they had yet to finish the
ten breaths of battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
lost.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s voice suddenly seemed much older than
it had been just a while ago, and a rather dispirited look appeared
on his formerly ferocious triangular face. He returned to his skinny,
elderly human form, a slightly forlorn look on his face as he said
softly, “I didn’t expect that my full-power strike would only be
enough to force you to reveal an invulnerable form. Based on what I
know, you’ve only trained for an extremely short period of time and
have focused exclusively on the Dao of the Sword. I never would’ve
thought that a Daolord who focused on the Dao of the Sword would be
able to acquire an invulnerable form. I lost. I have nothing more to
say.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning had revealed his invulnerable form, Hegemon Azurefiend
had realized that it would be impossible for him to slay Ning. Ning
had already reached a level of power which was on par with that of
the supreme Emperors who were just barely weaker than the Hegemons
themselves! Aside from the twelve Hegemons, there had been fourteen
supreme Emperors who had come to the Jadefire Realm. Most of them
were on the levels of Emperor Goldisle and the other leaders of the
Dao Alliance. They might not be able to defeat Hegemons, but Hegemons
were not capable of killing them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Hegemon Azurefiend had first seen Ning’s power, he hadn’t been
dispirited. This was because he felt that Ning must’ve focused on
the Dao of the Sword; given how briefly he had trained for, Ning
shouldn’t have an invulnerable form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
however, Ning had actually revealed an invulnerable form! That meant
that there was no chance that he, Hegemon Azurefiend, would be able
to actually kill Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
you tell me how it is that you, a Daolord, have reached such power?
You clearly train in the Dao of the Sword; why is it that you have an
invulnerable form?” Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Ning. “AT least
let me understand why I lost.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am indeed just a Daolord, but my Dao is that of the Omega Sword Dao,”
Ning explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Omega
Sword Dao?” Hegemon Azurefiend was puzzled. He didn’t understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are differences amongst Daos. Some Daolords have chosen the most
common of Daos…” Ning didn’t hide anything, telling Azurefiend
about the truth of the Omega Dao. In truth, Ning wasn’t the only
person in the vast Chaosverse who had developed an Omega Dao. Despite
that, there were very, very few who had reached such heights.
Although on occasion a Daolord would be able to accomplish this, they
would quickly fail their Daomerges and die. Their lifespans were all
extremely short, and so very few even knew about them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast majority of Hegemons had never even heard of ‘Omega Daos’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
that’s how it is. Everyone knows that there are differences amongst
Daos, but I never would’ve imagined that the highest-level Dao is
that of the ‘Omega Dao’. All this time, I’ve been puzzled as to
why a Daolord of the Fourth Step like yourself would have reached
such heights in the Dao of the Sword. You might not be at the
Hegemon-level, but you are just half a step beneath that level. Now,
I finally understand. So it is because of your superior Dao, your
Omega Sword Dao.” Hegemon Azurefiend laughed, and his laughter
caused Ning to feel shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
wrong?” Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
look a lot nicer when you laugh. Why do you usually keep such an icy
look on your face?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Azurefiend’s face instantly turned icy once more. “Don’t
get cocky with me, boy. Your Omega Sword Dao isn’t bad, and you are
pretty strong. Per our wager, I’ll be your retainer… but only for
a thousand chaos cycles!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
have to trouble you to help me out in the future, brother
Azurefiend.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Azurefiend let out a cold snort, then said: “Oh, right. I
forgot to tell you. When you trapped me in the void cage and yammered
about making me your retainer, I was so pissed off that I immediately
told everyone about how you caught me. All of the Hegemons and
Emperors from the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance are probably aware
that you are in control of the flaming passageways by now! Hmph. That
means you won’t be able to use this trap a second time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled. “That actually went without saying. A short while ago,
all of the Hegemons and Emperors inside the flaming passageways
stopped moving and no longer dared to enter other ones. I immediately
knew that you probably had spread the word to them! But it is of no
consequence. For you to become my retainer, brother Azurefiend, means
that it was all worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was instantly irritated again. He couldn’t even gain a
verbal advantage over Darknorth. This Daolord really was a pain in
the ass. Still, Hegemon Azurefiend couldn’t help but secretly
chuckle as well. He was no longer feeling quite as upset and stifled
as he was earlier. Previously, he had felt enraged primarily because
he felt as though he was being insulted. Now that Ning had revealed
his true power, Hegemon Azurefiend had lost his wager. There was
nothing more for him to complain about. Finding out that Ning walked
the path of the Omega Sword Dao had actually resulted in him feeling
some admiration towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had lost his bet, and so he would temporarily become the retainer to
a Daolord who walked the path of an Omega Dao. This wasn’t so bad.
Dazzling Daolords like on this caliber were even rarer than Hegemons,
after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and give me an oath to swear,” Hegemon Azurefiend said.
“Hurry up and set up an oath. After swearing it, I’ll be your
retainer for the next thousand chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning felt a surge of joy in his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
Daolord Darknorth is actually in control of the mechanisms and traps
inside the flaming passageways of the Jadefire Realm? Hegemon
Azurefiend fell into one of them?” Hegemon Dawnruler, Hegemon
Everworry, Hegemon Oldgem, Hegemon Blackwood, Hegemon Winterflame…
all of the Hegemons and the many Emperors were all scared silly by
this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder we weren’t able to capture him despite spending so much time
here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually secretly in control of the flaming passageways?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
this information real? Is it perhaps a deception?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors all had their own responses to this
information. The Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, however, was in a
state of absolute bedlam. An entire host of Hegemons and Emperors had
charged into the Jadefire Realm to capture Daolord Darknorth.
Everyone felt certain that he was nothing more than a fish for the
fisherman to catch! Who would’ve thought that he was actually a sea
monster in disguise? Now that he revealed his fangs and his claws, he
stunned all sixteen of the realmverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he was in control of the flaming passageways, didn’t that mean that
the Hegemons and Emperors inside the flaming passageways were in
serious trouble?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know what type of person Hegemon Azurefiend is. Although he’s
temperamental, he’s extremely proud. There’s no way he’d make
up a lie like this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, everyone. Stay right where you are and don’t move. So long
as we don’t move around, Daolord Darknorth won’t be able to use
those mechanisms against us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
we supposed to just sit here forever without moving?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
major powers were all connected to the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance
in their own ways. They were naturally able to send messages to each
other as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
Hegemons and Emperors…” a booming voice suddenly rang out through
every single one of the countless flaming passageways. Ning’s
divine power clone had sent its Immortal energy into the
formation-diagram, causing his voice to echo through every part of
every passageway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
faces of the Hegemons and Emperors inside the flaming passageway all
tightened when they heard this voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
Daolord Darknorth, the person all of you have come here to kill.”
Ning’s voice echoed sonorously through every inch of the flaming
passageways. “In the past, no feuds or grudges existed between us,
and I never wished to be your enemies. However… all of you have
travelled all the way here from your respective realmverses, delving
into the Jadefire Realm to kill me and seize my treasures. Am I
suppose to just let this slide, gentlemen? Everyone in the outside
world would say that I, Daolord Darknorth, am a spineless pushover.
Gentlemen… what do you view as being the best solution to this?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_022__Flam"></A>
Chapter 22: Price</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors were scattered throughout the various flaming
passageways. They were all able to hear what Ji Ning said, but none
of them were in a rush to respond. Instead, they began to use their
Primaltwins, avatars, retainers, and various communication methods
back in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance to discuss this matter
amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard Daolord Darknorth’s voice. He seems to be threatening us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard it as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
I also heard him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
were all able to hear him. It seems as though Daolord Darknorth’s
voice has permeated every single part of the flaming passageways!
This is proof that he does indeed exercise control over the flaming
passageways.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone,
what do you think we should do? The flaming passageways are filled
with such danger that even Hegemon Azurefiend was trapped. Any of us
might fall as well. The only thing we can do seems to be stay where
we are and not move at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
we supposed to just bend over and admit defeat?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. We have so many Hegemons here, while Darknorth is nothing more
than a single Daolord. He won’t dare to go too far.” The Hegemons
and Emperors continued to discuss this matter amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
voice continued to echo through the flaming passageways: “Hegemons
and Emperors, by now you should have already verified that I’m
telling the truth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what do you wish of us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and tell us what you want.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors were all able to maintain their composure. They
were all powerful lords and rulers in their own rights, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I, Daolord Darknorth, am not the wild and unbridled sort.” Ning’s
laughter rang out within the ears of every single Hegemon and
Emperor. “I won’t ask for too much. You’ve come here to kill me
and take my treasures, and I hear that you all came via realmship. I
imagine you already paid quite a price just to make it here. All you
need to do is pay me the same price you paid to travel to the
Flamedragon Realmverse, and I’ll permit you all to leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
bit of price might pain you a bit, but it’s not too excessive. If
you are willing to pay the price, I’ll immediately let you leave.
If you are unwilling to pay any price whatsoever… well, then
there’ll be nothing I can do. I can’t just let you leave like
this. I, Daolord Darknorth, am not someone to be abused by others
without repercussion.” Ning’s voice echoed throughout every part
of the flaming passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a request which Ning had put quite a bit of thought into. Hegemon
Azurefiend had already publicly revealed Ning’s abilities, making
it so that all the Hegemons and Emperors would be on their guard.
Some would even be temporarily immobilized, making it impossible for
Ning to attack them for now. If pushed too hard, they could simply
pay the price needed to ask Realmslord Windgrace to come over and
rescue them one-by-one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Daolord Darknorth… I’m impressed that a trifling Daolord like
yourself was able to control the flaming passageways. However… now
that we already know what you are capable of, you are no longer a
threat to us.” Hegemon Dawnruler stood in the air within a flaming
passageway: “If you are wise, you would immediately swear a
lifeblood oath not to act against us and let us leave safely. That
way, it can even be said that we are on friendly terms with each
other! Otherwise… if you choose to antagonize all these Hegemons
and Emperors, the repercussions shall be far beyond what a trifling
Daolord like yourself can endure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, you might be forgetting something.” Hegemon Winterflame
said in a cold voice, “Only part of the Hegemons and Emperors are
trapped within the flaming passageway! A large number have yet to
arrive. Once they do get here, they will travel together and work
together. There’s no way the flaming passageways will be able to
withstand the combined might of that many Hegemons and Emperors
working in concert. They’ll be able to rescue all of us with ease,
and you’ll be faced with over twenty Hegemons and many Emperors
working together to hunt you down. You won’t even have a place to
run. Even the flaming passageways of the Jadefire Realm will probably
be rent asunder once more!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, you should know your own limits.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Trying
to threaten all of us Hegemons and Emperors at the same time? You
really are quite bold.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Quite
a few of the Hegemons and Emperors began to speak out. Clearly, they
were unwilling to bow their heads before a Daolord. If they were on
their own and had been captured, they probably would’ve lowered
their heads, admitted defeat, and then handed over some treasures.
But given how many of them were trapped here together, they felt
certain that Daolord Darknorth wouldn’t dare to offend them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
you came for me and are now trapped in the flaming passageways that I
control. I need but nod and all of you can depart safely… but you
aren’t willing to pay any price at all for that? Do you really
think that I’m someone you can so easily mistreat? Hmph. Very well,
then. I’ll meet you all one-by-one.” Ning fell silent, having
nothing further to say.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
part of the flaming passageways. Ning and Hegemon Azurefiend were
seated together within Ning’s realmship, drinking some wine
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?
Not bad.” Hegemon Azurefiend took a sniff of the wine in his glass,
a relaxed look on his face. He then took a single small sip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How’d
it go? Didn’t work, did it?” Hegemon Azurefiend smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are all tough old bastards. They weren’t willing to pay any price
at all.” Ning drank some wine, a cold light flashing through his
eyes. “It seems I’ve been too nice to them. They really do think
I’m a pushover.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
you’ve finally thought it through, eh?” Hegemon Azurefiend lidded
his eyes as he continued to drink the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced at Azurefiend. The skinny, shriveled old man looked so vulgar
and obscene as he enjoyed his wine, but he was actually an incredibly
powerful Chaos Godbeast Hegemon who was close to Hegemon Brightshore
in power! Still, Ning was in a superb mood. Now that Azurefiend was
his retainer, it would be much easier for him to deal with Archon
Silksnow’s final act of revenge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go and meet with them. Let’s visit Hegemon Dawnruler first,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
The realmship transformed into a streak of light that advanced
through the flaming passageways, darting through the winding paths at
incredible speeds without encountering any mechanisms at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
never would’ve imagined that one would be able to travel through
these flaming passageways in such a smooth, unimpeded fashion. We
didn’t run into any problems at all.” Hegemon Azurefiend stared
at the outside, then sighed, “When I was chasing after you, it
appears you intentionally ‘ran into’ a few traps. I was quite
excited when I saw it, back then. It appears you were playing with me
the entire time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
had no choice. I wasn’t strong enough to deal with you head-on, and
so I had to play a few tricks with my control over the flaming
passageways. Now that I’m strong enough, there’s no need for me
to continue to play hide-and-seek.” Ning sighed. “With you here,
brother Azurefiend, I can finally bring a true end to this matter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Hegemon Azurefiend nodded in a self-satisfied manner, showing not one
ounce of humility. “Now that I am your retainer… once word
spreads, the Hegemons and Emperors will all be dissuaded from even
harboring designs on your realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
a Hegemon held a realmship, the other Hegemons wouldn’t think to
try and take it. This was because killing a Hegemon was simply far
too difficult. Generally speaking, it would take either an Otherverse
Lord or an entire host of Hegemons working together to accomplish
such a feat. Kill a Hegemon who had a realmship? That would be even
more difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Ning stared towards the front.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
that’s Dawnruler.” Azurefiend grinned as he glanced towards the
front as well. “That old fellow has always been quite proud.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
relaxed a bit upon seeing this. He was worried that Hegemon
Azurefiend would care so much about his face that he wouldn’t
cooperate. Ning’s worry was that even after becoming his retainer,
Hegemon Azurefiend would feel embarrassed upon encountering other
Hegemons that he would feel a bit uncomfortable and out-of-sorts.
This was something Ning didn’t wish to see! In truth, however, as a
Hegemon Azurefiend had an incredibly powerful Dao-heart. Since he had
already come to a decision, he was going to accept it with a calm
heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let us go out,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning rose to his feet as well. Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw
simultaneously flew out of the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
golden-robed elder with three eyes was standing there, a solemn look
on his face as he stared at the halted realmship. Hegemon Dawnruler
was an extremely inflexible, grim, and dominating Hegemon. This was
why he had immediately led the other Hegemons in immediately refusing
Ning’s request for a price to be paid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Dawnruler frowned slightly when he saw three figures fly
towards him from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Azurefiend were shoulder-to-shoulder, while Whitethaw was
slightly behind Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend?”
Hegemon Dawnruler frowned as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dawnruler.”
Hegemon Azurefiend said, “You already know the request which
Darknorth has made. I urge you to be a good boy and accept it. That
way, you’ll be able to leave safely and without any problems.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are speaking on his behalf?” Hegemon Dawnruler frowned, completely
mystified. “Is this the price he demanded of you? Based on my
understanding of you, there’s no way you would’ve agreed to the
demands of a Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already sworn a lifeblood oath to become Daolord Darknorth’s
retainer,” Hegemon Azurefiend said. “As his retainer, I naturally
must assist him whole-heartedly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
Hegemon Dawnruler’s third eye bulged out in disbelief. He had been
alive for countless aeons, but he had never even heard of such a
thing. He stared at Hegemon Azurefiend in disbelief. “Azurefiend,
you are a Hegemon… but you’ve become a retainer to a trifling
Daolord?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
word of this spread, it would undoubtedly cause an enormous stir in
all the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. In fact, word might spread to
even more distant realmverses and otherverses!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_023__Flam"></A>
Chapter 23: Word Spreads</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was completely and utterly unheard of!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons
stood at the very apex of every realmverse and every otherverse. An
exalted Hegemon… serve as a retainer to a Daolord? What sort of a
joke was this? Everyone felt as though this was an absolute joke
which simply wasn’t conceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
third eye is about to pop out from all the bulging,” Hegemon
Azurefiend said with a frown. “What’s there to be surprised
about? Darknorth is extremely strong, second only to Hegemons in
power! I had a wager with him, and I lost. I, Azurefiend, am not the
sort to welch on my bets. I lost and so I will pay my debt. I have
willingly joined Darknorth as his retainer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
Hegemon Dawnruler was completely stunned by Hegemon Azurefiend’s
words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Any
other questions?” Hegemon Azurefiend looked at Dawnruler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive.
Quite impressive.” Hegemon Dawnruler shook his head. “Brother
Azurefiend, I’m impressed by your tolerance levels.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cut
the crap. Now that I am Daolord Darknorth’s retainer, none of the
Hegemons or Emperors heading this way will have any chance of taking
the realmship from him. They probably won’t even come,”
Azurefiend said. “Darknorth didn’t ask for all that much from
you, and he hasn’t put any of you in any actual life-threatening
danger at all. Even if you went to ask Realmslord Windgrace to help
out… given his personality, he probably wouldn’t intervene over
such a minor matter and come help you out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So…
just go ahead and pay the price for freedom. Otherwise, you can just
keep sitting here.” Azurefiend looked at Dawnruler, who was silent.
Dawnruler knew that Azurefiend’s words made a lot of sense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
himself was a Hegemon; he understood Hegemonic thought-processes
quite clearly. Realmslord Windgrace was such a transcendental figure
that he didn’t get involved in any power squabbles at all. He would
only intervene in situations which were truly lethal for the local
Hegemons! There was no way he would come here just because Ji Ning
was asking these Hegemons and Emperors for a few treasures!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
isn’t asking for that much either. The combined amount from all of
you Hegemons and Emperors is probably comparable to just the networth
of one or two Hegemons,” Hegemon Azurefiend said calmly. “There’s
no way Realmslord Windgrace would be so shameless as to come here for
such a small amount of treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
Enough, Azurefiend. I’ll accept the conditions.” Hegemon
Dawnruler looked at Hegemon Azurefiend, then shook his head. “The
price we are paying is nothing. You, however, are the unluckiest
bastard out of all of us. If there’s anything you need me to help
you out with, just say the word.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
even start.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s eyes flashed with cold light.
He was an incredibly proud figure who had wandered through countless
places. Hegemon Dawnruler’s intentional show of ‘pity’ had
rather angered Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
alright! Calm down. My mistake,” Hegemon Dawnruler said hurriedly.
But when he looked at Azurefiend, he couldn’t help but continue to
sigh secretly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
exalted Hegemon serve as a retainer for a Daolord? Word of this would
quickly spread with wildfire speed! The Hegemons would all spread
this shocking information to their peers, which would then spread
even farther away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Dawnruler obediently handed over the requisite treasures. Hegemon
Wuye and Hegemon Fogsun had long ago publicized within the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance as to what they would need in order to ferry
Hegemons via their realmships. Thus, Ning knew what the price had
been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
swore a lifeblood oath as well, ensuring that Hegemon Dawnruler would
feel at ease. Hegemon Dawnruler’s greatest worry was that once he
began to move, Ning would suddenly activate a mechanism to trap him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Hegemon Oldgem and the Paragon of Swords were
staring in astonishment at Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Azurefiend, you’ve become Daolord Darknorth’s retainer?” As the
conversation progressed, the two Hegemons turned to stare at Hegemon
Azurefiend in absolute astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
with all the fuss? Go ask Dawnruler for the details,” Azurefiend
barked with a frown. “Hurry up! You two are pretty strong, but with
me here it’ll be quite hard for you to defeat all of the mechanisms
and traps present.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine,
fine. We’ll pay.” Hegemon Oldgem nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
Daolord Darknorth.” The Paragon of Swords glanced at Ning. The two
truly were stunned by this. They also understood that with Azurefiend
supporting Ning, there was no way they’d be able to fight through
the flaming passageways by themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Word
quickly spread, causing an utter storm of amazement to sweep through
the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. Many learned the rough details of
what had happened; Hegemon Azurefiend had been trapped within the
flaming passageways, then had lost a bet to Daolord Darknorth and was
thus his retainer for a time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
realmship had been accumulating power as it was preparing to tear
through the Great Dark, but it suddenly came to a halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen.”
Within the realmship, Hegemon Fogsun turned to stare at the other
five Hegemons and the other six Emperors. “You should’ve received
word as well that Daolord Darknorth is in control of the flaming
passageways of the Jadefire Realm! Hegemon Azurefiend was trapped by
him and has now become his retainer. There’s no chance that you’ll
be able to win the realmship from him. What are you planning to do
next? Shall you still go and try your luck?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could something like this have happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Azurefiend really is a disgrace of a Hegemon. He was so afraid of
dying that he chose to go serve a Daolord? How preposterous!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
feel rather ‘impressed’ by Azurefiend. I never would’ve been
able to force myself to bow my head like that. I would’ve rather
died than to swallow such a disgrace.” This was what the Hegemons
and Emperors were all saying amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
they had all paid a price in treasures to board the realmship, and
although it had all come to naught, they didn’t feel too
disappointed. This had been a free-for-all amongst many Hegemons and
Emperors, after all; only one would succeed while the rest would
fail. They had long ago mentally prepared themselves for failure.
Thus, it didn’t really matter now that they really had ended up
empty-handed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
they couldn’t help but sigh with commiseration. Hegemon Azurefiend
was an extremely powerful Hegemon, far more powerful than the vast
majority of them… and yet, he had lowered his head to serve a
Daolord as retainer?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Quite
a few of them actually began to view Azurefiend with contempt,
feeling that he truly was a shameless craven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
we need to decide what the next plan of action is,” Hegemon Fogsun
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
else can we do? We’ve already paid upfront. Are you going to refund
us our treasures?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree. Brother Fogsun, you should refund us half. We haven’t gotten
anything out of this visit,” the five Hegemons and six Emperors all
chorused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cut
the jokes,” Hegemon Fogsun said hurriedly. “You were all lucky!
If you made it in there, you’d probably be threatened and extorted
by Daolord Darknorth as well. You’d probably end up paying even
more!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
enough, enough. Brother Fogsun, we’re already quite close to the
Flamedragon Realmverse, while you need to take the other Hegemons and
Emperors back from the Flamedragon Realmverse. How about this? Let’s
just all head there together and see if there’s a chance for us to
meet Daolord Darknorth. All of us are quite curious about him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Curious? A Daolord who was actually able to convince a Hegemon to be
his retainer… what an audacious fellow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
succeeded, didn’t he?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
because Azurefiend is a coward who fears death! Hmph!” The Hegemons
and Emperors continued to discuss this amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well, then, I’ll continue to head towards the Flamedragon
Realmverse.” Hegemon Fogsun shook his head and sighed. “What a
pity! This was just my second delivery. There were Hegemons and
Emperors in two other realmverses who should’ve been in the third
delivery. There’s no way they are going to pay me now. Jeeze,
Daolord Darknorth… why did you have to be so hasty? Why couldn’t
you have waited until all the Hegemons and Emperors arrived before
making your move?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
time, the only ones to come out a winner were yourself, Wuye, and
Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
all the rest of us suffered huge losses.” The Hegemons and Emperors
continued to drink, chat, and merrymake amongst themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Word
quickly spread. None of the Hegemons and Emperors in the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance harbored any further desires on the realmship.
When they had merely found out that Ning was in charge of the flaming
passageways, they had still felt hope. After all, Ning would have to
hide within the flaming passageways, but a sufficient number of
Hegemons working together while backed by powerful Numerancy would be
able to calculate his location and then capture him safely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
they saw it, all they had to do was to stop him in his tracks. An
entire host of Hegemons and Emperors would be able to kill this
Daolord with ease. Now, however, Hegemon Azurefiend stood by Daolord
Darknorth’s side as his retainer. This meant there was now no
chance at all for them to win the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend
actually became a Daolord’s retainer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
matter how impressive a Daolord is, he’s still just a Daolord.
Azurefiend is a Hegemon!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe what a coward Azurefiend is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
willing to do anything so long as he can stay alive.” This was what
everyone was saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperors
felt an intrinsic sort of superiority towards Daolords. Daolords
simply didn’t live long enough, and there was a limit to how strong
they could become! Hegemons were supreme amongst Emperors… but now,
one of them had become a retainer to a Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
the likes of Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, and Hegemon
Netherlily were stunned by this, despite being very familiar with
Ning. As for the Emperors of the Flamedragon Realmverse, they were
completely stupefied by these rumors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
rumors spread across the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance like wildfire,
then reached out to spread to even more realmverses. This was
considered a fascinating bit of gossip by major powers. As a result,
there were now many major powers in distant realmverses who had never
visited the Flamedragon Realmverse but who had heard of a Daolord
named Darknorth… as well as a Hegemon named Azurefiend who had
actually chosen to be a Daolord’s retainer!</P>

Chapter 24: Meeting Winterflame Again</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued to lead Hegemon Azurefiend and Protector Whitethaw
through the flaming passageways via his realmship, entering
‘negotiations’ with one trapped Hegemon and Emperor after
another. Each flaming passageway was extremely long, while the
Hegemons were all scattered in various places. As a result, it would
take months to fully sweep through all of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Those fools.” Hegemon Azurefiend sat within the realmship, drinking
some wine. A dark look had long ago appeared on his face. “All of
them are saying that I’m afraid of death. Ugh…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend didn’t even know how he was supposed to refute these
rumors. Was he supposed to commit suicide to show that he wasn’t
afraid of death? That would be truly idiotic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Azurefiend, why bother with them?” Ning smiled. “If a dog bites
you, are you really going to bite back? Just let them jabber.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning felt a bit awkward about all this, because the person
Hegemon Azurefiend was serving as himself! There was no way he could
simply ‘give up’ a Hegemonic retainer, and so all he could do was
just try and console the Hegemon as best he could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
they are nothing more than dogs. I shouldn’t waste my time with
them.” Hegemon Azurefiend lifted his head up to drink some wine,
only to realize that his cup was empty. An awkward look appeared on
his face. Clearly, he was so focused on what everyone in the outside
world was saying about him that he hadn’t even noticed he was out
of wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seeing
this, Ning grinned. “Let me fill that up for you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend watched as Ning poured the wine. He couldn’t help but
stroke his pointed, ape-like jaw as he murmured, “I’ve been alive
for many years. I don’t care about what those weaker cultivators
say, but the Hegemons who are on par with me… I can’t help but
care! I’ve made a fool of myself in front of you, Darknorth. My
Dao-heart still is not strong enough.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
long as we are alive, there will be things we care about. Otherwise,
we’d be nothing more than zombies.” Ning smiled. “Caring about
face is quite normal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
there’s something I hope you can do for me.” Hegemon Azurefiend
looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?
Tell me what it is. I’ll do my absolute best,” Ning said
immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope… that you will succeed in the Daomerge!” Azurefiend looked
at Ning, a hint of eagerness in his eyes. Ning couldn’t help but
feel slightly stunned by this. “If you succeed in the Daomerge,
your Omega Dao will ensure that you vastly surpass the level of
Hegemons. You will reach a level which I cannot even imagine. When
that happens, I will only feel proud for having served someone like
yourself as a retainer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally smiled. “Thank you for your kind words. I’ll absolutely
do my best.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daomerge… in truth, Ning was finally daring to feel a bit of
optimism regarding it, primarily because the Autarch’s stone dais
truly was shockingly effective with regards to meditation. He also
had the countless techniques of the Sithe and the cultivator
civilizations which the Autarch had left behind, giving him a much
deeper foundation and level of understanding. Once he created ten
Archon-class techniques, he would then gain another treasure the
Autarch had left behind which would be of tremendous assistance to
cultivators partaking in the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus…
although it would be extremely difficult for a Daolord of the Fourth
Step to succeed in the Daomerge with an Omega Dao, at least he now
had a chance. If he really was able to succeed in the Daomerge, what
new heights would he reach?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors all obediently handed their treasures over. In
the end, even the group of Hegemons led by the Numerancy-focused
Hegemon Blackwood chose to bow their heads and hand over the
treasures. Hegemon Blackwood’s divinations had told them that it
would be impossible for their group to securely leave this place with
Hegemon Azurefiend causing trouble for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons made certain requests of Ning as well. In exchange for
handing over their treasures, they all wanted Ning to swear oaths
guaranteeing their safety. They wanted to make sure that Ning
couldn’t suddenly backstab them as they began to leave. Ning, in
turn, asked the fleeing Hegemons and Emperors to swear oaths not to
come back in the future for revenge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
sides swore the relevant oaths. Only then did each feel faith in the
other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, more than two months had gone by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
one Hegemon left,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
one more left? Who?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Winterflame.”
Ning grinned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Winterflame?” Azurefiend nodded slowly. “He’s an extremely
shameless fellow, but he’s quite strong. He’ll be hard to deal
with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sent the realmship towards the direction of Hegemon Winterflame.
While flying over, Azurefiend suddenly realized that something was
wrong: “Darknorth, why are we going backwards? Aren’t we going to
meet Winterflame?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
we’re moving straight towards him right now,” Ning said.
“Winterflame is located at the very end of this passageway, right
after that turn in the corridor!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
He’s right there? But we went past here earlier. Why didn’t we go
speak to him and instead moved around him? That was unnecessary.”
Azurefiend was puzzled. He didn’t really care about having ‘wasted’
a day or two, but this entire time Ning had ‘swept’ through the
Hegemons and Emperors using the most direct paths possible. Why had
they wasted a day or two on Hegemon Winterflame?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Because
he’s different from the other Hegemons and Emperors,” Ning said
coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What,
is there a feud between the two of you?” Hegemon Azurefiend could
sense a hint of anger emanating from Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “He once assaulted my avatar and tried to abduct my clan,
‘Vastheaven Palace’, to use its disciples as hostages against
me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Winterflame lives up to his reputation. As shameless as ever, I see.”
Hegemon Azurefiend let out a cold snort, then frowned: “If I had a
way to help you get rid of him, I would, but he’s a Hegemon who can
transform into countless flames. So long as his invulnerable
flamebody is active, my attacks will be of no use against him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
might not be able to kill him, but we can’t let him off easily,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
flaming passageways. The handsome, pale-skinned Hegemon Winterflame
was frowning slightly, his skin so crystalline that one could see the
vessels beneath them. “Damn. Daolord Darknorth actually managed to
reverse the situation! Not only did he take control over the
mechanisms in the flaming passageways, he even managed to convince
that idiot Azurefiend to be his retainer. The Hegemons and Emperors
have all given up on fighting for that realmship.” Hegemon
Winterflame frowned, his heart filled with resentment: “What should
I do? What are my options? The flaming passageways are filled with
dangers. I can’t move at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Forget
it. I’ll bow my head and just endure it for now. Escape is the most
pressing issue,” Hegemon Winterflame mused silently. “A pity that
Daolord Darknorth is going to profit by it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
An ancient, rather damaged-looking realmship suddenly flew towards
him from afar. “Here they are.” Hegemon Winterflame raised his
head to stare towards the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship came to a halt, and three figures emerged from it. They
were Ji Ning, Hegemon Azurefiend, and Protector Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Hegemon Winterflame suppressed his anger and said coldly, “Daolord
Darknorth, you really are quite impressive. All these Hegemons came
attacking, but in the end you cleared the board! You even convinced
one of them to become your retainer. I have to admit some admiration
for you. Here are the treasures you requested. I can give them to
you, but I need you to swear an oath not to attack me while I leave
the Jadefire Realm. I must be allowed to leave in peace.” Hegemon
Winterflame held out a bracelet as he looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Winterflame. We meet again.” Ning finally spoke out in a leisurely
voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Meet
again?” Hegemon Winterflame was briefly startled before his face
went blank and hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
told you that we’d meet again here in the Jadefire Realm.” Ning
smiled. “I’ve always been a person who keeps his word. I’ve had
you on my mind for quite some time now, ever since you attempted to
take away all of Vastheaven Palace to try and threaten me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame growled, “What do you want?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other Hegemons only needed to pay a minor figure in treasure, but you
are different,” Ning said. “I won’t claim your life. However,
if you wish me to let me go then you must give me all the treasures
you are currently carrying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
won’t claim my life? As if you could.” Hegemon Winterflame was
rather angry. In terms of raw power, most likely only Otherverse
Lords had any chance of slaying him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can choose to refuse.” Ning looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
Hegemon Winterflame stared hard at Ning. “You ask too much. Half!
I’ll give you half of the countless treasures I’ve accumulated
over the aeons.” He was legendary for his shamelessness, but it was
this very shamelessness that had allowed to build up such a
prodigious stockpile of treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Either
accept my offer or decline it,” Ning said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
Hegemon Winterflame was so furious, his teeth hurt from all the
clenching. Still… when he considered his situation, he realized
that all the other Hegemons and Emperors had fled. The Jadefire Realm
was simply too dangerous; the only person in all the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance who would be able to come here to save him was
Realmslord Windgrace. But not only did Realmslord Windgrace rarely
intervene in matters like this, the Realmslord didn’t even like
him. The two weren’t on very good terms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine!
Take them!!!” Hegemon Winterflame had a rather savage look on his
face as the bracelet in his hand trembled slightly. Clearly, he had
just moved many treasures into that bracelet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
already told you… I want ALL of your treasures.” Ning looked at
him. “The armor that you are wearing and the Universe weapon you
are wielding… give them to me as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
even want my armor and my weapon?!” Hegemon Winterflame’s eyes
bulged out.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_025__Flam"></A>
Chapter 25: Time Flows Like Water, the Three Realms Perish</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
cultivators, their weapons and their armor were their most valuable
possessions. Generally speaking, when cultivators spoke of ‘trading
treasures’ or ‘handing over treasures’, they were excluding the
weapons and armor which they normally used! A Universe weapon which
acknowledged you and was a good fit for you… such a treasure was
incredibly hard to find. And how much blood and effort would have to
be poured into a suit of Lifeblood armor, allowing it to grow over
the aeons?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Other
treasures might be valuable, but the loss of them would not have too
much of an impact on Hegemon Winterflame’s actual level of power.
It would’ve hurt, but he would’ve bit his tongue and accepted.
His weapons and his armor? Once those were lost, his power would
dramatically drop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
I want both.” Ning looked at him. “I want all of your treasures!
You must hand over every last drop of chaos nectar and every last
chaos jewel, to say nothing of your Universe treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-y-you…!”
Hegemon Winterflame was absolutely livid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you handing them over or not?” Ning looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible!
How could I give you my armaments?” Hegemon Winterflame glared
furiously at Ning. “I’ve already lowered my head before you, but
you push me too far. Hmph. Do you really think I’m afraid of you? I
can simply sit in this tunnel without moving, and your control over
the mechanisms will be of no use to you. There can’t be that many
which are capable of actually trapping and/or killing Hegemons. I
refuse to believe one of them is right next to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing you can do to me! If push comes to shove, I’ll just stay
here for 108,000 chaos cycles. Let’s see if you’ll survive past
that date!” Hegemon Winterflame glared at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. If I fail my Daomerge and perish, I’ll pass the control
techniques over to others and require them to swear oaths to never
release you,” Ning said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
let us wait and see!” Hegemon Winterflame’s face was ruddy with
rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Excellent.
Honestly, I don’t even care about your piddling treasures. Brother
Azurefiend, let’s go.” Ning turned and immediately walked towards
his realmship. Azurefiend smirked coldly as he glanced at
Winterflame, then joined Whitethaw in walking towards the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
you aren’t worthy of looking down upon me, you craven. No matter
how ‘shameless’ I am, I, Winterflame, would never lower myself to
becoming a retainer to a Daolord,” Winterflame said mockingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Winterflame…
by my decree, you shall be trapped here forever until the day you
perish!” Ning came to a halt, turned and said these words, then
entered the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
see if I die first or if you die first!” Hegemon Winterflame roared
angrily, watching as the three disappeared into the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
Winterflame’s completely shameless. He’s capable of saying
anything at all. Don’t waste your time with him.” Hegemon
Azurefiend smiled coldly. “Just enjoy the sight of his perpetual
imprisonment.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
storm caused by the news that a Daolord had acquired a realmship
gradually became to calm down. However, the news that a Hegemon had
actually chosen to serve a Daolord as a retainer was slowly spread to
ever more distant realmverses and otherverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
core of this formation-diagram is ridiculously complicated.” Ning’s
divine power clone was still above the altar, carefully analyzing it.
Ning’s Primaltwin was still on the Autarch’s stone dais in the
Azureflower Estate, meditating on the formation-diagram as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
core of the formation-diagram… it required one to have reached
incredible heights in the Dao of Fire and the Dao of Space, as well
as extreme mastery of the Dao of Formations. Only then would you have
a chance to solve it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse returned to its usual calm, and time slowly
began to flow on. One chaos cycle, two chaos cycles, three chaos
cycles…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
in Ning’s homeland of the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">CRACK!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden-robed Ning was by the side of his daughter Brightmoon. The two
were aboard a rowboat floating atop Serpentwing Lake. The
golden-robed Ning raised his head to stare at the heavens. He saw a
bolt of lightning tear through the skies, spanning trillions of
kilometers in size. This bolt of lightning didn’t just pierce
through the Grand Xia, it also pierced through the majority of the
three thousand major worlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms are finally about to face the apocalypse,” Ning
murmured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?”
Brightmoon was stunned. She stared at her father, shock apparent in
her bright eyes. “Father, did you just say that the Three Realms
are about to be destroyed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded. “Normal chaosworlds will only last for a single chaos
cycle. After being destroyed, they will coalesce into ‘Worldhearts’
that will then give birth to a new world and a new cycle of life.
Long ago, Mother Nuwa led our Three Realms to defeat the Seamless
Chaosworld. A total of nine chaos cycles have gone by since then.
Nine! This represents an absolute limit. It is indeed time for the
Three Realms to be destroyed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should we do? Should we move to stop it?” Brightmoon asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
should we? Destruction and rebirth are all part of a cycle, the
natural functioning of the Chaosverse.” Ning smiled. “And the
major powers of the Three Realms have long ago established their own
chaosworlds. We’ll simply relocate Swallow Mountain to one of
them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Brightmoon nodded. These days, experts were as common as clouds in
the Three Realms. It had a decent number of even Samsara Daolords.
Ever since Ning had brought back the three hundred-plus Hegemonic
legacies to the Three Realms, it had undergone yet another golden
age. Its cultivators had exploded with power, and the rate at which
the Three Realms gave birth to experts was even more ridiculously
high than for the planet within the Stone Hellephant Wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the primordial chaos outside the Three Realms. There was a region
here that was tens of thousands of times vaster than the Three Realms
themselves, and chaosworlds were scattered throughout this region in
accordance with an incredibly complicated formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were a total of 3900 chaosworlds here, and they were linked together
in a massive formation which Ning had developed based on his insights
into the Dao of Formations. The Sithe discs had been emplaced within
the formation, becoming part of it! Ever since Ning began to truly
analyze the Sithe formations, he finally began to be able to make
perfect use of the Sithe discs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power of the formations and the Sithe discs was such that it would be
extremely hard for even Hegemons to breach the local defenses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Over
the course of countless years, the three thousand-plus chaosworlds
had given birth to countless living beings. As a result, the denizens
of the Three Realms had truly thrived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
there it goes.” Many figures stood there within the void, staring
towards the distant Three Realms. The golden-robed Ning, Subhuti, and
Windfiend stood at the front of this group. Ning was the number one
expert of the Three Realms; that went without saying. Subhuti and
Windfiend were incredibly talented as well; after having analyzed
over three hundred Hegemonic legacies, they had merged multiple
Supreme Daos together and become Samsara Daolords. By now, both
Subhuti and Windfiend were both Daolords of the Third Step.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Maitreya,
Crazy Ji, Sun Wukong, Jade Cauldron, Kuafu… a total of nineteen had
become Samsara Daolords. However, none of them had been able to fuse
multiple Supreme Daos together. Maitreya was one of the more
impressive ones, having at least mastered a single Supreme Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for World-level cultivators? They were ridiculously abundant. There
were over ten thousand of them by now! Even Brightmoon had been able
to train to the World level under her own power. Alas, Ning’s
father and mother were much weaker when it came to cultivation. Even
though Ning personally guided them, they still weren’t able to
reach the World level. In the end, Ning had to rely on using
medicines to forcibly uplift both his father and his mother to the
World level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms is in a golden age. We have over ten thousand
World-level cultivators, which is just slightly less than the
Badlands Territory itself. However, we have far more Samsara Daolords
than the Badlands Territory.” Subhuti sighed emotionally. “The
more I wander the outside world, the more I feel that the Three
Realms are truly incredible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded. “However, the Chaosverse is a vast place. There are
more than a few other locations which have given place to a high
density of experts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
techniques which Darknorth brought back were of great help as well.
On average, the cultivators of the Three Realms have all risen by a
complete level,” Windfiend said. “Otherwise… there’s no way
we would have this many Samsara Daolords, while Subhuti and I
probably wouldn’t have fused Supreme Daos together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed with this assessment. A good reservoir of techniques was
extremely important, which was why the Aeonians viewed those three
hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies as priceless treasures. Alas, Ning
was now so powerful that the Aeonians didn’t even dare to voice a
word in protest. All they could do was pretend that none of it had
ever happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Three Realms was slowly collapsing. One world after another
began to crumble as the rivers and the mountains began to break
apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the major powers who had been born from the Three Realms all
watched from afar, their hearts filled with emotions. However, all of
them were at peace, because they had already relocated everyone and
everything they cared about away from the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick,
look over there! The new Worldheart is beginning to take form.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Worldheart of the Three Realms.” The various Daolords and
World-level cultivators were all chatting amongst themselves. Ning
watched intently as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast Three Realms continued to collapse until its very core became an
invisible black hole that devoured everything in its path. All of the
shattered bits of world-rubble were all drawn into that invisible
hole, causing it to slowly stabilize and become solid. An invisible
surge of power began to spread out from it, causing even Ning to feel
a vague sense of awe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the power of the very essence of the Chaosverse itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has finally taken form. Is that over there the new Worldheart of the
Three Realms?” Ning stared from afar. The Three Realms had already
completely vanished, leaving behind a pair of glittering gemstones
that were embedded into each other. Normally, Worldhearts were
supposed to consist of a single, perfect gem. However, the Worldheart
of the Three Realms was very unique, as it was formed from the
collision of those two chaosworlds. Both gems had been damaged and
lost certain parts, but each just so happened to compensate for the
losses of the other, allowing the two to form a perfect whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
embedded double-Worldheart was dazzlingly beautiful and absolutely
marvelous. Ning had never seen a Worldheart like this before. “How
beautiful.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh in praise.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_026__Flam"></A>
Chapter 26: The Complete Seven Flaming Hells</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the Worldheart of our Three Realms? I’ve never seen one as
beautiful as this one,” Subhuti said as he sighed in astonishment,
staring intently at the Worldheart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has a special magnetism to it, as though it is filled with infinite
vitality and possibilities.” The nearby Windfiend nodded in
amazement as well, an intoxicated look flashing through his eyes.
“Every single ray of light coming from that gem is absolutely
beautiful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning nodded slowly as well. All three of them were incredibly
talented figures. Ning’s experiences went without saying; just
think about how much treasure he had forced the Hegemons and Emperors
to hand over within the Jadefire Realm! He had seen all types of
treasures by now. Subhuti and Windfiend were now incredibly talented
Daolords of the Third Step who were on the same level of power that
Ninedust had been when Ning and Ninedust had battled for the first
time. All of them were highly experienced figures… and all three of
them were truly stunned by how beautiful the Worldheart was. It was
completely different from other Worldhearts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
should be the reason why our Three Realms has given birth to
cultivators of such incredible power,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
how extraordinary the Worldheart is, the chaosworld born from it will
naturally be extraordinary as well.” Subhuti smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
us see what the ‘new Three Realms’ will end up looking like,”
Windfiend agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
slowly flowed on. Ning, Subhuti, Windfiend, and the other major
powers all continued to watch silently as the Worldheart continued
its transformation. The Worldheart slowly melted away, its power
dispersing into nine thousand different parts, with a much smaller
remnant core left behind where the original Worldheart had been. This
was the largest of the nine thousand ‘pieces’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">36,000
years went past. 9000 Gods and Fiends of Primordial Chaos were born.
These Fiendgods were at different levels of power based on how much
of the Worldheart’s power they had each absorbed. The weakest were
merely at the Empyrean God level, while the strongest was the
Fiendgod born from the remnant core that looked like a miniature
Worldheart. This one was born at the World level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
World-level Fiendgod was born with such overwhelming power that the
other Fiendgods didn’t dare to approach him. This caused him to
feel great loneliness, and on one day he rose to his feet and lifted
his hands up, using them to tear through the primordial chaos and
establish a vast chaosworld around him. His body began to grow in
size as he poured all of his energy into sustaining and strengthening
this chaosworld, making it grow as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Chaos Fiendgod should be even stronger than Pangu once was.”
Subhuti stood off in the distance, watching as the new Three Realms
were born. This was his evaluation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Pangu
was once the most powerful of the Chaos Fiendgods of the Pangu
Chaosworld, but the Pangu Chaosworld’s Worldheart was merely a
single unblemished gem,” Windfiend said. “The new Three Realms
are different. Its Worldheart was formed from the collision and
merger of the Worldhearts of the Seamless Chaosworld and the Pangu
Chaosworld. It only makes sense for it to give birth to a Chaos
Fiendgod who is stronger than even Pangu.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
once he establishes Heaven and Earth, he shall die.” Ning couldn’t
help but sigh when he saw this. That incredibly powerful Chaos
Fiendgod was being guided by invisible laws; its very existence was
for the sake of establishing this chaosworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
the Chaos Fiendgod died of exhaustion… but he had already
completely established an incredibly vast new chaosworld! The old
Three Realms had been shattered into countless pieces, but the new
Three Realms was a perfect whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Fiendgods warred across the new Three Realms for supremacy, and all
sorts of new lifeforms were born. More and more mortal lifeforms
emerged, and eventually cultivation techniques were invented which
allowed them to embark upon the path of cultivation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
new Three Realms, as a fairly extraordinary type of chaosworld, was
destined to live a fairly long life. Two chaos cycles went past, but
it remained extremely stable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Odd.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
we haven’t taken too heavy a hand in guiding the new Three Realms,
we have left behind many legacies in the void around it. We’ve even
accepted some of the most talented cultivators of the new Three
Realms into our tutelage, and have transmitted our most precious
techniques to them. Why is it that not a single one of them has been
able to fuse multiple Supreme Daos together?” Subhuti, Windfiend,
and Ning were having another get-together. Suhbuti was quite puzzled
by the state of the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly as well. “I noticed it as well. It seems as though,
compared to the old Three Realms, the cultivators of the new Three
Realms have on the whole a lower level of potential! However, they
are still quite impressive compared to the outside world.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
secretly guided the new Three Realms for two chaos cycles, allowing
it to give birth to more than a hundred World-level cultivators.
There are no Samsara Daolords yet, but this is still an impressive
haul.” Windfiend smiled. “To be honest, we had to undergo a
process of slowly increasing our power as well. Prior to the Pangu
Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld colliding, Subhuti and I
weren’t all that strong! It was when faced with the threat of
annihilation that I suddenly had an epiphany which allowed my flying
speed to surpass the limits of the Heavenly Daos. Once the ‘Three
Realms Era’ began, Subhuti and I began to grow much more powerful
as we spent more time training. His mastery Dao of Spacetime became
even more unfathomable, while I learned to more perfectly merge
‘Wind’ and ‘Space’ together. More time had to pass, followed
by you bestowing us with those incredible techniques, before we truly
rose to power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. As his own level of insight increased, he began to gain a
better sense of attunement towards the future and towards fate. Ning
now had the feeling that the ‘Three Realms Era’ that came about
as a result of the collision between the Pangu Chaosworld and the
Seamless Chaosworld would be the most powerful era for the Three
Realms. The later generations would all be significantly weaker, and
not even the most supreme of legacies would change that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly revealed a look of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems Darknorth just received some good news.” Windfiend smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
just found the way to rescue a good friend of mine,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Terror Starsea. The Jadefire Realm. The hidden control room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
divine power calm remained seated above the altar, staring downwards
at the enormous flower-shaped ‘Seven Flaming Hells
formation-diagram’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
training for over a thousand accelerated chaos cycles, I’ve finally
gained mastery over this formation-diagram.” Ning was absolutely
delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
had been an extremely difficult task. To fully unlock the
formation-diagram, one needed to have reached extremely profound
levels of insight into the Dao of Space and the Dao of Fire… and of
course, the Dao of Formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
Ning had first spent quite a bit of time analyzing the Dao of Fire.
Fire and water mutually opposed each other but also reinforced each
other. Ning thus chose to spend some time on the Dao of Water as
well, so as to more quickly and thoroughly understand the Dao of
Fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took Ning a full chaos cycle to reach the Archon-level in the Dao of
Water, even with the aid of the Autarch’s stone! As for the Dao of
Fire, it took three entire chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
Ning focused on ‘space’. Ning wasn’t really talented in this
regard, and ‘space’ was an incredibly difficult Dao to
comprehend. While focusing on the Dao of Space, Ning also spent part
of his time analyzing the Dao of Lightning, because he discovered
that the Dao of Lightning was intimately connected to the Dao of
Space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was quite skilled in the Dao of Lightning. It took him only two chaos
cycles for him to reach the Archon level in this Dao. Only after
finishing his work on the Dao of Lightning did he focus all of his
attention on the Dao of Space once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took him more than two hundred accelerated chaos cycles before he was
able to create an Archon-level technique pertaining to the Dao of
Space!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
he had reached sufficient heights in both fire and space. Ning turned
all of his attention to the art of formations itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Formations was an extremely complicated and awesome Dao. Ning
spent more than eight hundred chaos cycles in accelerated time before
he was finally able to reach a high enough level that he could
understand how the Seven Flaming Hells’ formation-diagram worked!
Thankfully, Ning had access to the many Sithe formation records which
Autarch Awakener had left behind. Those techniques had included many
descriptions on them, allowing Ning understand their fundamental
principles and then take control over the formation-diagram.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao of Formations truly is insanely difficult.” Ning was
speechless. “I had the Autarch’s stone dais helping me out, but I
still spent over eight hundred accelerated chaos cycles working on
it! If I didn’t have the stone dais, I could’ve spent a thousand
times as much time in training without being able to succeed. In
other words, there would’ve been no chance that I would’ve been
able to finish mastering it during my 108,000.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a bit celebratory. Thank goodness he had the Autarch’s stone
dais! That was why he had ‘only’ spent eight hundred chaos cycles
to solve the Seven Flaming Hells formation-diagram.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was proof that it was best for Daolords to focus on their areas of
expertise. Ning was skilled in the Dao of the Sword, and so he
trained in it quite quickly. He was also skilled in water and
thunder, and thus he trained fairly quickly in those two Daos as
well. Fire was a bit slower, while space had been ridiculous; it took
him two hundred chaos cycles to reach the Archon level in it. As for
the Dao of Formations? That went without saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
me to have found the Autarch’s stone dais was a stroke of
tremendous luck. Oh, Ninedust… you have no idea how lucky you are
as well, to be able to make it out of this place.” Ning chortled.
He really was delighted! After spending over a thousand chaos cycles
in total, he had finally solved the Seven Flaming Hells
formation-diagram. This sense of excitement and accomplishment truly
was joyful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me see if I can control it all.” Ning’s divine power clone stared
downwards, sending out a tendril of its will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the enormous flower-like diagram of the Seven Flaming Hells began to
light up. Countless shadow images appeared throughout the hidden
control room, and the images represented the entire Jadefire Realm!
Every single flaming passageway and prison appeared, all of them
under Ning’s control. He was now able to activate any prison cell
with but a thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s divine power clone suddenly narrowed its eyes, turning to
stare at the very center of the Jadefire Realm projection. There was
actually another hidden region located directly beneath the prison
region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
ANOTHER secret region?” Ning frowned.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_027__Flam"></A>
Chapter 27: Flamewing God</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
hidden control room at the very center of the prison region was meant
to control the formation-diagram which governed the entire Jadefire
Realm. What, then, was this second hidden room directly beneath the
prisons meant for?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Turn!”
Ji Ning sent out a strand of his will, causing the entire outer layer
of the Jadefire Realm to rumble as it began to turn and swivel. Every
single prison cell began to swivel as well as it switched to a new
configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
I thought. This hidden room is actually the energy source for the
entire Jadefire Realm.” Ning revealed a smile. How was it that the
many mechanisms of the Jadefire Realm had been maintained for so
long? Where did that energy come from? Although the Jadefire Realm
was able to absorb energy from the outside world, it must be
remembered that the Jadefire Realm was once capable of unleashing
unleashing a Decimatus Wave of terrifying power. There was no way
that the amount of energy absorbed from the outside world alone would
be enough to unleash such an attack; it had to have an internal
energy source to do this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning discovered the second hidden room, he immediately
surmised that it had to be the energy source for the Jadefire Realm.
When he tested ‘turning’ the Jadefire Realm, he immediately
discovered that energy began to flow out from that hidden room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
sort of energy well is capable of unleashing a ‘Decimatus Wave’?”
Ning was rather intrigued and curious about this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
realmship was parked peacefully in the air at the center of the
Jadefire Realm’s prison region. The white-robed Ning was seated
atop a prayer mat in the lotus position, silently meditating. As for
Azurefiend, in his boredom he was drinking and eating by himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
going to make a short trip,” Ning said as he opened his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
other Hegemons come?” Azurefiend asked, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
We’re going to another part of the prisons,” Ning said. He was
going to go check out the hidden room first, then save Ninedust;
Ninedust had already waited for quite some time, a few more minutes
wouldn’t kill him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
The realmship quickly began to descend through the prison region.
After flying for a full hour, it reached a region of absolute empty
darkness at the very bottom of the prison region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Open
up.” Ning was in control of the Seven Flaming Hells
formation-diagram. With but a thought, he caused the hidden room to
open up before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A giant red copper gate suddenly appeared in the darkness and slowly
began to open. As it did, a surge of blasting heat swept out from the
other side, causing the void in the surrounding area to twist and
distort like steam.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was able to see the blazing heat and fire on the other side of the
red copper gate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ohoho!”
Hegemon Azurefiend was quite excited. He said with a laugh, “I
thought that the Jadefire Realm was already quite a hot place, given
the many flames which fill its passageways… but there’s no way to
compare those flames with this place. Let me out of the ship, I want
to go take a look and see just how hot those flames are. They
actually have caused space to twist and distort!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
With but a thought, Ning put away the realmship. Ning, Azurefiend,
and Whitethaw all stood there in the emptiness of the void. The
realmship gone, they could now directly sense the waves of heat which
washed across them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
hot.” Ning felt as though he had been dropped into a cauldron of
fire. It was so hot that he couldn’t help but tense up, but his
body was naturally capable of enduring this level of heat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
heat wave alone would reduce Daolords of the Second Step to dust in a
flash.” Hegemon Azurefiend smiled. “Let’s go in and take a
look.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
let me go inside first,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. In terms of survivability, the Sithe Protector was
probably superior to even Hegemon Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Whitethaw immediately flew through the giant red copper gate. Once he
did, a look of disbelief appeared on his simple face. He then turned
his head and called backwards, “Master, you can come inside. It’s
very hot in here, but it won’t be of any danger to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
we’re coming in as well,” Ning said. Azurefiend, however, still
took the lead in charging through the gate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Swoosh. The two passed through the giant red copper gate. With but a
thought, Ning closed the gate behind them once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
As soon as Ning flew in, he was stunned by what he saw before him.
The ground was pitch-black in color; Ning immediately recognized it
as being deepfire blackstone. Far off in the distance, there was an
enormous winged beast that was a hundred kilometers in size which was
bathed in flames. The creature’s entire body was fiery red, and it
had a pair of dazzling and enormous wings on its back. Its body
looked somewhat similar to that of a fiery red bear’s, but it was
completely covered with countless flaming scales.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Whoosh! A deep sound rumbled across the area. It was the sound of
this beast snoring in its slumber.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Its
fort short legs were covered with black chains, while its wings were
wrapped in chains as well. These six black chains extended off into
the void, while a large amount of flames was being slowly drawn
through the chains into the void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
flames covering its body formed a rhythmic series of heat waves that
swept out in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
flames it is generating unconsciously while it sleeps is hot enough
to cause the temperature in the area to be so high as to instantly
wipe out Daolords of the Second Step.” Hegemon Azurefiend was
rather stunned. “The actual flames themselves have to be several
levels higher in power; they could probably wipe out ordinary Eternal
Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
in slumber, its flames possess such power? What type of beast is
this?!” Ning was rather stunned as well. He had thought that the
energy well for the Jadefire Realm would be something akin to a
sparrowfiend gem. Who would’ve thought that it would actually be a
living creature?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
that be a Chaos Primordial?” Hegemon Azurefiend suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Chaos Primordial?” Ning was stunned. Chaos Primordials were the
most terrifying lifeforms of the Chaosverse, birthed from the prime
essences of the Chaosverse themselves. They were born with virtually
indestructible bodies, and they possessed inconceivable levels of
power. However, they were rather unintelligent, perhaps comparable to
ordinary mortal children at best. They wandered the Chaosverse alone,
and when they occasionally ran into a realmverse they would devour
the entire realmverse whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a result, quite a few realmverses had been destroyed by Chaos
Primordials over the course of aeons! Alas, there was nothing that
could be done; even terrifying Otherverse Lords would only at best be
able to stay alive in the face of a Chaos Primordial attack. There
was nothing which could stop them save the Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
if a major power like Realmslord Windgrace ran into a Chaos
Primordial which was devouring a realmverse, he would have no choice
but to just watch powerlessly as it all happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials love to eat verdant azuresouls.” This thought suddenly
came to Ning’s mind. He had acquired a verdant azuresoul from that
beastworld, one which Autarch Bolin had transformed into a magic
treasure. So long as a Chaos Primordial ate it, it would fall under
Ning’s control and become his servant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has to be a Chaos Primordial, right? I can’t think of any other
creature that would be this powerful.” Hegemon Azurefiend wasn’t
certain either, because he had never encountered a Chaos Primordial
before either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
that is a Chaos Primordial. It called itself the ‘Flamewing God’,”
the nearby Protector Whitethaw suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing
God?” Ning and Azurefiend both turned to look at Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Whitethaw nodded. “Prior to the Dawn War, when the Sithe were in
the prime of their power, they discovered this Chaos Primordial. Some
of the most terrifying and powerful Sithe experts set off to capture
it, then imprisoned it within an enormous Sithe prison that was meant
for imprisoning major powers. I once entered that place with my
master and saw the ‘Flamewing God’ myself. Back then, one of the
prison gaolers introduced it to us and said that it was incredibly
strong. Three Sithe Exalts had to work together in order to capture
it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Having chatted with Whitethaw in the past, he knew that the
most powerful members of the Sithe race had been the ones known as
the ‘Exalts’. They were far more powerful than even the
Otherverse Lords of the cultivator civilizations! But of course, they
still were far from being a match for the Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
most powerful experts on the side of the cultivators had been the
Autarchs, and it was the Autarchs who had led them to victory in
exterminating the Sithe and their Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t expect for the Flamewing God to have been brought here,”
Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sighed in approval. To use a Chaos Primordial as an energy source…
no wonder the Jadefire Realm had been so terrifying in its prime!
Every single Decimatus Wave was capable of annihilating anything
below the Autarch level of power with ease. This was something that
was even more terrifying than a Chaos Primordial itself, and it was
thanks to the power of the formation that drew from its energies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
the six chains binding it…” Ning stared from afar. The six chains
ensured that this powerful Chaos Primordial was unable to fight back,
and it also drew energy from it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems to be some sort of suppressive formation that also has energy
absorption effects.” Ning scrutinized the six chains intently,
studying the countless runes and patterns that covered them. He was
now a grandmaster of the Dao of Formations, but he still found this
formation to be quite complicated. This was because Ning’s path was
that of the Seven Flaming Hells formation-diagram, while these chains
belonged to a completely different school of formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’ll
be a bit tough to break these chains and release this Chaos
Primordial… but given my skills in the Dao of Formations as well as
the records regarding Sithe formations which Autarch Awakener left
behind, I still have a chance to succeed,” Ning mused. “However…
prior to releasing this creature, I should first have it eat the
verdant azuresoul.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
only had a single verdant azuresoul. Ning was worried that if he
tossed it out, the Flamewing God might just slap it apart into dust.
That would be troublesome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the slumbering Flamewing God suddenly stretched its wings, causing
the black chains covering it to clatter. It opened its fiery red
eyes, staring angrily at the distant trio.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all felt a sense of invisible pressure.
They hurriedly retreated, while Whitethaw moved to stand in front of
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
three keep on babbling on and on in front of me. This is starting to
piss me off. How am I supposed to sleep like this?” The Flamewing
God’s ursine face was filled with rage.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_028__Flam"></A>
Chapter 28: Flames</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God’s entire body was rippling with flames, but its gaze
was a bit distant, almost as though it hadn’t completely woken up
yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fuck
off and don’t bother me,” the Flamewing God barked irritably. But
then, its blurry gaze suddenly focused and narrowed as it glared
intently at the Sithe Protector, Whitethaw, standing in front of Ji
Ning. The scales on the creature’s body seemed to stand up, and its
gaze became filled with rage as it ground out the word: “SITHE!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Azurefiend paled as he hurriedly moved to stand in front of
Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Master!” Whitethaw had a solemn look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The Flamewing God moved to charge forwards, sweeping out with its
giant paws. Its massive bear-shaped body was filled with such power
that a wave of terrifying pressure was generated by the most basic of
movements. All spacetime ripples came to a complete, frozen halt.
Ning even felt as though his thinking speed had turned sluggish, and
an inexplicable sense of fear filled his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The six black chains around the Flamewing God instantly
began to tighten from the strain. The charging Flamewing God was
instantly pulled back into its original position by the power of the
chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GRWAAAAAH!”
The Flamewing God let out a frustrated howl, furiously struggling to
break free. Its wings were fluttering, and its entire body was
trembling. The six black chains clanked furiously, but no matter how
hard the creature tried to struggle the chains didn’t suffer the
slightest bit of damage. The Sithe had put quite a bit of effort into
building these chains and ensuring that this place would be able to
draw from this Chaos Primordial’s energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
you, Sithe! Damn you! Damn you! You’ve once more appeared before
me, you damned Sithe!” The Flamewing God’s eyes were bloodshot
with absolutely berserk rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Azurefiend both let out sighs of relief. “Thank goodness those
chains are binding it. Otherwise, we would’ve been in serious
danger.” Ning still felt a sense of fear. Chaos Primordials were
terrifying creatures that were capable of devouring entire
realmverses with ease. Even Otherverse Lords were unable to defeat
them; they would at most be able to survive the creatures with
difficulty. If Hegemon Azurefiend was to actually attempt to battle
one, the end result would be him being smashed to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Too
terrifying. A mere wave of its claws caused me to feel as though I
was in mortal danger,” Hegemon Azurefiend said with some lingering
fear. “In the past, I’ve only heard of these creatures; I’ve
never seen one of them in person. Now, I finally understand just how
terrifying Chaos Primordials are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
let your guard down, Master.” The Sithe Protector continued to
stand protectively in front of Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
furious howls of the still-struggling Flamewing God echoed throughout
the entire hidden region. Suddenly, it opened its mouth and spat out
a ball of dark-red fire. The fire shot through the air and swept out
to encompass all three of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good!” Ning instantly felt a sense of nervousness. His subconscious
was screaming to him that he was in danger, letting him know that
even a supremely talented Daolord like himself would immediately
perish if he let that dark-red fire touch him! Not even his
invulnerable form would be able to save him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whitethaw’s body suddenly expanded dramatically in size as his body
seemed to liquefy, allowing him to transform to become a giant metal
barrier that completely covered Ning and Hegemon Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh!
The dark-red flames swept over every inch of the golem, but the
barrier-shaped Whitethaw was able to block out every single flame.
The fire continued to blaze away against him, but he was able to
endure it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whitethaw,”
Azurefiend called out, “Are you going to be able to hold on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. These flames cannot harm me.” Whitethaw’s voice echoed
inside the protected region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
impressive!” Azurefiend sighed in amazement. “Sithe Protectors
truly are incredible. There’s no way we cultivators can compare to
you golems in terms of toughness. Although I have a formidable divine
body, I wouldn’t dare to make the claim that I could face those
flames and be completely unscathed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded and smiled. “Any halfway-decent golem is comparable to
top-grade Eternal treasures, while my own body is currently only
comparable to high-grade Eternal treasures at best. As for Whitethaw…
he is a Protector golem designed and created by the Sithe, an
extraordinary golem that is both tough and flexible. It is very
difficult to damage him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Whitethaw’s voice echoed within the barrier once more. “If the
Flamewing God wasn’t chained down, it’d probably be able to rip
me apart with ease, given how strong it is. But since it thankfully
is chained down… if all it has is these flames, it won’t be able
to harm me at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared through the semi-translucent metallic barrier towards the
distant Flamewing God. The Flamewing God was clearly still in a
berserk state as it continued to furiously belch out those terrifying
flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
creature had the power to annihilate entire realmverses with ease,
and even its flaming breath was enough to inspire dread in Hegemons.
It took three Sithe Exalts, the most powerful members of the Sithe
race, working together to capture it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an irritable creature. It seems it truly does hate the Sithe,” Ning
mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God continued to belch fire for a full hour before coming
to a halt after realizing that it wasn’t damaging the barrier in
the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whitethaw returned to his normal form and reappeared next to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
remember you, you Sithe!” The Flamewing God bellowed once more as
it glared intently at Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait
a moment!” Ning hurriedly called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Only then did the Flamewing God turn its attention towards Ning and
Hegemon Azurefiend. “A cultivator? A cultivator who serves the
Sithe?” The Flamewing God seemed to grow even angrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing
God, the Sithe were wiped out countless aeons ago,” Ning said
hurriedly. “After the Sithe were defeated, their treasures and
relics fell into the hands of our cultivator civilizations. As for
this Protector golem, it fell into my hands and is now my servant. I
have no connection to the Sithe at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe? Wiped out?” The Flamewing God was startled, a look of
puzzlement within its narrowed eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once,
it had lived a carefree life of freedom… but then a nightmare had
descended out of nowhere. Three Sithe experts had appeared, and they
were simply far too powerful. The Flamewing God had sought to fight
back, but the three worked together to capture it. From that day
forth, it had lost its freedom! In the end, it had been imprisoned
here and every so often its energy would be extracted. Although it
was not very intelligent, it would never forget the hatred it felt
towards the Sithe. When it saw Whitethaw, it immediately recognized
the golem. Its intelligence level was low, but its memory was
perfect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
wiped out. The Sithe have already been wiped out,” Ning said
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wiped
out ages ago. Haven’t you noticed that you’ve been sleeping for
an extremely long period of time without any Sithe bothering you?”
Hegemon Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Uh…”
The Flamewing God blinked. “I really did take a very, very long nap
this time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been a long time since those six chains have drained a significant
amount of your flames, right?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right!”
The Flamewing God’s eyes turned round with surprise as it nodded
seriously, then gave the black chains binding it a hateful glare.
“Long, long ago, these chains would constantly drain large amounts
of my flames. Each time, they would drain so much that I would feel
extremely miserable. But ever since that last nap I took… it is
true that they haven’t drained anything from me for quite some
time. And now, two cultivators come to visit me… does this mean the
Sithe truly have been wiped out?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
really have been wiped out,” Ning and Azurefiend said
simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
the Sithe were really powerful. There’s no way they would’ve been
wiped out that easily,” the Flamewing God mumbled to itself. Having
suffered quite a bit at the hands of the Sithe, it continued to
harbor a healthy dread of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Azurefiend were both cultivators, and so the Flamewing God didn’t
feel much enmity towards them. Although it had been quite some time
since any Sithe had come to visit it, the creature still harbored
doubts about whether or not the Sithe truly had been wiped out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
sit and chat, Azurefiend.” Ning suddenly waved his hand, causing
two wine-laden tables to appear before them. Ning sat down before one
of the tables.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was rather puzzled. Why did Ning suddenly want to eat and drink?
Still, Azurefiend was a bit of a glutton to begin with, and so he
didn’t complain. He immediately sat down in front of his own table
and picked up a large haunch of meat with one hand and a goblet of
wine in the other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
why did you suddenly want to feast?” Azurefiend said while munching
away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
spent chaos cycles meditating on formations. It’s been ages since
I’ve had anything nice,” Ning said. He then smiled as he glanced
off into the distance: “Flamewing, you need anything to eat or
drink?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
real goal right now wasn’t to eat or drink… it was to tame this
Flamewing God! He needed to come up with a way to convince the
Flamewing God to eat the verdant azuresoul. He would never be able to
forgive himself if he didn’t at least try to tame the Chaos
Primordial trapped before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
already have food.” The Flamewing God sat back down, then waved a
paw. This paw had a bracelet around it, and the bracelet suddenly lit
up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Basins of delicacies began to fly out, including both
meats as well as spirit-fruits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God gave Ning and Azurefiend a smug glance, then began to
chomp down on its own food.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_029__Flam"></A>
Chapter 29: You Are The Best</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the stories say that Chaos Primordials wander through the cosmos by
themselves. They are fairly dumb and are easily angered… and the
only thing they like to do is eat!” Azurefiend sipped his wine,
glancing sideways at the distant Flamewing God as he spoke mentally
to Ji Ning. “These things supposedly will eat almost anything. When
they run into a realmverse, they’ll go so far as to slowly work its
way through and devour the entire realmverse and everything within
it. While they wander the Chaosverse by themselves, they’ll
generally create their own estate-treasures and put living creatures
inside, having those creatures provide food and wine for them to eat
and drink whenever they so desire.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning nodded. He knew all this, of course. Ever since he had acquired
the verdant azuresoul, he had immediately searched for every scrap of
information regarding Chaos Primordials that he could find. How could
he possibly not know that Chaos Primordials loved to eat? This was
the reason why Autarch Bolin had modified that verdant azuresoul with
the goal of using it to control a Chaos Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Azurefiend, I acquired many different types of spirit-fruit and rare
delicacies from the Hegemons and Emperors who came to the Jadefire
Realm last time. Want to try some?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’d
be willing to share?” Azurefiend’s eyes lit up. Rare
spirit-fruits and delicacies were of tremendous interest to major
powers, but many were so rare that major powers would only eat them
sparingly. They would generally unwilling to eat them casually and in
large amounts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course! Come, sample some of this wine. This came from Hegemon
Blackwood,” Ning said as he picked up a large gourd and unstoppered
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
An aroma of fragrant wine immediately spread out to fill the entire
hidden region. Hegemon Azurefiend’s eyes gleamed with a greedy
light as he stared at the gourd. “Haha, it seems that looting from
Hegemons and Emperors really is the fastest way to acquire treasures.
I’ve only tasted this ‘Six Bandit Caves’ spirit-wine a single
time in the past. Hegemon Blackwood truly is impressive in the Dao of
Numerancy; someone must have asked him for help and used this wine in
trade. Quick, let me taste some of it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t have much of this wine. You have to drink it slowly! Once we
finish this gourd, we won’t have any more left,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh, I’ll definitely savor it.” Hegemon Azurefiend was truly
excited. He really was a glutton.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Flamewing God sniffed the air, then lifted its head and
turned to stare in their direction. A chunk of meat fell out of its
open mouth and onto the ground, but it didn’t even notice. It
stared intently at the gourd of wine on Ning’s desk, the smell of
the wine driving it crazy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
its estate-treasure held many living creatures inside who were
devoted to providing it food and drink, only ordinary types of
sustenance could be provided. Truly rare spirit-fruits and delicacies
could only be harvested from extremely unique environments, as they
were formed based on drawing upon various unique types of energy from
the Chaosverse. How could an estate-treasure possibly create good
food?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
each drink one glass at a time. Take it slow and don’t even think
about trying to hog it for yourself,” Ning said in a stingy manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine,
fine!” Hegemon Azurefiend was feeling quite impatient. Ning nodded,
pouring them each a glass. Whoosh. A deep red liquid that was almost
ruby-colored came dribbling out of the gourd and into the two wine
glasses. It looked absolutely mouth-watering.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly seemed to sense something, and he turned to stare off
in the distance. The Flamewing God’s mouth was open, and it was
literally drooling onto the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“T-this
wine…” The Flamewing God swallowed, then immediately said: “Can
I have some of it?” It was born with a love of food and wine, but
it had been ages since it had enjoyed such fine wine. It was
completely unable to resist the urge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
way! We only have just one gourd. There’s not even enough for the
two of us,” Hegemon Azurefiend said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t going to share?” The Flamewing God was growing rather
angry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
trying to scare me. You are bound inside that cage, and your flames
can’t harm us at all.” Hegemon Azurefiend was a glutton as well.
There was no way he was going to share the little wine they had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…!”
The Flamewing God’s eyes turned round with indignation. It wasn’t
very intelligent, and it usually just took whatever it wanted! Now
that it was trapped, however, taking by force was no longer an
option… but it really did want to drink some of that fine wine!!!
When it smelled that wine, it no longer had any appetite for the
basins of food that lay in front of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
this is our first time seeing a Chaos Primordial. To be able to eat
and drink with one of them is a lucky event. Let’s not be stingy,”
Ning said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
right!” The Flamewing God instantly grew excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
the point of feeding it? It’s pointless! Better to feed me
instead,” Azurefiend argued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“YOU…!”
The Flamewing God glared furiously at Azurefiend, feeling an
increasing level of distaste towards that skinny old man. It said
furiously, “I’ll EAT you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
and try,” Azurefiend snickered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough,
enough. Let’s not fight. Flamewing was captured by the Sithe, while
we cultivators fought a bloody war against them. If you view it from
that perspective, we’re actually all on the same side,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
right! Your name is Darknorth, right? I agree with what you say, one
hundred percent. You are spot on! The two of us are on the same
side,” the Flamewing God said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
his heart, Ning felt rather ashamed. He was swindling something with
the intelligence of a child! Still, he would eventually be saving the
creature by releasing it from its prison. It could be said that he
was helping it out as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
very happy to be able to feast alongside a Chaos Primordial. Here,
have another gourd.” Ning tossed out a gourd towards the Flamewing
God’s direction, causing it to fly straight towards the creature.
The Flamewing God was instantly excited upon seeing it, and it sent
out an invisible hand of energy which caught the gourd, pulled out
the stopper, and then poured out the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God opened its mouth wide and immediately began to guzzle
the wine down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are seriously…” Hegemon Azurefiend felt rather speechless about
all of this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
it’s fine. I have plenty of things to eat and drink. Those Hegemons
brought me quite a bit of spirit-fruit and other treasures.” Ning
waved his hand, causing a large amount of spirit-fruit and other
special foodstuffs to appear on the tables. Spirit-fruits were unique
fruits which by some mechanism were able to take in some of the
essences of the Chaosverse. Some were even used in alchemy to refine
pills. Others were used to make wine, while still others could be
eaten raw!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
ones Ning had just brought out were all delicious when eaten. They
were unfathomably more delicious than the legendary ‘Peaches of
Immortality’ of the Three Realms had been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Azurefiend began to laugh loudly when he saw this. He immediately
reached out with his large but scrawny hand to grab some fruit, then
began to munch down on it. Juice from the fruit splattered across his
mouth, and a look of contentment was in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
I have some of the fruit as well?” The distant Flamewing God looked
at Ning in a pitiable manner. It had already finished the wine; Ning
had only given it a single gourd, after all. Azurefiend had only
taken tiny sips of the wine, while the Flamewing God had guzzled it
down like water. Yes, the feeling had been great, but it was over in
the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God felt as though every single one of the fruits on the
table was absolutely eniticing to it, and the fragrance was driving
it mad. Normally, it would’ve seized all the fruit for itself, but
it currently was only able to beg for alms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I have plenty of fruit as well.” Ning waved his hand, causing a
large basin of fruits to fly over. This basin had a hundred different
types of fruit within it, and they all emanated different yet
charming auras. One of them was a large egg-shaped item… the
‘verdant azuresoul’ which Ning had acquired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
large basin of fruit flew over towards the Flamewing God. Ning
laughed: “You have to eat a bit more slowly this time. If you
swallow it all in one gulp, I’m not going to be able to afford
giving you much more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God drooled as it stared at the basin of fruit in front of
it. It wanted to eat all of it, with the verdant azuresoul being of
especial interest. Its eyes reddened with excitement and gratitude as
it turned to look at Ning. It felt as though this cultivator was the
best person in the entire Chaosverse, and it immediately said: “You
are absolutely the best! If I can escape this place, I’ll
definitely help you out.” After speaking, it lowered its head and
began to eat the fruit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
seemed quite relaxed, but in truth he was watching intently. It has
to eat it. It has to eat the verdant azuresoul!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wow,
this is delicious! Its been a long, long time since I’ve had so
much good food.” The Flamewing God was incomparably excited. Even
before the Sithe had captured it, it would only very rarely have a
chance to encounter such delicious food. After being captured, its
life became even duller; the Sithe hadn’t given it anything to eat
at all. It could only rely on its own food and drink the ordinary
wine which the living beings in its estate-world created for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to eat this one first. It smells so good!” The Flamewing God
opened its mouth and chomped down at the verdant azuresoul, which was
the most alluring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crunch!
Crunch! The Flamewing God devoured the verdant soul at one go, its
mouth filled with absolute bliss as it slowly chewed away at the
fruit before finally swallowing it down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
seated off in the distance, quickly sensed a ripple emanate from the
beast. The invisible ripple had completely merged into the Flamewing
God’s body and permeated through its soul and truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Success.”
Ning let out a sigh of relief. It had all seemed so very simple, but
he had been more nervous than during any battle in recent memory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God lowered its head to eat some more fruit, but it
couldn’t help but look up towards Ning every so often. It felt
increasingly well-disposed towards Ning; the man was simply too good
to it. It suddenly felt a strong sense of attachment towards Ning, as
though Ning was the person it trusted and liked the most in all the
Chaosverse. It didn’t even realize that its truesoul had been
dominated; all it knew was that it felt a sense of bone-deep love and
veneration towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he picked up a glass of wine and began to walk straight
towards the Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!”
Whitethaw was shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
move too close to it.” Azurefiend was shocked as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. It’ll be fine,” Ning said. He moved towards the six chains
and began to inspect them. He had to come up with a way to break the
formations securing these chains. Only then would he be able to
rescue the Flamewing God. If he wasn’t able to do that, then taming
it would’ve been a pointless act.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_030__Flam"></A>
Chapter 30: Friends For Life</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Azurefiend had been seated in the lotus position, but he hurriedly
jumped to his feet to pull Ji Ning back. The Flamewing God was
capable of killing even Hegemons with ease; a puny Daolord would be
nothing to it. How could Azurefiend not be worried?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unfortunately,
Ning moved far too fast. With a single step, he appeared right next
to the Flamewing God, who turned to look at the tiny little speck
that had just appeared next to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful!” Azurefiend and Whitethaw both held their breaths. Ning
was now so close that they wouldn’t be able to intervene in time!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want some too?” The Flamewing God looked at the tiny human before
it, a happy look in its eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
this day forth, why don’t you stick by my side?” Ning raised his
head to stare at the titanic beast before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.
Alright. But you have to give me food,” the Flamewing God said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
one would be able to give you this much spirit-fruit every day.
However, I promise that you’ll have much more and much better food
than you have in your estate-treasure,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God felt delighted for a moment, but it then turned to look
helplessly at the black chains behind it. “But I’m trapped here.
I want to leave with you, but I’m unable to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me take a close look.” Ning flew over as he spoke, landing on the
Flamewing God’s giant body and moving towards one of the black
chains attached to its wings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
and Whitethaw both stared blankly at this sight. “B-but…”
Azurefiend was dazed. “Flamewing is a Chaos Primordial. Why is it
being so obedient? Aren’t Chaos Primordials supposed to be easily
angered and moved to eat anything that approaches them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Taming
a Chaos Primordial was an incredibly difficult task. It had a child’s
intelligence and a child’s temper. It was entirely possible that it
would be happily jesting with a cultivator one moment, then devour
that cultivator in the next. Not even the Sithe were able to tame it;
the only thing they could do was send three Exalts to capture it with
overwhelming power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t know. All I know is that it seems to be very obedient towards
my master.” Whitethaw felt puzzled as well. He transformed into a
streak of light, wishing to move closer to Ning and protect him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Flamewing had been squatting there while eating fruit, but now he
raised his head to glare at the approaching Whitethaw in a baleful
manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
good, Flamewing. He’s my Protector while the other guy is my
retainer. Don’t hurt them,” Ning said from his position atop
Flamewing’s back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh,
alright.” Flamewing immediately calmed down and ignored Whitethaw.
The terrified Whitethaw finally landed on Flamewing’s back as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you have to be careful. This Flamewing God might be playing nice now,
but it might very well turn on you in the next moment,” Whitethaw
said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
won’t happen.” Ning was very calm, and his gaze continued to be
focused on the black chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
this is a Chaos Primordial!” Whitethaw still didn’t feel safe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. He turned to sweep Whitethaw and the distant
Azurefiend with his gaze, then said: “Starting today, Flamewing
shall be one of my followers as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you…?” Whitethaw instantly understood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
are you saying that the Flamewing God has already submitted…” the
distant Azurefiend sent a stunned mental message to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. No longer paying any further attention to their astonishment,
he focused completely on analyzing the black chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Protector
Whitethaw and Hegemon Azurefiend truly were stunned by this. Ning had
tamed a Chaos Primordial? This was absolutely inconceivable. Chaos
Primordials were incredibly rare, and not even Hegemons knew how to
tame them. The Sithe weren’t capable of it either. Most likely,
only the supremely exalted Autarchs were capable of such a thing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
tame a Chaos Primordial, one had to both be lucky enough to encounter
one while also having a method of taming it. Clearly, their master
‘Ji Ning’ had one such method which had allowed him to tame it
without anyone being the wiser.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
tamed the Flamewing God… absolutely incredible. Simply incredible!
A pity that the Flamewing God is trapped here. If he could come up
with a way to release it… haha, the Flamewing God would ensure that
Darknorth’s reputation would skyrocket to incredible heights. Who
would dare cause trouble for him? He could simply order Flamewing to
attack and wipe that person out.” Hegemon Azurefiend sighed in awe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
even Realmslord Windgrace would be able to withstand Flamewing’s
retribution. No one would ever dare to antagonize a major power who
commanded a Chaos Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Azurefiend flew over as well. Now that he knew that Flamewing had
been tamed, he no longer felt as worried as he had previously. “How
does it look, Darknorth? Are you able to break these chains?”
Azurefiend asked. If Ning was unable to breach the chains, then this
would all be for naught, and the tamed Chaos Primordial would not be
able to overawe the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned as he stared intently at the black chains. The chains were
actually formed from countless black threads that were woven
together, each of which was covered with countless tiny formations.
The formations weren’t that complicated; given Ning’s current
level of mastery in the Dao of Formations, he would be able to
resolve them with ease. The problem was that the seeming-ordinary
formations engraved upon the chains were all wrapped together and
merged into a larger and even more complicated formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single chain had a suppressive effect as well as an energy absorption
effect. The suppressive effect caused the Flamewing God to be
completely tied down, preventing it from even changing in size.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
marvelous formations.” Ning suddenly moved. Swish! Swish! Swish! He
flew to one black chain after another, this time moving quite quickly
as he carried out his inspections.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mmm.
As I thought, all six of the black chains are virtually identical,
and they also work together.” Countless thoughts flitted through
Ning’s mind as he sought to come up with a way to resolve this
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, he already had certain ideas when he saw the chains from afar.
Now that he was able to inspect them closely, he completely
understood how all of the formations operated. However, understanding
was one thing; resolving the formations was another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
does it look?” Azurefiend asked again. “Can you solve it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
you are even more impatient than I am,” Ning teased with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can I not be? That’s a Chaos Primordial! If you came bring this
Chaos Primordial into the outside world, you can literally do
whatever you want.” Azurefiend was quite excited. “It’ll belong
to you, but as your retainer… ahaha! Hurry up and tell me if you
can solve it or not!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “I can!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was delighted. “Incredible! Impressive indeed. My head hurts just
looking at those black chains and their formations… but you think
you can solve them? There probably are very few Hegemons who are a
match for you in the Dao of Formations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. Of course! His mastery of the Dao of Formations had already
reached the Archon level. Only someone who had relied on the Dao of
Formations to complete the Daomerge and become a Hegemon would be
able to surpass him in this regard! But to do that was no easy task.
No one in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance had ever been able to do
such a thing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
long would it take, approximately?” Azurefiend asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hard
to say. A few chaos cycles, probably,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fast! You can complete it in just a few chaos cycles?” Azurefiend
praised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
secretly muttered to himself. It might be just a ‘few’ chaos
cycles, but that was because his Primaltwin was under the affects of
accelerated time. It would be equivalent to a few hundred
‘accelerated’ chaos cycles!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
chains and their formations were extremely complex. The only reason
why he stood a chance at breaking them was because he had access to
many other similar Sithe formations and a very high level of insight
into the art of formations, as well as the assistance of the
Autarch’s stone dais. Despite that, it would still take him a few
hundred chaos cycles!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
Ning didn’t really mind. By now, he was finding it extremely
difficult to make any breakthroughs in his Omega Sword Dao. The only
step waiting for him was the Daomerge! Thus, his goal right now was
to focus more on other Daos, including formations, water, fire, time,
space, etc. The more insight he gained into these Daos, the more
assistance they would be to him in the Daomerge. All Daos shared
certain commonalities, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,
I’m going to leave for a short while. I’ll be back soon,” Ning
said as he flew off its body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
The Flamewing God suddenly raised its head to stare at Ning’s
departing figure. “You aren’t going to abandon me, are you?”
For some strange reason, it truly wanted to stay by Ning’s side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, I’ll be back soon,” Ning said. In his heart, he couldn’t
help but sigh. Flamewing was a Chaos Primordial, born with incredible
strength but no true understanding of how to use it. It had never
‘trained’ before, and it didn’t even notice that Autarch Bolin
had used a technique to invisibly infiltrate its soul and truesoul.
Still… to live a life of ignorant bliss was a form of joy as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The giant red copper gate appeared once more, with Ning, Whitethaw,
and Azurefiend both flying through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
are we leaving?” Azurefiend asked while flying out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’ll
take quite some time for me to breach those chains. Before beginning,
I need to go release Ninedust,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust?
Oh, that friend who you risked your life for in jumping into the
Jadefire Realm?” Azurefiend laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
We’re friends for life.” Ning nodded.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_37_Chapter_031__Flam"></A>
Chapter 31: Soon</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning sent the realmship flying towards Ninedust’s location at high
speeds. The silver-robed Ninedust was seated in the lotus position,
surrounded by those whirling flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ninedust noticed a streak of light moving towards him from afar. It
quickly flew near him, resolving itself into the form of a rather
tattered-looking realmship. Three figures emerged from the realmship,
with the leader being a white-robed youth who bore a black sheath on
his back. It was his good friend, Daolord Darknorth – Ji Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Ninedust was happy to see him, but felt mixed emotions as well. As
the original instigator of all the events which had occurred in the
Jadefire Realm, the Ancient cultivators had kept him up to date on
everything which had happened since. Ji Ning had successfully slain
Archon Silksnow in order to rescue him! Alas, he had fallen for
Archon Silksnow’s last act of revenge. Hegemons and Emperors from
many other realmverses had come here, seeking to take his realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thankfully,
the results weren’t so bad; Ning had managed to take on Hegemon
Azurefiend as his retainer and force everyone to retreat! In his
heart, Ninedust felt tremendous gratitude towards Ning. He knew how
much risk Ning had undertaken on his behalf. A single misplaced step
would’ve resulted in Ning’s death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust.”
Ning smiled as he walked over towards the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
have you suddenly come to see me? Have you gotten bored working away
on that formation?” Ninedust laughed. Ning had told him many years
ago that he would have to first completely disrupt the
formation-diagram in order to take control over the prisons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
here out of success, not boredom,” Ning said. “You can come out
now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
out?” Ninedust was stunned. Was he really going to be able to
escape this nightmarish prison cell?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gently waved a finger. Whoosh! The flames around the flaming cage
instantly parted, revealing an exit. “Hurry up and come out… or
are you planning to complete your Daomerge inside?” Ning smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
stunned Ninedust immediately transformed into a streak of light and
scurried out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
actually out.” Ninedust stood within the empty space outside the
cage. He stared at himself, then at the flaming cage by his side in
disbelief. “It was actually as simple as that. I came out with no
fuss at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yeah,
it was simple for YOU. Breaking the formation wasn’t simple at all
for me,” Ning immediately said. He had needed both the Autarch’s
stone dais as well as the many records regarding Sithe formation
techniques. Both were absolutely critical to his success!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know you worked hard. Hey, your realmship is still missing some
parts, right? Take it! Consider it your wages for the past few years.
Don’t even think about asking me for more.” As he spoke, he
tossed a realmship part over to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seeing
this, Ning didn’t move to decline. They were good friends; he
naturally understood how Ninedust felt right now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack
clack clack! The realmship immediately swallowed the entire part, and
some of the superficial damage began to be repaired once more. Soon,
the realmship was in a state where only a few small parts of it
remained damaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I’m almost completely repaired now. My internals are in good shape,
with just a few missing parts preventing me from fully repairing my
exterior,” the realmship-spirit sent mentally. “However, I should
be able to teleport and blink just as effectively as if I was in 100%
shape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. He was planning to give the realmship to the Autarch. Ning
had been worried that the Autarch would be unhappy if the damage to
the realmship was too great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
gentleman here must be Hegemon Azurefiend.” Ninedust turned to look
at the skinny old man standing next to Ning. Not daring to be
disrespectful, he said with a touch of respect, “Ninedust greets
you, Hegemon Azurefiend.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
It seems Darknorth and you truly are very good friends. To be able to
find a few true lifelong friends on the path of cultivation is worth
any price.” Hegemon Azurefiend had a rather complicated look on his
face, but when he realized it he hurriedly smiled: “Darknorth
kicked up quite a storm when he came here to rescue you. Quite a few
Hegemons and Emperors came.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
felt rather moved by all this. He truly had been the cause of this
great affair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
now that I’m out, shall we leave the Jadefire Realm?” Ninedust
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
still have some business here in the Jadefire Realm. I can’t leave
just yet,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
then I’ll leave on my own.” Ninedust laughed. “My greatest goal
right now is to complete my Daomerge. I need to go out and experience
more things. If I stay here with you in the Jadefire Realm, it’ll
be detrimental to me with regards to the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Alright. Be careful out there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, I won’t be so unlucky as to need rescuing again.” Ninedust
suddenly walked forward and gave Ning a tight hug, then turend and
left. “Train hard. I’m planning to start my Daomerge soon. We
brothers must both succeed in our Daomerges!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust’s
voice still echoed in the air, but he himself had already vanished.
Ning could sense the determination in Ninedust’s voice when the
latter spoke of the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Succeed
in the Daomerge together, eh?” Ning turned and went back the way he
came. Friends for life didn’t need to actually be together for
their entire lives; it was enough for them to keep each other in
their hearts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on like water. Ninedust continued his adventures through the
outside world, encountering quite a few strokes of karmic fortune. As
for Ning, he remained within the Jadefire Realm and focused on
analyzing those black chains and their formations. But of course, he
had also swept the prison regions clean of all the treasures it held…
and this time, he truly made a killing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he had acquired a few treasures from threatening the Hegemons and
Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, the combined value of
those treasures was perhaps at best comparable to a single Hegemon’s
networth. The treasures within the prison regions, however, were far
more numerous… and Ning had swept through all of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, another five chaos cycles went past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a dark region in the Great Dark which was incomparably distant from
the Flamedragon Realmverse. This was a dark void which held an
enormous triangular region within it that was filled with dazzlingly
beautiful palaces, each of which emanated blinding golden light. This
was the residence of one of the truly supreme leaders of the
cultivator civilizations… the home of Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
were extremely difficult to track down. Autarch Titanos was one of
the easier ones to find, because he almost always resided within his
estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. A howling sound could be heard coming from within a
private room inside the largest, most towering palace in the region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
skull-sized gray globe which was covered with countless runes was
levitating up and down in the air, emitting a strange whooshing sound
as its internals continuously changed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
beautiful. How lovely.” The bald, black-robed old man next to the
globe was staring at it greedily, his golden eyes filled with joy and
the two fleshy antennae on his head quivering in excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
truly is perfect. Just a small amount of power is needed. Once the
insides of the globe continuously guide the power and transform it,
its able to unleash absolutely terrifying levels of destructive
power. Sithe frabrication techniques were simply incredible. Although
we had an overwhelming advantage in individual power during the Dawn
War, we still nearly ended up being defeated by the Sithe. The Sithe
truly were and are incredible. To this very day, I still don’t
fully understand their technologies.” The bald old man stared
greedily at the orb, as though he was staring at the person he loved
the most.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh… last time, I wasn’t careful and put in too much power,
wrecking this treasure. Thank goodness that I, Titanos, am awesome.
Although I still don’t fully understand this thing, I was still
able to repair it! Ahahaha…” The bald old man stared at the
continuously changing runes on the surface of the globe, feeling
increasingly delighted as he did so. His gaze was able to see through
everything, allowing him to observe the intricate transformations
occurring within the gray globe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
transformations were absolutely beautiful to him. Suddenly, the gray
globe lifted up into the air and floated in front of him. The fleshy
antennae on top of the bald old man’s head reached out to gently
stroke the globe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
I managed to successfully repair one, I’m still not able to create
them from scratch.” The bald old man shook his head. “The Sithe’s
underlying foundation of knowledge remains far superior to that of
our cultivator civilizations. I can’t even imagine how long it
would take for us to fully repair all of their shattered treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man waved his hand, causing the gray orb to vanish into thin
air. Whoosh. He pushed open the door to the private room, then
strolled out with his long black robes dragging behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
When he reached the palace gates, an azure-robed youth immediately
came to greet him. The youth said joyfully, “Master, you repaired
it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course! When have I ever failed? Don’t you know who I am? I’m an
Autarch!” the bald old man said smugly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
right,” the azure-robed youth said hastily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Xian,
my boy… that Daolord Darknorth from the Flamedragon Realmverse
asked me to help out just a few dozen chaos cycles ago, yes? I told
you I’d be done soon!” the bald old man said smugly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was pretty quick, this time.” The azure-robed youth nodded. This
was one of the faster response times for Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well,
I’m off to the Flamedragon Realmverse,” the bald old man said,
then waved his sleeves. Whoosh. Space rippled before him like water.
The bald old man stepped into the rippling space, then disappeared
without a trace.</P>
