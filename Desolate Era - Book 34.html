Chapter 1 - Reviving Yu Wei
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Winesage, and
Ninedust were all rather dazed as they watched the three Hegemons and
numerous supreme Eternal Emperors fly towards them. Ning immediately
recognized the white-bearded old man with six curved horns on his
head as Hegemon Brightshore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other two
Hegemons, one was a dazzlingly beautiful scepter-bearing woman; when
Ning saw her, he felt as though he had seen the most beautiful
creature in all of existence and felt the uncontrollable desire to
venerate her. It was impossible for anyone to feel any untoward
thoughts regarding her at all! The second Hegemon was a man with long
green hair and a big green beard. His hair, his eyebrows, and his
beard were all extremely long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Brightshore Hegemon smiled. “Let me make the introductions. This
gentleman here is Hegemon Windrain of the Aberrants.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
green-haired, green-bearded man. Hegemon Windrain had a very unusual
aura. When Ning looked at him, he felt as though he was staring at a
vast forest of trees. “Greetings, Hegemon Windrain,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This person stood at
the very apex of power within the Endless Territories. How could Ning
dare to be disrespectful in the slightest?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend, you really are quite impressive. There are only nine command
talismans in there, but you acquired eight of them. Impressive,
impressive!” Hegemon Windrain praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning,
Ninedust, and Winesage were all stunned. They looked at each other.
None of them had publicized the fact that Ninedust had given Ning
three talismans while Winesage had given Ning two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t feel so
surprised,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “Realmsoul Polo informed
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Now Ning and
the others understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me continue with
the introductions.” Hegemon Brightshore’s voice turned a bit cool
as he glanced at the woman: “This is Hegemon Netherlily of the
Ancient cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend
Darknorth.” Hegemon Netherlily was surpassingly beautiful and her
voice was extremely soft; one couldn’t help but feel friendly
towards her. She smiled as she looked at Ning. “You are such an
impressive talent, but you ended up joining the Brightshore Kingdom.
What a pity! It’s all because this old fellow Brightshore is so
completely shameless as to randomly abduct cultivators throughout the
Endless Territories and bring them to the Brightshore Kingdom. If it
wasn’t for that, given the relationship between you and Ninedust, I
feel confident that you might choose to end up joining us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancient
cultivators, much like the Brightshore Kingdom, did allow certain
cultivators to join them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jealousy. That’s
just jealousy talking,” Hegemon Brightshore said coolly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had been
abducted by the Brightshore Kingdom, he didn’t feel any resentment
towards Hegemon Brightshore. If it hadn’t been for the guidance
provided by the Brightshore Kingdom, the many sword-arts he had given
access to within the Sword Palace, and the chance to visit the
Genesis Lands of the alternate universe he visited, he might not have
been able to develop his Omega Sword Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This gentleman right
here is Emperor Goldisle of the Dao Alliance.” Hegemon Brightshore
was slightly nervous, as the Dao Alliance would definitely be his
greatest competitor in bidding for the fruits which Ning had
acquired. “Emperor Goldisle is one of the two leaders of the Dao
Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth and I have
met.” The gold-furred alien smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. And this
gentleman is Emperor Islehide of the Aeonians.” Hegemon Brightshore
didn’t want to give Emperor Goldisle the chance to chat too much
with Ning, and so he immediately began to introduce the others.
Emperor Islehide was a peerlessly handsome man who was even more
attractive than Hegemon Netherlily was beautiful. He had long red
hair and dim red eyes that were filled with a strange charisma.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Emperor Islehide smiled slightly as he glanced at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
replied, “Emperor Islehide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last one is
Emperor Severfive of the Dark Kingdom.” Hegemon Brightshore glanced
sideways at the rather bizarre-looking alien elder, whose long blue
hair flowed up from his head like a pair of wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth.”
Emperor Severfive looked at Ning with a very sincere and modest gaze.
Those who actually interacted with the Emperors of the Dark Kingdom
all knew that the Dark Kingdom was actually quite low-key and modest.
They were outsiders and foreigners who were despised and ostracized
by the native organizations of the Endless Territories and thus
couldn’t afford to be too brash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The people I’ve
just introduced you to are more than capable of representing the six
organizations in the Endless Territories,” Hegemon Brightshore
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the six,
there were also a number of retainers and servants present. For
example, Hegemon Brightshore had a single-horned youth who had a very
ordinary aura standing by his side, while Emperor Islehide of the
Aeonians had an ordinary looking white-robed woman standing next to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come over here,
Winesage,” Emperor Severfive instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.” Winesage
obediently walked over to Emperor Severfive’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redwater.” Hegemon
Netherlily looked at Ninedust, who immediately and obediently flew
over to her side as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the supreme
leaders of the six greatest powers in the Endless Territories, Ning
couldn’t help but feel a sense of pressure… but he also felt
excitement! These were the people who might have the answers as to
how he could revive his wife. Even if they couldn’t do it, they
would definitely know much more about it than he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, we need
some of the coldflame cauldron fruits,” Emperor Severfive of the
Dark Kingdom said hurriedly. “Just tell me what you need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be so
hasty.” Emperor Goldisle of the Dao Alliance said calmly, “Why
don’t we let Darknorth list what he needs first. The side which can
assist him the most shall be the side Darknorth chooses.” The Dao
Alliance was able to speak so confidently due to their great wealth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Hegemon
Brightshore nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let our young
friend Darknorth tell us what he needs,” Hegemon Netherlily agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend?”
Hegemon Windrain looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Hegemons were
the strongest experts in the Endless Territories and had been alive
for extremely long periods of time. As a result, they were also quite
wealthy, which was why they dared to compete against the Dao Alliance
in this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors…” Ning
said respectfully, “There is indeed something I would like to
request.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Emperor
Goldisle said confidently. The three Hegemons as well as Emperor
Severfive and Emperor Islehide all looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once had a beloved
Dao-companion,” Ning said slowly. “Long ago, she perished. The
main reason why I’ve trained so hard is primarily because I wish to
bring her back to life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Winesage and
Ninedust heard this, they stared at Ning in shock. Revive a
Dao-companion? None of them had ever imagined that Ning held a secret
like this in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Revive?” Hegemon
Windrain’s green brows furrowed in a frown. “I imagine her soul
and truesoul were shattered?” If her truesoul was still around,
reviving her would be extremely easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of the
Hegemons exchanged glances, as did the three Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll ask the
questions,” Hegemon Netherlily said. The others all nodded towards
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, when your
Dao-companion died, had she reached the World level of power?”
Hegemon Netherlily’s gaze was very gentle, as was her voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She had not.” Ning
immediately explained, “She was merely a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Netherlily
nodded slightly. “Mm. Fairly weak. There’s still a chance at
reviving her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was wildly
overjoyed upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My next question is,
where did she die?” Hegemon Netherlily asked, “Did she die in an
everworld? A chaosworld? In the emptiness of space? Or in an
alternate universe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She died in my
homeland, in a chaosworld,” Ning explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In a chaosworld?”
Hegemon Netherlily frowned. “That makes things difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Difficult?” Ning’s
heart clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reviving those who
died in everworlds is the simplest; any Hegemon is capable of doing
this,” Hegemon Netherlily explained. “Reviving those who died in
alternate universes, also known as otherverses, is a bit more
difficult. Reviving those who died in chaosworlds or in the emptiness
of space is the most difficult of all. Although she was merely a
Celestial Immortal, this still isn’t something the likes of us are
capable of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
nearby Hegemon Brightshore explained, “Everworlds contain the rules
and laws established by the Eternal Emperors who created them. You
can view them as basic, rudimentary versions of the prime essences.
For example, if the founding Emperor established a law that ‘the
skies are dark’, the skies in that everworld shall forever be dark.
If he says that ‘flying is impossible’, then no one will be able
to fly in that everworld. The only way to get around this is through
possessing so much brute force that one can resist the binding
effects of those laws.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everworlds have
elementary prime essences within them, and those who die in an
everworld shall return to those everworld prime essences. If you wish
to twist spacetime and revive a Celestial Immortal, you would only
need to resist the backlash from the everworld. Everworld’s are
fairly weak; most Hegemons are capable of doing such a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Otherverses are
generally the same size as a realmverse. You’ve visited one of them
in the past,” Hegemon Brightshore explained. “I think you
understand that these otherverses have their own prime essences, and
their prime essences are far more perfect than the ones within the
everworlds!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various
otherverses all have their own prime essences. If a cultivator dies
in one of those otherverses, his or her truesoul shall return to the
prime essences of that otherverse. If you wish to revive someone, you
must be able to endure the backlash generated by that entire
alternate universe,” Hegemon Brightshore explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for chaosworlds
or the void of space? They don’t have any prime essences they
belong to, and so whenever a truesoul in a chaosworld is
extinguished, its energy shall revert back to the Chaosverse itself.
If you wish to revive such a person, you’ll need to be able to
endure the backlash generated by the entire Chaosverse! This is a
terrifying concept,” Hegemon Brightshore explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reviving someone in an
everworld was easy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reviving someone in an
otherverse was hard?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reviving someone from
the Chaosverse was nearly impossible?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face grew
uglier and uglier as he absorbed this information. “What exactly is
a ‘realmverse’? And what is the ‘Chaosverse’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He remembered that the
Starflow race which lived in the Terror Starsea had once lived in a
place named the Peacock Lotus Realmverse. A grand war had destroyed
that realmverse, resulting in the Starflow race fleeing and moving to
the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our home, the
Endless Territories, is a realmverse,” Hegemon Brightshore
explained. “Its true name is the Flamedragon Realmverse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the
Chaosverse, it is the source of all things and is truly infinite
beyond measure…” Hegemon Brightshore explained, “It is like a
vast, endless sea. Realmverses are like small reefs within that vast
sea! Otherverses are another type of reef, a fairly special type. All
reefs are located extremely far from each other, and so the Great
Dark is the vast emptiness between reefs. All realmverses are very,
very far away from each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea? Reefs? Ning
was rather dazed by all this. The alternate universes and the
‘Endless Territories’ were nothing more than ‘reefs’, while
the Chaosverse was an ocean?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then who is strong
enough to resist the backlash from the Chaosverse and revive my
Dao-companion?” Ning grew increasingly anxious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Dao-companion
was only a Celestial Immortal. Although reviving her will be
difficult, at least there is hope,” Hegemon Netherlily said.
</P>

Chapter 2 - Autarch
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hope?” Ji Ning’s
eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Netherlily,
Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Emperor Severfive, Emperor
Goldisle, and Emperor Islehide all secretly shook their heads.
Hegemon Netherlily continued, “There is no way for an Eternal
Emperor to resist the backlash from the Chaosverse. Only those
legendary figures who are even more powerful than Eternal Emperors
can accomplish it… only they can reverse spacetime and revive your
Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even more powerful
than Eternal Emperors?” Ning was stunned, as were Ninedust and
Winesage. There was a level of power beyond that of the Eternal
Emperors?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Chaosverse is
vast and without end, filled with realmverses and otherverses.”
Hegemon Netherlily’s voice was soft and drifting. “The most
powerful figures who stand at the apex of each realmverse or
otherverse are almost always the Hegemons! However… the vast
Chaosverse has figures of even greater power. We respectfully address
them as ‘Autarch’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarch?” Ning
immediately engraved this title into his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore
nodded, a look of eagerness in his eyes. “Yes. Autarchs! Everworlds
are created by Eternal Emperors… and otherverses are created by
Autarchs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They created the
otherverses?” Ning was stunned. He had been to one of those
alternate universes before. It had contained a complete set of prime
essences, such as the Dao of the Sword and many other Daos. All of
those things could be sensed! How could such a universe have been
artificially created?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs are the
true and absolute rulers of the Chaosverse who stand above all other
living beings,” Hegemon Netherlily said. “We Eternal Emperors
have developed our own eternal Daos… but that isn’t the true apex
of cultivation. Only by making repeated breakthroughs and raising
your Dao to a level where it can become one of the prime essences of
the universe can a cultivator be capable of creating an otherverse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs are
incredibly rare. I’ve never met any of them in my entire life.”
Hegemon Brightshore shook his head, while the other two Hegemons
revealed looks of envy and admiration. They hadn’t met any Autarchs
either; they had only heard of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Sithe
launched that war, it encompassed a great many places. The main
reason why we cultivators were able to gain victory over them was
because we had our Autarchs,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “Although
the Sithe were extremely strong and incredibly advanced in many
areas, the Autarchs led us to completely wipe the Sithe out in the
end. If it wasn’t for the Autarchs, we probably would’ve been
annihilated or enslaved long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust, and
Winesage were all speechless. Autarchs? So the highest level of
cultivation in the Chaosverse was the Autarch level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are capable of
reversing spacetime and roam through the Chaosverse with ease! They
are even capable of creating those alternate universes…” Hegemon
Brightshore continued, “If an Autarch was willing to spend the
time, he would be able to destroy even the likes of the Yin-Yang
Samsara Wheels that threaten and will eventually annihilate our
Flamedragon Realmverse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs are capable
of destroying the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels?” The nearby Winesage
couldn’t help but ask, “Then why don’t we invite them to help
out? Are they really going to just watch as such a vast realmverse is
annihilated?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are mistaken,”
Hegemon Windrain replied. “Autarchs view things through a
completely different lens than the rest of us. An Autarch once said
that all things and all creatures in the universe must follow the
natural cycle of life and death. The Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels were
born from the primordial chaos for the express purpose of wiping out
the Flamedragon Realmverse. In other words, it is part of the laws
and functioning of the Chaosverse. If they were forcibly destroy the
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, they would suffer a backlash from the
Chaosverse itself, and an incredibly strong one at that. The Autarchs
are not willing to do such a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs have truly
transcended beyond all things. They are absolutely invincible, and
neither spacetime nor karma nor anything else have any impact on them
at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To them, the birth
and destruction of entire realmverses is nothing more than the
blooming and withering of a flower. I have never even seen an Autarch
in my entire life.” Hegemon Windrain looked at Ning. “Darknorth,
my young friend… only an Autarch is capable of rescuing your
Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart sank. He
had to ask an Autarch to intervene? The three Hegemons had been
around for countless years, but none of them had even seen an
Autarch. One could only imagine how difficult it would be to actually
get an Autarch to help out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are these fruits
enough?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Emperor
Goldisle laughed. “Not even close. Not even close! A hundred times
this amount of fruit still wouldn’t be enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want an
Autarch to revive your Dao-companion… if you actually owned the
Crimsonwave Temple and offered it to an Autarch as a gift, you might
succeed.” Hegemon Brightshore shook his head and laughed. “The
fruits you have ripen every few thousand chaos cycles. Crimsonwave
Temple can produce more and more fruit unto perpetuity.”
Crimsonwave Temple itself was worth far more than a hundred times as
much as all of the fruits Ning had acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Ning
instantly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there’s nothing
I can do right now, right?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. None of us
can do what you ask. Only an Autarch can.” Hegemon Brightshore
looked at Ning. “But at least there is hope. If your Dao-companion
was at the World level or was a Samsara Daolord, the backlash
generated by reviving them would be exponentially greater. By then,
you would have no chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
quickly calmed down again. Prior to speaking to these major powers
for the first time regarding the revival of Yu Wei, Ning had already
mentally prepared himself for failure. Others might feel despair at
this response… but Ning was actually filled with vigor! This was
because he was still just a Daolord of the Third Step. Once he became
a Daolord of the Fourth Step and further improved his [Heartsword]
arts, he might indeed be able to acquire treasures that were as
valuable as Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What if I was really
able to acquire something as valuable as Crimsonwave Temple?” Ning
couldn’t help but ask this follow-up question. “How would I go
find out an Autarch then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wouldn’t need
to,” Emperor Goldisle said. “The Dao Alliance would help you send
the word to the Autarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning glanced
at Emperor Goldisle in surprise. The Dao Alliance’s resources truly
were unfathomable. It was actually capable of sending information to
an Autarch?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But remember, given
that Crimsonwave Temple is capable of giving birth to a new crop of
fruits every few thousand chaos cycles or so, its value is far
greater than that of the fruits you have acquired thus far. In fact,
it’s worth much more than all of the treasures I’ve accumulated
over the course of countless years.” Hegemon Brightshore smiled as
he looked at Ning. “Darknorth, it won’t be easy for you to
acquire something as valuable as Crimsonwave Temple. You need to
mentally prepare yourself for this task.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to reap
great rewards, you’ll need to be prepared for taking on great
dangers,” Hegemon Windrain said. “For example, the Terror
Starsea. The Terror Starsea was part of the Dawn War’s battlefield
and is filled with many leftover relics and treasures, but it’s
also filled with countless dangers. If you are willing and able to
take on the necessary risk, you might be able to find Hegemon-level
relics or even powerful treasures left behind by the Sithe race. It’s
entirely possible that you’ll find something as valuable as
Crimsonwave Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three mighty
Hegemons didn’t dare to take on too much risk without a good
reason, as they were the pillars of their respective organizations.
The Terror Starsea was simply too dangerous; even Hegemons might die
in there if they were unlucky. The negative repercussions were simply
too grave, which was why it was generally only the Daolords who dared
to risk it. Daolords only stood an ephemeral chance of succeeding at
the Daomerge anyhow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs, eh?”
Ning silently reflected on this term. Autarchs, the most supreme
existences of the cultivation world, the leaders who led the
cultivators to victory over the Sithe…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are unable to
reverse spacetime and revive your Dao-companion. Darknorth, what else
do you plan to trade your fruits for?” Hegemon Brightshore asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak, Darknorth.
What do you need?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just state your
requests.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Goldisle,
Hegemon Windrain, and the others all looked at Ning as they spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since reviving Yu Wei
was impossible for now, he would have to focus on further
strengthening himself. Only then would he stand a chance at acquiring
a treasure equivalent to Crimsonwave Temple in value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors.” Ning
waved his finger, causing a series of runes to fly out. The many
runes listed the various materials needed for Ning to train in the
second and third levels of the [Sword Dao Body], the protective
divine ability Ning had acquired from the deceased Sword Hegemon.
There were four levels to this divine ability, and once reached it
would allow Ning’s body to become comparable to the best Eternal
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, take a look
at these materials. How much fruit do I need to give up for them?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The three
Hegemons and three leading Emperors all stared at the list, as did
some of the other Eternal Emperors behind them who had yet to even
speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. I’ll only need
sixty of the coldflame cauldron fruits for this,” Hegemon
Netherlily said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll only need
forty-five of the same.” Emperor Goldisle of the Dao Alliance
smiled. The three mighty Hegemons and the other Emperors instantly
looked at him in irritation. The items which Ning had requested were
all extraordinary; as they saw it, at least fifty coldflame cauldron
fruits would be necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Goldisle,
you are going a bit too far. Yes, your Dao Alliance has many
treasures, but how can you give such a low offer?” Emperor Islehide
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How are we even
supposed to compete if you are going to act like this?” Hegemon
Windrain complained in a rumbling voice as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Emperor
Goldisle laughed loudly. “We agreed early on that we’d compete
fairly with each other. I’m doing just that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gawked at the
sight. He also noticed that although Crimsonwave Temple had produced
nine types of fruit, all of the Emperors were focused on the ninth
fruit, the coldflame cauldron fruits. This made Ning realize just how
especially attractive these particular fruits were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, I’ve
harvested eight types of fruit on this trip,” Ning said. “I’m
willing to use the ‘purepeace fruit’ to trade for the materials I
just requested. Might I ask how many are necessary?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The purepeace fruit
ripened every 30,000 chaos cycles. Ning had 108,000 of them!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - Entering the Dao Alliance’s Palace of Immortals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Purepeace fruit?”
The three Hegemons and three Eternal Emperors exchanged glances.
Although all nine of the types of fruit in Crimsonwave Temple were
valuable, there were still differences between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The purepeace fruits,
for example, ripened every 30,000 chaos cycles. There were 108,000 of
them in each harvest. They were fairly numerous, and so the
Flamedragon Realmverse’s six major powers were still able to
acquire it through other channels. As a result, they weren’t all
that desperate to acquire it. The coldflame cauldron fruits, however,
only ripened once every 100,000 chaos cycles… and each time, only
300 were available during each harvest. As a result, people who
acquired them would usually keep and use them for themselves! Very
few were willing to trade them away, making them quite a hot
commodity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the materials
you need? 80,000 of the purepeace fruits will do,” Emperor Goldisle
said with a chuckle. “These things are still quite rare. They have
their uses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Hegemons,
Emperor Severfive, and Emperor Islehide were silent. Seeing this, Ji
Ning understood that Emperor Goldisle had offered him quite a decent
price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
revealed a smile. “Then I’ll give 80,000 of the purepeace fruits
to Emperor Goldisle. Seniors, there are other treasures I need as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another block of text
appeared in midair. This list included the materials needed to train
in the first two stages of the secret art which the Sword Hegemon had
provided to Ning, the [Grand Diffraction Sword] technique. To Ning,
although a protective divine ability was very important, a strong
secret art was even more important. Ning had already pretty much
squeezed as much power as he could out of the nine novessence arts;
by the time he became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, they simply
wouldn’t be able to keep up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Grand Diffraction
Sword] consisted of three stages. The cost to fully master it would
place a heavy burden upon even Hegemons; Ning felt that he probably
didn’t have enough fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, to master
all three stage one had to have reached an extremely high level of
skill in the Dao of the Sword. Most likely, one would have to reach a
level comparable to that of the deceased Sword Hegemon first. Thus,
the first two stages were more than enough for Ning for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These materials…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Hegemons and
three Emperors all hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me all 300 of
the coldflame cauldron fruits and I’ll help you collect them,”
Emperor Islehide said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Islehide is
able to acquire all these items? Impressive!” Hegemon Netherlily
laughed softly. “298 coldflame cauldron fruits, my young friend
Darknorth, and I’ll help you collect them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, I’m
willing to use these types of fruit to trade for them instead.” As
Ning spoke, he caused seven different types of fruit to appear before
him. These were the fruits corresponding to the first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh command talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a clever boy.”
The three Hegemons and the three Emperors all laughed. They could
tell that Ning realized how enticing the coldflame cauldron fruits
were to them and thus wasn’t in a rush to sell them off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After extensive
negotiations the Dao Alliance, the Brightshore Kingdom, the
Aberrants, and the Aeonians jointly produced the materials necessary,
taking away more than half of Ning’s fruits in recompense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, all Ning had were:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">300 of the coldflame
cauldron fruits from the ninth talisman; <BR> 28,000 of the purepeace
fruits from the first talisman; <BR> 230 of the golden sandsifter
fruits from the seventh talisman; <BR> 310 of the darkheaven
yin-fruits from the sixth talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, I’ve
pretty much listed all the treasures I need,” Ning said. “I plan
on paying a visit to the Palace of Immortals to see what they have in
their treasury.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, our treasury
in the Palace of Immortals has everything within it. The Dao Alliance
definitely has more treasures than anyone else,” Emperor Goldisle
said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t going
to trade anything else?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Hegemons,
Emperor Severfive, and Emperor Islehide were all startled. Ning was
going to stop trading and instead go straight to the Palace of
Immortals of the Dao Alliance? It must be remembered that thus far,
he hadn’t produced a single one of the coldflame cauldron fruits,
the most valuable of the nine fruits!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Hegemon Brightshore looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly
explained, “Hegemon… seniors… my lifeblood weapons need to grow
and to consume more materials, but I don’t know exactly what they
need. That’s why I wish to go to the Palace of Immortals, so that I
can test out the various materials! Once I’ve selected the
materials I need, I’ll naturally notify all of you and allow the
auction to proceed fairly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lifeblood weapons?”
All of them now understood, as they had lifeblood weapons as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point wasting
time. Come, let’s go to my Palace of Immortals right away,”
Emperor Goldisle said with a smile. He then glanced at the others.
“Hegemons, Emperors, you can come along with us… the Palace of
Immortals will treat you with the utmost of courtesy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We wouldn’t dare
enter the Palace of Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll wait outside
of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various figures
immediately began to depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, follow
me.” Emperor Goldisle smiled as he sent a spatial bubble out to
cover Ning, then tore through space and departed with Ning in tow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of Immortals
was an incomparably mysterious place. Ning had heard of it long ago,
but he had never seen it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are,
Darknorth.” Emperor Goldisle’s voice rang out. Ning stared
towards the front, stunned. In front of him was an absolutely
enormous group of palaces that hung in the middle of space, radiating
blinding light and a mighty aura. The radiance was so dazzling that
Ning was truly dazed by it, while the power contained within the aura
caused Ning’s heart to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
One figure after another appeared next to Ning. They were Hegemon
Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, Emperor Severfive,
and Emperor Islehide, as well as the subordinates they had brought
with them. Ninedust and Winesage had been brought over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Ninedust’s voice rang out within Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust.” Ning
glanced at Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m embarrassed to
say this, but…” Ninedust revealed an awkward look. “The Hegemon
instructed me to ask you to at least sell some of the coldflame
cauldron fruit to us Ancient cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile
as he sent mentally, “Got it. Don’t worry.” Ninedust was his
brother; since he had made the request, Ning knew what to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Winesage sent a mental message as well, a similarly awkward look on
his face. “Darknorth, our Dark Kingdom is constantly beset by
dangers. Just staying alive is difficult. I’d like to ask you to
sell some of those coldflame cauldron fruits to the Dark Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as the Dark
Kingdom has the items I need, that won’t be a problem,” Ning
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore
looked at Ning as well. “Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Hegemon. I know what to do,” Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Favors and friendships
were important, but being fair and even-handed as possible was just
as important, as was growing more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me lead you
inside, Darknorth.” Emperor Goldisle guided Ning in, with Ning
staring everywhere in curiosity as they flew into the Palace of
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the Hegemons or
Emperors present were worried that the Dao Alliance would play a
dirty trick like killing Ning to steal his treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, although
these fruits were rare they weren’t so important as to cause
Hegemons or the Dao Alliance to not care about face. Only something
as valuable as Crimsonwave Temple itself could possibly do that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Secondly, only Daolords
could harvest the fruits that ripened every few tens of thousands of
chaos cycles from Crimsonwave Temple! If the Hegemons or the Dao
Alliance dared to murder Ning, which Daolords in the future would be
willing to take on the risk of helping them go harvest fruit?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lastly, these things
were a gift from Emperor Waveshift to his homeland. It was also a way
to help his homeland temper its Daolords! If the Hegemons or the Dao
Alliance dared to act rashly and angered Emperor Waveshift through
their actions, Emperor Waveshift could very well take the entire
temple back and ensure they would gain nothing at all in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For all of these
reasons, everyone knew that everyone else would play by the rules.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insides of the
Palace of Immortals were absolutely lovely. The light of formations
glimmered everywhere, while their aura was so mighty as to ensure
that even Hegemons wouldn’t dare to trespass within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures of the
Flamedragon Realmverse aside, the treasury of the Palace of Immortals
has collected many treasures from other realmverses as well,”
Emperor Goldisle said with a smile. “It’s hard to even count how
many treasures we have. Choose whatever you like, Darknorth. We’ll
give you what you need for those fruits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is Daolord
Darknorth?” A deep voice boomed out from afar as a black-robed,
black-haired old man walked towards them across the celestial
pathways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Goldisle made
the introductions: “Darknorth, this is Emperor Blackcloud! The two
of us jointly administer the Palace of Immortals for the Dao
Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. So it was these two Emperors who were in control of the
Palace of Immortals? Perhaps they were a bit weaker than the
Hegemons, but they were actually even more influential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you’ve only trained for such a short period of time but have
reached such incredible heights in power. Impressive.” Emperor
Blackcloud smiled. “Goldisle and I shall open the treasury for you
to peruse as you please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble, seniors,” Ning said modestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While chatting, these
two leaders of the Dao Alliance led Ning to the location of the
treasury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.” Emperor
Blackcloud waved a finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white stone door in
front of him began to split apart, revealing a dark passageway
inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasury is an
important place, and so this passageway is filled with many barriers
and wards. Not even Hegemons would dare to trespass here,” Emperor
Blackcloud said smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, Darknorth.”
Emperor Goldisle led the way, with Ning following from behind. In
truth, the reason why they dared to open up the treasury like this
for Ning was because Ning was weak; if a Hegemon had actually come
here, there was no way they would’ve dared to let the Hegemon
actually enter the treasury.

Chapter 4 - Treasures the Northbow Swords Need
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning followed
Emperor Goldisle and Emperor Blackcloud through the dark passageway.
After walking for a short while, he finally saw yet another stone
door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open,” Emperor
Blackcloud command. The stone door instantly sank downwards,
revealing the vast treasury behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ning felt
dizzy when he saw what was behind the stone door. He was able to
sense many varied auras, some brutal, some cold, some stately…
countless treasures were hanging there, so numerous that at a glance
Ning was able to see tens of millions of treasures just with the
naked eye alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All treasures stored
within our treasury are quite extraordinary.” Emperor Goldisle
smiled. “Many treasures here are one-of-a-kind! But of course,
there are also some that are quite numerous, in which case we’ll
just put a single sample item here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors,” Ning
said hurriedly, “My lifeblood weapons need to personally touch the
treasures in order to sense if they can make use of them or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just touching is
fine,” Emperor Goldisle said solemnly, “But don’t damage
anything. Some of the treasures here are incredibly valuable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please don’t
worry. My lifeblood weapons wouldn’t dare,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Emperor
Blackcloud laughed. “Go, then. Inspect them to your heart’s
content.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Come
out,” Ning willed mentally. Swish! Swish! Swish! All six Northbow
swords flew out from their scabbards, and as they did so an adorable
child appeared from each of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master!”
All six children began to call out repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up. This
treasury is filled with countless treasures. You can touch them to
sense which are of use to you,” Ning said, “But remember, you
absolutely must not damage any of them, nor are you allowed to absorb
any of them. After the inspection is complete, with any luck, I’ll
be able to give you some treasures to absorb.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, don’t
worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to us!”
All six Northbow sword-spirits were quite excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning
immediately sent them flying into the skies towards the various
treasures, which they began to sscan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This vast treasury was
filled with long stone tables that were covered with countless
treasures. There were also incredibly long twelve-layered treasure
shelves, with each layer filled with many treasures. The ones placed
on the shelves were clearly less valuable! There were also individual
stone daises that held only a single treasure each.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place had all
sorts of weapons, even Universe weapons! There were all sorts of
marvelous treasures here, including many strange curios that had been
collected from the Terror Starsea…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed on,
one minute at a time. Ning continued to furiously send his six
Northbow swords flying everywhere, touching the various treasures.
After roughly the time needed to boil a kettle of tea…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master! I
can sense that if I ate this flower, it would be of big use to me,”
Northbow Five called out spiritually to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up as
he immediately looked towards the sword. This was a semi-ethereal
flower that was surrounded by a faint gray aura. There was a jade
slip next to it that introduced it as the ‘shadowless six-thief
flower’. It was capable of hiding itself amongst other objects,
making it extremely difficult to find. It was an incomparably
marvelous item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many of those
can you eat?” Ning asked spiritually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not sure. At
least ten thousand,” Northbow Five replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Got it.” Ning
nodded, silently memorizing this flower. He then continued to search
for other treasures. This treasury most likely had copies of almost
all of the decent treasures located within the Flamedragon
Realmverse! When would he ever have another chance like this to just
scan them as he pleased? Even if he wasn’t able to acquire what he
needed due to not having enough fruit, he could at least memorize
them for future collection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Palace of
Immortals. Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily,
Emperor Severfive, and Emperor Islehide continued to wait patiently
alongside their retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightshore,”
Hegemon Windrain said hurriedly, “The Dao Alliance wouldn’t be
playing a trick on our young friend Darknorth, would they? If he ends
up trading with them without giving us a chance…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.
Brightshore…” Emperor Islehide said hurriedly, “Darknorth
belongs to your Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Hegemon Brightshore smiled. “I can reach out to Darknorth at any
time! He’s currently within the treasury of the Palace of
Immortals, scanning the countless treasures there. This process will
take some time, so don’t be impatient. Once he knows which
treasures he needs, he’ll publicly announce it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. At least we
can compete fairly,” Emperor Severfive said. All of them were truly
the most elite figures of the Endless Territories, but this
competition over the coldflame cauldron fruits still made them
nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a rough,
accepted ‘value’ to these fruits, but they were simply never
available for sale. Very, very few were willing to sell these fruits,
which was why in normal times the Hegemons were willing to pay
multiples of the ‘accepted’ value for the few coldflame cauldron
fruits which appeared from time to time! Now that Crimsonwave Temple
was going to be located within the Endless Territories indefinitely,
they’d be able to harvest 300 of the fruits every 100,000 chaos
cycles. This was why they hadn’t offered excessively high prices in
their negotiations with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… they also
understood that the future couldn’t be predicted. Who knew when
Emperor Waveshift would end up taking the temple away again?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the treasury of
the Palace of Immortals of the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
control his six Northbow swords, sending them flying about like
streaks of light towards various treasures, then gently brushing
against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master! I
can sense that this stone is going to help me out a lot!” Northbow
Three called out as well. Ning immediately memorized the stone in
question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time he had
nearly finished a complete scan of all the treasures within the
treasury, he had already discovered a total of twelve treasures that
would be of use to his Northbow swords! However, the Northbow swords
would devour absolutely enormous amounts of material as they grew.
Ning worried as to whether or not this would even be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, after roughly
ten hours of scanning, Ning had finished his first review of all the
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
Emperor Goldisle and Emperor Blackcloud both looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really are
quite a few treasures that are useful to my lifeblood weapons,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which treasures do
you need? Go ahead and tell us and we’ll try to help you collect
them as best we can,” Emperor Goldisle said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should probably
say it outside,” Ning replied hurriedly. “The Hegemon reminded me
long ago that we have to keep things fair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Right, right.
Fair.” Emperor Blackcloud and Emperor Goldisle exchanged a glance,
rather resigned. In the end, Ning belonged to the Brightshore
Kingdom, making Hegemon Brightshore’s instructions quite effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Blackcloud and
Emperor Goldisle didn’t really worry too much. Given how filthy
rich the Dao Alliance was, they were quite confident in their
chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Emperor Blackcloud and Emperor Goldisle led Ning in departing from
the treasury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Palace of
Immortals. Ji Ning, Emperor Blackcloud, and Emperor Goldisle flew out
at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There they are.”
The three Hegemons, Emperor Severfive, Emperor Islehide, and the
various retainers all looked towards Ning, their eyes lighting up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The time for the final
negotiations over the coldflame cauldron fruits had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, did you
find any suitable treasures?” Hegemon Brightshore asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I found twelve,”
Ning said. The Hegemons and Emperors were all rather startled by this
answer. Twelve? It seemed likely that everyone would be able to
provide Ning with something he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first is known
as the ‘shadowless six-thief flowers’,” Ning said. “I need at
least ten thousand of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The shadowless
six-thief flowers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over ten thousand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Hegemons and
the various Emperors exchanged glances, all feeling rather resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, even if
we scraped up all of the shadowless six-thief flowers that the
Flamedragon Realmverse has accumulated over the countless years of
its existence, we would probably only be able to find a few hundred
of them,” Hegemon Brightshore said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Goldisle nodded
as well. “The shadowless six-thief flowers are invisible, hidden
throughout the cosmos. They are extremely hard to find. Although they
aren’t that useful, they really are quite rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt quite
helpless upon hearing this. If the Northbow swords were to grow, they
needed materials in sufficiently large quantities. For example, they
had absorbed a terrifying amount of that golden sand! Based on what
the Northbow sword-spirit had predicted, he would need at least ten
thousand of those flowers, but it seemed as though Ning wouldn’t
even be able to acquire a tenth of that. Such a small amount would be
of limited benefit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second type of
treasure is known as the flamebearer tathata-metal,” Ning said.
“I’ll need a mountain of it, a mountain which is roughly thirty
thousand meters tall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty thousand
meters tall?” The Hegemons and Emperors sighed again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are asking for
too much. Flamebearer tathata-metal is used in palm-sized chunks for
forging treasures. You want a mountain of it?” Emperor Goldisle
shook his head. “There’s no way to get that much in the
Flamedragon Realmverse. If the Dao Alliance was willing to pay
incredible prices to have other realmverses help out and deliver
them, we might be able to do it… but the coldflame cauldron fruits
in your possession aren’t nearly enough to trade for a mountain of
the tathata-metal.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 5 - Stone Hellephant Wall
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was speechless.
It was clear that everyone wanted his coldflame cauldron fruits, but
the first two items he had requested, the ‘Six Bandits Shadowless
Flowers’ and the ‘flamebearer tathata-metal’, weren’t
available in the quantities he needed in the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
fully understand was that the Northbow swords needed balance in order
to grow to their maximum potential. They had absorbed such an
enormous amount of that golden sand that they would need similarly
prodigious amounts of other materials to gain that balance and reach
their apex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have twelve
types of treasures you can use, right?” Emperor Islehide said,
“Keep talking. We might be able to provide you with the other
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning had
no choice but to continue with his requests. “The third type of
treasure is known as astral forgestones. I need a three thousand
meter mountain of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t have it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t have
enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where would you even
find that many astral forgestones?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hegemons and
Emperors, along with their retainers, all shook their heads. Most of
the retainers were also Eternal Emperors and as such had seen many
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helpless, Ning had no
choice but to continue listing the things he needed. The fourth type,
the fifth type, the sixth type… nothing, nothing, nothing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simply needed too
much; there was no way to acquire that much at all. The more valuable
an item, the rarer it was, after all. When Ning had visited that
alternate universe and had discovered that vast mountain of darkspace
flamestone, it had been a momentous find, not because of how valuable
the stone itself was, but because of how utterly enormous that
mountain had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same principle
applied here. The various treasures Ning sought were far more
valuable than darkspace flamestone, and he needed an enormous amount
of them; there was just no way to acquire that much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighth type is
known as the frozen ninesong pith,” Ning said. “I’ll need a
lake of it that’s three hundred meters long, wide, and deep.” The
numbers he listed out were still quite shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
coldflame cauldron fruits,” Emperor Severfive immediately called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two hundred and
ninety,” Emperor Goldisle said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two hundred!”
Emperor Islehide growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred and
ninety,” Hegemon Brightshore said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been feeling
increasingly despondent. Now, he stared blankly as the Eternal
Emperors furiously bid down the price. Was this frozen ninesong pith
a very common item?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Goldisle
interjected, “Gentlemen, I think we should stop fighting against
each other as there will be no ‘winner’. Since he’s asking for
frozen ninesong pith, I’m sure that all of us will be able to
provide it in enormous amounts. How about we split it evenly?
Darknorth, give us a hundred and fifty coldflame cauldron fruits, a
hundred and fifty golden sandsifter fruits, and a hundred and fifty
darkheaven yin-fruits. All six of us will jointly procure the
necessary frozen ninesong pith you need! We’ll give you double what
you ask for; a lake of it that’s six hundred meters wide, long, and
deep!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
others all nodded after a brief pause. They understood and agreed
that no one would really ‘win’ this auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, our
Flamedragon Realmverse discovered a river that swirled around a
strange star,” Emperor Goldisle explained. “This river is roughly
a hundred thousand kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide…
and it was filled with frozen ninesong pith. As a result, all six of
us have large stocks of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. A
river that was a hundred thousand kilometers long and hundreds of
kilometers wide? The tiny ‘lake’ he needed was in comparison just
a tiny fraction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can give you six
hundred meters of it. If you need more, we can easily give you a bit
more,” Emperor Goldisle said. They really didn’t care about the
frozen ninesong pith that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and
continue listing what you need,” Emperor Islehide said. “We might
have it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
smiled as he continued to list the items he needed. The ninth, the
tenth, the eleventh… the twelfth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The twelfth is known
as deepfire blackstone. I need a mountain-sized pile roughly three
hundred thousand meters tall.” Ning looked eagerly at the three
Hegemons and the various Hegemons. Thus far, the only treasure they
were able to provide had been was still just the frozen ninesong
pith. The other treasures simply weren’t available.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
thousand meters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s pretty
crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you sure your
lifeblood weapons can swallow that much?” The various Emperors
present couldn’t help but mutter amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew that the
deepfire blackstone was the last of the twelve types of treasures
Ning needed, but the amount was just staggering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t do it.
Deepfire blackstone isn’t all that useful; it’s mainly used for
smelting a few treasures. However, the Endless Territories only has
perhaps a three thousand meter mountain of it.” Emperor Goldisle
shook his head. “You want a three hundred thousand meter mountain.
The difference is just too great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three thousand. Three
hundred thousand. This was a hundredfold difference in height, and a
millionfold difference in total mass!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Ning shook
his head. Three thousand meters? Even if he gained all of it, it
probably wouldn’t be all that beneficial to his Northbow swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all was said and
done, he had acquired all of the materials he needed for the second
and third stages of his [Swordbody] divine ability as well as the
first two stages of the Sword Hegemon’s secret art, [Grand
Diffraction Sword]. Alas, he had only acquired the frozen ninesong
pith for his Northbow swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess that’s
that.” Ning was out of options. He had already negotiated with the
six most powerful organizations in all the Endless Territories, but
had only been able to acquire one of the treasures he needed. One
could imagine how difficult it would be for his Northbow swords to
grow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend,” a voice suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
over, as did the three Hegemons and the Eternal Emperors. The speaker
was an ordinary-looking horned youth who stood behind Hegemon
Brightshore. When the horned youth spoke his aura immediately
changed, exploding in might and reaching an utterly astonishing
level. The terrifying, awe-inspiring aura around him was definitely
that of a Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Hegemon?” Ning,
Ninedust, and Winesage were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The other
Eternal Emperors of the Flamedragon Realmverse were all astonished as
well. Everyone knew that the Flamedragon Realmverse only had three
almighty Hegemons within it. Where did this one come from?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned youth
glanced at the assembled Emperors of the Flamedragon Realmverse, then
explained, “My name is Welkin. I’ve wandered through the Great
Dark and visited many realmverses, and I ended up slumbering within
the Flamedragon Realmverse for a period of time due to having
sustained a few injuries. The only reason I woke up was because of
Crimsonwave Temple’s emergence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Welkin was
planning to leave secretly,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “It was
Crimsonwave Temple that drew him out of hiding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon Welkin? So
you are Welkin?” Hegemon Netherlily smiled. “I’ve heard of your
illustrious name long ago, but I never had the chance to meet you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, Welkin!”
Hegemon Windrain revealed a smile as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Hegemons naturally
felt respect for their peers. They all stood at the very peak of
power amongst Eternal Emperors! But of course, those who were lucky
enough to take control over an alternate universe and become known as
Otherverse Lords were somewhat more powerful than even Hegemons in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A good example was the
alternate universe Ning had visited. The lord of the Church of
Annihilation hadn’t been at the Hegemon level; he had merely been
comparable to the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. After a stroke of
tremendous fortune, he had ended up in control of that otherverse and
as a result become an Otherverse Lord, resulting in his status and
his power skyrocketing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t want to
get involved in this,” Hegemon Welkin said with a smile, “But
since our young friend Darknorth spoke of deepfire blackstone… I’m
actually able to help you out here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Ning revealed
a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me a hundred
coldflame cauldron fruits, and I’ll give you plenty of deepfire
blackstone ore,” Hegemon Welkin said. “I’m not asking for
much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other three
Hegemons and other Eternal Emperors all felt rather resigned. They
simply weren’t able to provide enough of the deepfire blackstone!
Hegemon Welkin, however, was different; he was a wanderer who had
visited many places and who knew much more than them. They weren’t
surprised by the fact that he was able to provide this much deepfire
blackstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
nodded. “A hundred coldflame cauldron fruits it is.” Hegemon
Welkin was the only person who could provide the ore in question.
Even if he had requested all of the remaining fruits, Ning would’ve
been in a difficult position to bargain from. The Hegemon was being
quite courteous by only requesting a hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. The deepspace
blackstone can be found in a place known as the Stone Hellephant
Wall. This is a strange, curious place that I stumbled upon while I
was travelling to your Flamedragon Realmverse, and it’s quite close
by it. But of course, if I didn’t guide the way you’d never be
able to find it.” Hegemon Welkin smiled. “I’ll personally
escort you there. It’ll take roughly nine years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t playing
a trick on Darknorth, are you?” Emperor Goldisle frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll naturally
swear a lifeblood oath,” Hegemon Welkin said. Upon hearing this,
the other Eternal Emperors fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to feel a
sense of eagerness in his heart. The ‘Stone Hellephant Wall’, eh?
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - Arrangements
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full two years went
by as the six major powers of the Endless Territories gathered the
various treasures which Ji Ning needed, at which point in time Ning
gave them the agreed-upon fruits. This was actually quite fast, given
how vast the Endless Territories were. There were quite a few
treasures which the three Hegemons and the various Eternal Emperors
didn’t actually have on hand, with the collection process naturally
taking some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After acquiring all of
the materials needed, Ning and Ninedust accompanied Hegemon Welkin on
the journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning, Ninedust,
and Hegemon Welkin were seated within a dazzling deep-blue vessel
that was flying through the darkness of space at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Welkin.”
Ning glanced outside. They were now quite close to the Badlands
Territory. “Can we halt for now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Hegemon
Welkin immediately brought the vessel to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a few things
to take care of,” Ning said. “After going to this Stone
Hellephant Wall and acquiring enough of the deepfire blackstone,
Ninedust and I will continue our adventures. I need to make some
arrangements for my retainers and take care of some things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust had only
recently become a Daolord of the Fourth Step. Although he had used a
Voidsea Jadeseal, he still wasn’t confident in his Daomerge chances
and thus had to continue his adventures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning himself, he
wanted to acquire a treasure that was comparable to Crimsonwave
Temple in value, so that he would be able to request an Autarch to
revive Yu Wei. It must be remembered that Crimsonwave Temple was
worth more than the total networth of an average Hegemon. If he
wanted to acquire something like that… where else but through
adventure would this be possible?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Hegemon
Welkin nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a single step
out of the flying vessel and appeared in the empty space outside. He
waved his hand. Whoosh. Four figures immediately appeared next to
him. These were Su Youji, Pillsaint, Daolord Naia, and Daolord
Bruteflame. The four retainers looked at Ning, then called out
respectfully, “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at them, a
rather complex look on his face. He said with a sigh, “You have all
accompanied for many years now. Youji, you started following me when
I was an Elder God. Pillsaint, we met when we were World Gods in the
Brightshore Kingdom…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
couldn’t help but interject, “Why are you saying…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I can sense that
the places I am going to go visit are far too dangerous for you,”
Ning said. “That last trip to the Terror Starsea was a good
example, as was our visit to the Waveshift Realm. Both places were
incredibly dangerous. If I survived them, you would be fine, but if I
didn’t then you probably would’ve all died there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and Pillsaint
seemed to want to say something. Daolord Naia and Daolord Bruteflame
exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint, for
example, has chosen the path of the Dao of Alchemy. There’s
absolutely no need for him to go out adventuring,” Ning said with a
smile. “He should find a good place to peacefully train in alchemy.
And you, Youji… by following me like this you yourself aren’t
adventuring at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a result…”
Ning looked at the four of them. “The four of you should all go out
adventuring. If you wish to speak to me, go to Vastheaven Palace. My
avatar will be there permanently.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Take
these treasures. You can consider them lifesavers.” Ning waved his
hand, causing four gourds to fly out towards Su Youji and the others.
Ning had won quite a bit from this trip to the Waveshift Realm. He
had killed the Kingfreak, Sectlord Timedream, and quite a few
second-tier Daolords… and had also gained many treasures from
Winesage. As a result, he had a prodigious number of treasures on
hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Su Youji the
best treasures and Pillsaint the second-best treasures, with Daolord
Bruteflame and Daolord Naia gaining the least. There was a difference
in how much he cared about them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
and Pillsaint were rather unwilling to part from him, while Daolord
Naia and Daolord Bruteflame were rather calm. The latter two had been
alive for extremely long and had experienced many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji, Pillsaint,
Naia, and Bruteflame traded glances. In the end, they had no choice
but to leave. They too understood that this was the best choice for
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint, where
shall you go?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to
Vastheaven Palace,” Pillsaint said. “All I need is a place to
concoct pills. Since our master’s avatar will be in Vastheaven
Palace, that’s the best place for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I’ll go there
as well.” Su Youji nodded. Avatars shared the same thoughts and
memories as true bodies, after all. Su Youji wanted to stay a bit
closer to Ning if possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as Su
Youji, Pillsaint, and the others left. With them gone, he relaxed
slightly. Bidding them farewell was the most responsible thing he
could do for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
finger, causing a blurry, rainbow spacetime tunnel to instantly
appear in front of him. Ning took a single step into the tunnel,
immediately vanishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ninedust,
still seated within the vessel, glanced outside in surprise. Just a
few moments ago, he had seen Ning bidding his four retainers
farewell. Now, Ning had suddenly entered a spacetime tunnel and
vanished. “Where’d he go?” Ninedust said with some surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Off to take care of
some random tasks, no doubt.” Hegemon Welkin was quite calm. “My
guess is that Darknorth’s home is within the Badlands Territory, as
we’re fairly close to it. Given his ability to transcend spacetime,
he should be able to reach that territory in just a few seconds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
nodded. A few moments later, a rather mixed look appeared on his face
as he murmured softly, “At least Darknorth has random tasks he
needs to take care of and a beloved Dao-companion he has to revive.
I… don’t seem to have any family, nor do I have a Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ancient cultivators did
not have parents, as they were born from the primordial chaos itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
whoosh. A spacetime tunnel appeared, with a white-robed youth bearing
a golden sheath on his back stepping out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There you are.”
Ninedust cast away his pensive thoughts and called out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
Just now, he had paid a quick visit to his Primaltwin in the Badlands
Territory. He had handed many of the treasures he had acquired within
the Waveshift Realm over to his Primaltwin, as many of them were now
of no use to Ning but of tremendous use to the Three Realms. There
were many valuable pills, including the ‘Soleheart World Pill’
that could allow someone to forcibly break through to the World
level. There were even Pseudo Samsara Pills that could allow someone
to break through to become to Samsara Daolords! To truly powerful
Daolords like him, these pills truly were nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning’s current
status, for him to forcibly uplift a number of World-level
cultivators was quite an easy task. However, he wouldn’t do so
without cause. Only those who broke through on their own with hard
work would be able to walk farther along their chosen paths. Those
who made their breakthroughs via relying on Pseudo Samsara Pills to
become Samsara Daolords were virtually guaranteed to remain Daolords
of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to have
troubled you.” Ning looked at Hegemon Welkin. “I’ve finished
everything I need to do. I can now go out with some peace of mind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really envy
youngsters like you.” Hegemon Welkin sighed. “Long, long ago,
when I was still very weak, I had some friends who accompanied me as
well. However… all of them died. None of them were able to succeed
in their Daomerge. They died far, far too long ago… and I’m the
only one left. That’s why I’ve gone out wandering through various
realmverse and otherverses. Only by seeing many new places do I feel
that life has any meaning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance. Indeed… in life, one needed to have goals.
Otherwise, eternal loneliness would be a form of torment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Brightshore,
for example, was completely focused on his imperial clan and his
descendants. Although it was tiring work, it gave him something to
do. As for Samsara Daolords… they focused on adventuring and the
Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Eternal Emperors,
their endless lifespans were a source of frustration. This was why
many of them, such as Emperor Mirrorsnow and Emperor Heartsword, had
ended up leaving and going off wandering. Their curiosity towards
what else lay within the Chaosverse was what sustained them and gave
them energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually… we
Daolords envy you as well,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Even in my
dreams I fantasize about succeeding in my Daomerge and becoming a
Hegemon,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Hegemon
Welkin laughed loudly. “Every single stage of cultivation has its
own sights to enjoy. Life as a Samsara Daolord is one of the most
glorious, exciting stages of them all. Work hard, youngsters. If you
can break through to become Hegemons, we might meet again in the
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might meet again in
the future?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I send you off
to the Stone Hellephant Wall, I’ll leave and continue my
wanderings,” Hegemon Welkins aid. “Wandering through the
Chaosverse and seeing everything there is to see… to me, that’s
the most interesting thing there is. It’ll be long, long time
before I come back to the Flamedragon Realmverse. If you don’t
become Hegemons, it’s unlikely that we’ll meet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
Ninedust both nodded. To someone who was as infinitely long-lived as
Hegemon Welkin, 108,000 chaos cycles really was a short period of
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Welkin once
more took control over the flying vessel, sending it tearing through
spacetime. As for Ning, he secluded himself within his own
estate-world and began to train once more. It would take nine years
to reach the Stone Hellephant Wall, after all. This would be more
than enough time for him to grow significantly more powerful yet
again!

Chapter 7 - The Stone Wall in the Darkness
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.” Ji Ning was
standing at the peak of a mountain, staring down at the vast
wilderness before him. He waved his finger, and with a boom an
invisible surge of pressure slammed down upon the wilderness, causing
an enormous indentation to appear on the ground. The indentation was
nine hundred meters deep! Ning then reached out with his right hand,
causing a small little black gourd to appear. He pulled out the
stopper, causing a stream of deep blue water to flow out from the
gourd. The stream of water grew in size as it flew out until it
became many meters thick, almost like a watery dragon as it soared
out to fill the indentation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The liquid
continuously poured out, quickly filling nearly half of the
indentation. This was the frozen ninesong pith Ning had just recently
acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead, children.”
Ning smiled as the six Northbow swords on his back instantly flew out
of the sheath, each one of them manifesting a child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, frozen
ninesong pith!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the frozen
ninesong pith.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s so much of
it! We can eat as much as we want.” The six Northbow swords were
all extremely excited. Each of them transformed to become nine
hundred meters long, plunging themselves into the pool like
sword-shaped mountains that then began to furiously devour the frozen
ninesong pith.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing his temporal acceleration cabin to appear next to him. He
entered the cabin, then begain to train in the [Swordbody] divine
ability. He now had all the materials he needed, but the actual
training process was very slow because this sort of cultivation
technique placed enormous burdens on his body. He had to take it
slowly and allow the power to slowly seep through. However, at least
these protective divine abilities didn’t require him to focus too
much of his attention on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, he was able to
devote most of his time to meditating on his Omega Sword Dao and the
[Heartsword] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly three months
went past. Ning could sense that his lifeblood weapons had already
finished evolving, and so he walked out of his temporal cabin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northbow swords.”
Ning looked at the six enormous mountain-sized Northbow swords, still
stuck into that giant indentation. Their appearances had changed as
well. They previously were a dazzling pure golden color, but now they
had the color of blue gold. The surfaces of the swords were now very
glossy, with the light of the sword being rather reserved. They
looked almost like pure spring water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Ning
willed the six Northbow swords to fly out, and they quickly flew
towards him while shrinking to their normal size. Five of the
Northbow swords flew into his sheath, while the sixth landed in his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see just how
they’ve changed after absorbing the frozen ninesong pith.” Ning
immediately began to execute his sword-arts, causing sword-light to
shine everywhere and transform the empty area around him into a realm
of the sword. The aura of the Dao of the Sword pervaded every inch of
the area as he began to execute the five stances of the Omega Sword
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning revealed
a look of delight. “The Northbow swords are now both fierce and
flexible, making them of great use to my defensive sword-arts. Both
the Yin-Yang stance and the Soleheart stance have improved
significantly; I imagine that both of them are five times as powerful
as previously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yin-Yang stance
could be used to execute the Yin-Yang Sword Domain with all six
swords, making it an excellent area defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Soleheart stance
was focused on single-target defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was to fight
against Winesage again, I could fight him head-on. My defensive
sword-arts would be able to easily ablate and deflect his power. At
least I wouldn’t be sent flying this time!” Ning revealed a look
of delight. In a deadly situation, defensive sword-arts were even
more important than offensive attacks. The power of your attacks
would determine the fate of others, but the power of your defenses
would determine the fate of yourself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll be reaching
the Stone Hellephant Wall soon. By then we’ll be able to absorb
plenty of the deepfire blackstone, and my Northbow swords should only
grow even more powerful.” Ning grew increasingly eager to see what
would happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The growth of any
lifeblood weapon would be tied to the treasures they devoured. The
majority of supreme Daolords all used lifeblood weapons, but very few
of them would be able to acquire as many treasures as this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t a good
example; neither the sea of golden sand nor the lake of frozen
ninesong pith were things which ordinary supreme Daolords were
capable of acquiring. However, Eternal Emperors had very long lives,
with Hegemons possessing tremendous power; as a result, their
lifeblood weapons were usually very powerful. Daolord Dreamlore’s
bloodblade, for example, had once been a lifeblood weapon that had
reached an incredible level of power. From a material level, it
absolutely had the potential to become a Universe treasure… but
alas, the Dao inside it was slightly lacking and thus it wasn’t
able to reach this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Welkin’s
flying vessel had long ago departed from the Flamedragon Realmverse
and entered the endless Great Dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Great Dark… there
were no stars here, no light… nothing at all. There was nothing but
darkness! Darkness, enough of it to cause even Eternal Emperors to
feel despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the Great
Dark did have some foreign objects floating about within it. Daolord
Clevermind of the Ninedust Sect, for example, had seen those six
great warhammers floating about within the Great Dark as he had
travelled around its borders. This was why he had been lucky enough
to acquire them. Thus, the Great Dark wasn’t truly devoid of all
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.”
Hegemon Welkin finally brought the flying vessel to a halt. It had
indeed taken nine years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
come out now.” Hegemon Welkin glanced at the two estate-treasures
next to him. Ning and Ninedust had both secreted themselves into
their estate-worlds. With a giant booming sound, an invisible spatial
wave slammed straight into the two estate-treasures, causing the
estate-worlds to tremble. Soon, Ning and Ninedust both emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you
really do seize every moment,” Hegemon Welkin said with a laugh.
“You’ve been furiously training for every day of the past nine
years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I gained quite a bit
from my visit to Crimsonwave Temple. I naturally had to seize this
chance to train,” Ninedust said hurriedly. He then looked at Ning.
“Darknorth, you traded for quite a few treasures from the Hegemons
and Eternal Emperors. You’ve probably grown quite a bit stronger as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m doing
alright.” Ning nodded. He had only been able to train his body to
make it comparable to a middle-grade Eternal treasure, primarily
because the protective divine ability placed incredible demands and
burdens on the body. He had to take it slow; if he did it too fast
and tried to force things, his divine body would crumble and his
truesoul would crumble with it. Thus, he had to train slowly even
though he already had all the materials needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re not too far
away from the Flamedragon Realmverse,” Hegemon Welkin said. “The
two of you should still be able to sense it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can.” Ning and
Ninedust both nodded. Ning could sense exactly where his Primaltwin
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend, your sword-arts have transcended spacetime. I brought you
here to the Stone Hellephant Wall, but I think you should be able to
slowly return under your own abilities. Given your power, you should
be able to return within a thousand years,” Hegemon Welkin said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter.”
Ning nodded. A thousand years was a very short period of time for
supreme Daolords; he wouldn’t force Hegemon Welkin to wait by his
side for a trifling matter like sending him home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flying
vessel disappeared, causing the three of them to appear within the
empty space of the Great Dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is
nothing but darkness here.” Ning scanned the area, only to see
absolute darkness all around him. There was no light at all; only by
using godsense was he able to ‘see’ the surrounding area, and
there really was nothing whatsoever around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
couldn’t help but ask, “Factoring in my ability to transcend
spacetime… if I were to go drifting through the Great Dark, would
100,000 chaos cycles be enough for me to reach the closest
realmverse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The realmverse
closest to the Flamedragon Realmverse is known as the Multilight
Realmverse. Although your ability to transcend spacetime is
impressive, it will still take roughly a million chaos cycles before
you get there,” Hegemon Welkin said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
shared a glance. Yeah, forget that. Samsara Daolords could spend
their entire lives travelling without making it to the Multilight
Realmverse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
Stone Hellephant Wall,” Ninedust said immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stone Hellephant
Wall is just up ahead. Follow me.” Hegemon Welkin emanated a bubble
that encompassed both Ning and Ninedust, ‘carrying’ them with him
as he flew forwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Hegemon Welkin
was simply too fast, so fast that Ning and Ninedust both felt their
hearts trembled. They were starting to truly understand how
terrifyingly strong Hegemons were. Their speed alone ensured that
supreme Daolords wouldn’t even have a chance to react before dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments later,
they had flown tens of billions of kilometers. “See that?”
Hegemon Welkin pointed up ahead. “That right there is the Stone
Hellephant Wall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards the
front. A colossal object was up ahead, hanging within the endless
darkness. It emanated a natural but dim aura of light that was enough
for supreme Daolords like Nine and Ninedust to make it out clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thing up ahead was
roughly a million kilometers long and shaped like a giant elephant.
Only, it had what looked like an incredibly sharp horn coming from
its ‘head’. The entire thing was black… or perhaps an
incredibly deep red!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At first glance, it
rather looks like a demonic elephant, doesn’t it?” Hegemon Welkin
said, “But if you move closer, you’ll see that it is actually
very, very thin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and
Ninedust hurriedly moved closer. Indeed, although this enormous thing
was over a million kilometers long, it was merely a thousand
kilometers thick. The thickness was very even.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It… looks almost
like a wall carving someone did,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It looks like
a detached wall carving of an enormous, hellish elephant,” Hegemon
Welkin said. “That’s why I named it the Stone Hellephant Wall.
This thing has been floating in the Great Dark for an extremely long
period of time, and the entire thing is composed of deepfire
blackstone. I was overjoyed when I saw it and wanted to take it with
me, but it was just too big. Some sort of invisible power made it so
that I just couldn’t take it away by force. Your lifeblood weapons
wish to absorb deepfire blackstone, right? Go ahead and let them
absorb as much as they want from this enormous wall of deepfire
blackstone. Now… we agreed on a hundred coldfire cauldron fruits.
Go ahead and give them to me.”

Chapter 8 - Mining
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning glanced at the
enormous Stone Hellephant Wall. “Senior, please let me first see if
I can even absorb it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the Northbow
swords flew out from the sheath on Ning’s back and stabbed straight
towards the Stone Hellephant Wall. Crack! The Northbow sword didn’t
damage the wall in the slightest, but as it hung there with the sword
tip touching the wall, everyone present could see that a small
‘crater’ was slowly beginning to appear and expand at the point
of contact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this is
deepfire blackstone. We can absorb it!” a child appeared on the
surface of the Northbow sword and called out excitedly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but reveal a smile. He turned his head to look at Hegemon Welkin.
“Thank you, senior. Here are your hundred coldflame cauldron
fruits.” Ning sent out a jade bottle with a hundred fruits within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemon Welkin accepted
it, scanned it with his godsense, then accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can just take
your time absorbing the deepfire blackstone. I’m off.” Hegemon
Welkin’s gaze turned towards the Northbow sword that had slowly
plunged deep into the Stone Hellephant Wall; by now, quite a bit of
the deepfire blackstone had disappeared from around it. “Even I am
not able to take away this enormous chunk of deepfire blackstone, but
your swords are able to absorb it… haha. Still, upgrading lifeblood
weapons is an incredibly difficult process. Even if you can let them
absorb an enormous amount of materials and upgrade them to their
material limit, if you wish to transform them into Universe treasures
then they will need quintessence cores that are at a similarly
incredible level. I’ve reared lifeblood weapons of my own, but alas
I haven’t been able to create any Universe treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded upon
hearing this. Creating a Universe treasure was no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To me, searching for
an ownerless Universe treasure is a better use of my time,” Hegemon
Welkin said. “There are still some who would be willing to
acknowledge me as master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That, senior, is
because you are a Hegemon!” The nearby Ninedust interjected, “It
is normall for Universe treasures to be willing to submit themselves
to Hegemons. Daolords like us though? Unless we stumble into some
truly incredible luck, it’s almost impossible for us to be able to
make Universe treasures submit to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was a good
example. He was an exalted member of the Ancients and was a master in
staff-arts who had studied the legacy of that ancestor Hegemon of the
Ancient race, but the ancestor’s Universe longstaff had refused to
follow him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Universe treasures
possess infinite lifespans, while Daolords only live for 108,000
chaos cycles.” Hegemon Welkin sighed. “If they follow a Daolord
and that Daolord fails the Daomerge, they would have to bear the pain
of eventually parting with him. This is why Universe treasures
generally only choose Eternal Emperors, unless a particular Daolord
is extremely intriguing to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
Ninedust both nodded. Final farewells were indeed painful to make.
The relationships between lifeblood weapons and their masters were
almost familial in nature, and the same was true for the relationship
between Universe treasures and their masters. This was why so many
Universe treasures longed for their original deceased masters despite
the passage of many, many chaos cycles. In fact, they would often
choose to follow new masters based on similarities between their new
master and the old one. They had to have similar personalities,
characteristics, and even Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You two
youngers should train hard. I hope that in the distant future I’ll
be able to meet the two of you again,” Hegemon Welkin said with a
laugh. He then waved his hand, causing that flying vessel to appear
once more. He entered his vessel, then tore through spacetime and
immediately disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
watched as Hegemon Welkin left with mixed feelings. They understood
that the chances of them meeting him again were very, very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon… I
absolute must succeed in my Daomerge and become a Hegemon.”
Ninedust ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Succeed in the
Daomerge!” Ning’s eyes were filled with resolution and desire as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither Ning nor
Ninedust were confident in their chances at the Daomerge. Anyone who
had mastered a fused Supreme Dao would become a Hegemon upon
completing the Daomerge… but alas, this was simply too difficult.
As for Ning? His Omega Sword Dao was far more difficult than even
that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they didn’t
feel confident, they still felt desire and eagerness. The Daomerge
was the ultimate goal for any and every Daolord. But of course, in
Ning’s heart what mattered the most was still reviving his wife Yu
Wei. His cultivation goals and the Daomerge were second to that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there within
the empty darkness. He waved a finger, causing the other five
Northbow swords to fly out from the sheath on his back towards the
great Stone Hellephant Wall in front of him. They joined with the
first Northbow sword to form a circular pattern that was roughly a
thousand kilometers in diameter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Children, do your
best to ‘eat’ your way around this area and dig out
thousand-kilometer spheres of deepfire blackstone,” Ning called out
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, our master is
so clever! He wants us to help him dig out the deepfire blackstone
ore!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The children atop the
six Northbow swords immediately let out excited calls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was standing
next to Ning within the darkness. He said in amazement, “D-Darknorth,
are you planning on…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the Northbow
swords are able to devour the deepfire blackstone, I’m going to use
them to harvest as much of the Stone Hellephant Wall as I can,”
Ning said. “Not even the Hegemon was able to move this massive
thing in its entirety, but if I can segment them into smaller pieces
I might be able to do so. If I can, it’ll be worth a quite a pretty
sum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” Ninedust
revealed a look of delight. “All that deepfire blackstone… wow.
That really would be a fortune! Haha, I think Hegemon Welkin never
would’ve imagined that you could use the Northbow swords to segment
the Stone Hellephant Wall. If he did, he wouldn’t have walked away
like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not as much
as you think.” Ning shook his head. “Deepfire blackstone doesn’t
have that many usages. The reason why it is sold for a fairly high
price in the Dao Alliance is because it is fairly rare; the Endless
Territories only have three thousand meters of it. Even if I do
successfully harvest the entire million-kilometer Stone Hellephant
Wall, who am I supposed to sell so much deepfire blackstone to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When supply was
limited, prices would remain high. When the supply suddenly
skyrocketed, the price would drastically crater. This was even more
the case given how deepfire blackstone wasn’t very useful. If it
was more useful, this wall would’ve been a true fortune! Hegemon
Welkin probably would’ve paid any price necessary to invite other
major powers to help him out and somehow take away the Stone
Hellephant Wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To Hegemons, it
isn’t all that valuable. To us, though, this is still a nice sum,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack, crack, crack.
The six Northbow swords continuously devoured the deepfire blackstone
ore, doing their best to carve out a sphere of ore from the Stone
Hellephant Wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that the six Northbow swords needed to absorb roughly a three hundred
thousand meter mountain of ore, an astonishing amount. For them to
merely carve out a thousand-kilometer globe of deepfire blackstone
meant that they were basically just ‘eating’ a surface portion.
It actually wasn’t much at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mere hour later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, we can’t
harvest any more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
dig any deeper.” The children atop the six Northbow swords all
started to call out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way to dig any
deeper?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t they dig
any deeper?” The nearby Ninedust also said, “Is there something
inside that isn’t deepfire blackstone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t deepfire
blackstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s something
else. We can’t absorb it,” the six children called out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
traded a glance. They both had the feeling that the Stone Hellephant
Wall perhaps held more secrets than they had expected. It must be
remembered that it was over a million kilometers long but just a
thousand kilometers wide, making it very ‘flat’. They had thought
that it was completely composed of deepfire blackstone, but it seemed
as though it held a core of something else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then carve out as
much as you can within the thousand-kilometer radius,” Nin
ginstructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Got it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” All six
children called out in unison, working together to slowly move closer
and closer to each other. A short while later, the children called
out, “We’re finished!” “Master, we’re done carving!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning sent out
his will, using his six Northbow swords to apply a bit of power.
Boom! The large round chunk of deepfire blackstone was actually
knocked free from the rest of the Stone Hellephant Wall. This chunk
of ore was spheroid in shape. It was a thousand kilometers long but
only two hundred kilometers ‘deep’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” Ning
walked forwards and grabbed the large chunk of ore, trying to pull it
into his estate-world. He immediately sensed how incredibly heavy it
was, but he still gave it a try. Boom! The thousand-kilometer chunk
of deepfire blackstone was pulled by Ning into his estate-world in
its entirety.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deepfire blackstone
is a valuable natural material. At my current level of power, I’m
only able to draw in thousand-kilometer chunks,” Ning said with a
laugh. Experts like him were able to gauge their own abilities with a
certain type of foresight. The reason he had instructed the Northbow
swords to carve out thousand-kilometer chunks was precisely because
he could sense that this was a size that would suit him. The entire
Stone Hellephant Wall was a thousand times longer than the chunk he
had just carved out and much thicker, making it easily a million
times more massive. It also had other materials in its core. This was
why not even Hegemons could draw it in through force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, look!”
Ninedust had already flown over, and he immediately called out to
Ning. Ning flew over as well. When he did, he was able to see that
underneath the carved-out pit of deepfire blackstone was some sort of
silvery-white material that was covered with many runes. These
complicated runes seemed to be part of a single, utterly massive
character.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This script… it
seems quite similar in style to the azureflower seal, the Dreamdust
script, and those three characters I saw at Crimsonwave Temple.”
Ning narrowed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, this
Stone Hellephant Wall seems to contain a great secret within it.”
Ninedust was excited as well.

Chapter 9 - Heavenbreaker Stance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the deepfire
blackstone carved away, a strange silvery-white material of unknown
origins was revealed beneath it. The silvery-white material was
completely sealed and seamless, and the countless runes covering it
caused Ji Ning and Ninedust to feel a sense of alarm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No openings at all.”
Ning frowned, sending out his will. Swish! A fog-formed sword sliced
out using the Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop and struck against the
silvery-white material. Clank! The power of this stsrike caused the
entire vast Stone Hellephant Wall to tremble, but it wasn’t able to
leave the slightest mark behind on the silvery-white material. The
Northbow sword launched consecutive attacks against other parts of
the silvery-white material, only to fail each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
break it at all, and there’s no way for the Northbow sword to
absorb it.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stone Hellephant
Wall has an outer layer of deepfire blackstone and an inner core of
silvery-white material… can it be that the core is completely
solid? What in the world was this thing meant for?” Ninedust was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep
digging!” Ning grinned. “I want to see if the silvery-white
object inside the Stone Hellephant Wall really has no openings
whatsoever. Even if we end up being unable to discover its secrets,
the deepfire blackstone ore alone is still worth quite a sum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite calm,
mentally. He embraced good fortune and misfortune alike! When
encountering strange, unknown secrets while adventuring, one could
easily fall into danger if one lost mental balance. Death would soon
follow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
continued to watch from within the endless darkness as the six
Northbow swords continuously devoured more and more of the outer
layer of deepfire blackstone, chopping the Stone Hellephant Wall up
into multiple cubes and spheres that were roughly a thousand
kilometers in length. Each time, they only ‘ate’ a thin
superficial layer of the ore. Only by doing so would they be able to
completely ‘eat’ their way through the entire wall and carve it
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other. Ning collected every single chunk of deepfire
blackstone his swords harvested, causing the outer layer of the Stone
Hellephant Wall to continuously shrink in size and reveal more and
more of the silvery-white core within. As time passed, the Northbow
swords only began to increase the speed at which they ‘ate’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two months passed in
the blink of an eye. By now, half of the Stone Hellephant Wall had
been carved up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank! Yet another
giant chunk of deepfire blackstone was revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look over
there! There’s an entranceway!” Ninedust pointed while exclaiming
in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An entrance?”
Ning’s gaze instantly fell upon the silvery-white core as well.
Previously, the giant silvery-white object had been completely
seamless. Now, however, they saw a wide passageway that was nearly
thirty meters long and sixty meters high! It was completely dark and
rather windy, preventing Ning and Ninedust from seeing what lay
within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually
an entrance?” Ning immediately looked at the opposite end of the
chunk of deepfire blackstone that he had just carved out. The ore
actually had a passageway within it as well, ending in a door. From
the outside, however, there would’ve been no way to see anything at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this is the
way inside,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do,
Darknorth? Should we enter?” Ninedust asked. Even a fool could tell
that the Stone Hellephant Wall had been artificially created;
otherwise, how could it have such a neat and symmetrical entrance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, not even
Hegemons could produce the vast quantity of deepfire blackstone which
made up the outermost layer of the Stone Hellephant Wall. Both of
them could sense that the mysteries hidden within had to be
absolutely terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a massive
feat in engineering. No ordinary Hegemon could’ve created this
wall.” Ning frowned. “Let’s not rush into things. It’s not
going anywhere, and it seems unlikely that anyone else in the Great
Dark will just so happen to stumble upon this place. Let me finish
fully harvesting the deepfire blackstone, then we’ll decide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northbow swords
were devouring the ore faster and faster. After merely another month,
the entire outer layer of deepfire blackstone ore covering the Stone
Hellephant Wall had been completely chopped up into
thousand-kilometer pieces and put away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mining complete.”
Ning revealed a smile. “Children, have you absorbed enough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Northbow swords
flew towards Ning, six children seated open them. “Almost full.”
“Master, I need just a bit more.” “A little more and I’ll be
full.” By now, the Northbow swords had changed yet again in
appearance. They now looked almost black in color, with just a faint
sheen of golden light and blue light covering them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Eat your
fill first. After eating, accompany me inside to take a look.” Ning
looked curiously at the completely harvested Stone Hellephant Wall.
It was now completely silvery-white and covered with countless runes
which formed a single character. Although he had never seen this
character before, he understood that it represented the term
‘Tigerhill’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Stone Hellephant
Wall only had a single entrance, and it had been so well-hidden that
not even Hegemon Welkin had been able to discover it. Ning had only
been able to find it thanks to his swords being able to carve the
deepfire blackstone apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Northbow swords
plunged deep into the final chunk of deepfire blackstone ore,
furiously eating away at it. Just half a day later, they had reached
their utmost limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’m
completely full. I can’t eat another bite.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not able to
eat any more of the deepfire blackstone.” The six Northbow swords
were happily satiated and flew straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grabbed one of the
Northbow swords to inspect it. They were now noticeably heavier than
they had been in the past, and even the pommel was a bit thicker. The
blade, however, was as sharp as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give them a
try.” Ning immediately began to execute the five stances of his
Omega Sword Dao while Ninedust watched enviously off to one side. He
had a lifeblood weapon as well, but it clearly wasn’t developing as
nicely as Ning’s was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning delivered a
chop with a double-handed grip, causing the dark space around him to
completely shatter apart. Even time itself broke apart, rendering
spacetime a completely meaningless concept in the region around him!
This terrifying strike carried a dense mist with it as it struck,
crushing through all things that opposed it. It almost instantly
vaporized everything within ten billion kilometers, including
spacetime itself. This strike was so terrifying that even ten
thousand Daolords facing Ning would perish to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying!”
The Ninedust Sectlord was shocked upon seeing this. “T-t-this
strike… even Winesage and his Universe treasure are merely on par.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!” Ning
revealed a look of delight as he clenched his sword. This strike was
the most powerful attack Ning currently had… the Heavenbreaker
stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that previously, the Northbow swords had only enhanced the Blood Drop
stance to a significant degree, but even then the raw power of the
Blood Drop stance was inferior to that of the Heavenbreaker stance!
The Blood Drop stance specialized in speed and penetrative power,
while the Heavenbreaker stance truly relied on overwhelming might.
Ning had relied on successive strikes from the Heavenbreaker stance
to overwhelm and completely destroy the Kingfreak, literally beating
him to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had infused
his Heavenbreaker stance with the power of the [Heartsword] art and
absorbed a prodigious amount of deepfire blackstone with his Northbow
swords, his Heavenbreaker stance was comparable to his Blood Drop
stance. In raw power, this strike was on the same level as the
strikes of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. This was Ning’s
most dominating, devastating strike to date!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This feeling of
overwhelming, crushing power is absolutely wonderful.” Ning felt
quite delighted. It wouldn’t matter if his foes used intricate
techniques; he would be able to smash through them with dominating
force! This was what Winesage had done and how he had been able to
force all the other Daolords to bow their heads before him. Even Ning
had been beaten to the point where he didn’t dare fight the man
head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, your
lifeblood swords have improved quite a bit after devouring all that
deepfire blackstone,” Ninedust said enviously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning gently
stroked the flat of the sword. “This was of great help to my
Northbow swords… but the [Heartsword] art helped quite a bit as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Heartsword]
art? The sword-art which Emperor Heartsword created?” Ninedust was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually
succeeded in training in the [Heartsword] art? I had no idea. Is that
why your strikes seem to be filled with sword-shaped mist now? I’ve
heard of it long ago, but I’ve never seen it in action myself.”
The Ninedust Sectlord was instantly intrigued by this, as the
[Heartsword] art was incredibly famous. Unfortunately there were
very, very few were able to gain any level of skill in it; thus far,
Ning hadn’t encountered a single Daolord capable of using the
[Heartsword] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder you are so
strong, Darknorth! Ugh, I need to work harder. I can’t let you get
too far ahead of me.” Ninedust was filled with a strong competitive
desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked over,
reaching out to grab what remained of the final piece of deepfire
blackstone and putting it into his estate-world. “Let’s go. Time
to go inside the Stone Hellephant Wall and see what lies within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go
inside.” Ninedust looked at the distant passageway as well, his
eyes blazing with eagerness. “It definitely holds some incredible
secrets within it. Maybe I’ll find a Universe treasure that will
acknowledge me as its master! Haha… I would have my invulnerable
aquaform for defense and a Universe treasure for offense. I’d
probably be even more powerful than you, Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there really are
Universe treasures, make sure I get one as well,” Ning said as he
flew forwards alongside Ninedust. Laughing and smiling, the two moved
closer and closer to the entranceway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After going inside,
their faces slowly turned solemn. Ning manifested three heads and six
arms and held all six Northbow swords at the ready, while the
Ninedust Sectlord advanced carefully with his longstaff in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll scout the
path ahead,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. Ninedust’s invulnerable aquaform was indeed far better at
keeping him alive than what Ning had at present.

Chapter 10 - Tigerhill
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flew forwards
together into the entrance passage. The silvery-white passageway’s
walls were lined with mysterious runes. Ninedust glanced at them and
said, “Those should be barrier formation runes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An invisible field
of energy is protecting the core of the Stone Hellephant Wall,” Ji
Ning said solemnly. “I can sense an invisible, omnipresent form of
pressure. Even my godsense is affected by it and rendered
inoperable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same.” Ninedust
grew even more cautious as well. Both moved forward with great care,
ready to unleash their power at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After following this
passageway for roughly three kilometers, they reached a fork in the
road.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s choose this
one,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. No matter
what, the two of us need to stick together. Don’t give them any
chance to pick us off separately.” Ning’s expression grew
increasingly solemn. When he saw those runes on the walls, he
understood that these barriers definitely possessed incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over there!”
A short while later, Ninedust called out excitedly from a corner up
ahead as he pointed towards something in front of him. Ning hurriedly
charged over, only to see a gaping ‘wound’ in the silvery-white
walls that emanated an aura of terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world?”
Ning and Ninedust both moved closer to inspect it carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ninedust
stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? The entire passageway is formed from this silvery-white
substance. I can’t even scratch it with a full-force blow. Could it
have been completely torn open like this?” Ning stared at the
jagged, gaping wounds in the walls of the passageway up ahead. There
were five of the tears in total, and all of the runes within the
passageway had been completely wrecked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single tear was
over three hundred meters long and more than thirty meters deep,
thoroughly destroying the formations and script which had covered the
passageway walls. In fact, there was some silvery-white debris
littering the walls as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those five tears…
they look like they were made by someone using his hand.” Ninedust
had a look of disbelief on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His hand?” Ning
couldn’t help but say, “Let me try again. Perhaps the
silvery-white substance here is weaker than elsewhere.” As Ning
spoke, he set up a barrier to block out any trembles generated in
this area, then put away five of his Northbow swords. He gripped the
single remaining Northbow sword with all six hands, then struck out
with his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker, sending it directly against
a palm-sized silvery-white fragment on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A boundlessly
savage blast of power smashed out along with his sword against the
silvery-white debris, sending it flying off the ground and smashing
directly into the nearby walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” Ning waved
his hand, catching the ricocheting piece of rubble. “Completely
undamaged?” Ning stared at the slick piece of debris. The only
damage visible was the damage at the very edges, which had been
generated when it had been originally torn off the walls by that
unknown major power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight lords of
the Sacred Cities might be a bit stronger than me, but this is on a
completely different level.” Ning carefully scrutinized the piece
of rubble. “It seems someone who was at least as strong as a
Hegemon caused the damage here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
agreed with this assessment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemons were far more
powerful than them. Their Eternal divine power and their Daos were
all far superior… and they generally had Universe treasures at
their disposal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The runes and
barriers in this tunnel have all been wrecked. Come, let’s keep
searching,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t let the
rubble go to waste. They might be useful.” Ninedust waved his hand,
collecting the bits of silvery-white rubble laying on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to
advance through the passageway. Ning and Ninedust soon saw another
hall that had a strange sacrificial altar within it, but the
terrifying claw-marks appeared atop the altar as well. The entire
altar had been torn asunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They also saw a round,
fiery-red pillar that was also covered with countless runes. Clearly,
these had been part of a powerful and mysterious formation… but
alas, the pillar had also been clawed open as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There clearly was a
battle here,” Ninedust said while walking. “An unknown major
power caused all of this destruction, wrecking many of the formations
here. The person in charge of the Stone Hellephant Wall was
completely unable to fight back… but why is it that we don’t see
any corpses at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look up ahead.”
Ning pointed towards the path up in front of them. A completely empty
void was there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have we reached the
end?” Ning and Ninedust quickly reached the opening, then stared
into the void. The vast void was filled with a faint, light blue mist
that covered an area of over a hundred billion kilometers. At the
very center of this vast void was a dazzling planet that was billions
of kilometers in diameter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, are you
thinking what I’m thinking?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, so you are
thinking about that as well?” Ninedust laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “This style… it should be the Sithe race’s style.”
When they had been in that giant humanoid’s body, they had seen
that it was filled with countless stone passageways as well as vast
planets. Ning had acquired his third disciple in one of those
planets, the young man named ‘Skywind’. That giant humanoid had
been Sithe, and it had slain one Hegemon outright while injuring a
second one so gravely that the second Hegemon, a member of the
Ancient race, had passed away from his wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The creator of the
Stone Hellephant Wall was able to manipulate both deepfire blackstone
as well as this unknown silvery-white material in its creation. This
really does seem like something the Sithe might do,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, the Sithe
greatly surpassed us cultivators in many areas,” Ninedust agreed.
Although the Sithe had been wiped out, their power was undisputable.
It was precisely of how powerful they were that the Autarchs had been
forced to lead all cultivator civilizations to war against them. The
flames of war had filled countless places, causing the Flamedragon
Realmverse to lose all of the Hegemons it had at that time. One could
only imagine how miserable that war had been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how it was
floating through the Great Dark, my guess is that the Stone
Hellephant Wall was left behind from the Dawn War,” Ninedust said.
“It shouldn’t hold too much danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it’s
completely filled with that invisible aura of power… and I have the
feeling that it is even more dangerous than that humanoid creature we
were in,” Ning said. “Although it logically shouldn’t be
dangerous, even the slightest bit of remaining power might be enough
to wipe us both out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
narrowed his eyes. “Screw it. Let’s give it a try. We might just
find a huge treasure trove inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, let’s fly
over.” Ning was the first to fly towards the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures the Sithe
left behind often represented a vast fortune. Crimsonwave Temple was
but a single relic, but it was more valuable than the combined
networths of all three Hegemons of the Flamedragon Realmverse!
Perhaps the Stone Hellephant Wall had something inside that was
comparable to Crimsonwave Temple in value. How could Ning possibly
shrink back from it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There might be
living beings inside this planet,” Ninedust said while flying next
to Ning. “Last time we entered the homeland of your disciple,
Skywind, we were almost immediately discovered by those locals.
Should we perhaps mask our auras this time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes we should.
Let us pretend to be Daolords of the Second Step,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
agreed with this idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change.” “Change.”
Ninedust and Ning immediately changed their auras through the
[Vitalis] art. This was the most formidable masking technique they
knew, capable of changing even their truesoul’s aura. Ning was
simulating the aura which Daolord Pillsaint had back when he was a
Daolord of the Second Step, while Ninedust did the same for a
different Daolord he knew. The simulation was only effective when
used to emulate you actually knew. After masking their auras, the two
quickly reached the region outside the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That invisible aura
of power is growing stronger.” Ning and Ninedust exchanged a
glance. Swoosh. Swoosh. The two carefully flew towards the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The planet was
surrounded by a thick layer of clouds and mist. They flew through the
multiple layers of clouds, slowly beginning to see the world beneath
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a vast world
filled with many mountains, and it was teeming with countless living
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s life here.
They look humanoid.” Ning’s vision was frighteningly sharp,
allowing him to see them with clarity. “Judging from their auras,
the living beings here are all quite strong. There are many Empyrean
Gods and Celestial Immortals, and I can even see Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! They could sense
faint, violent ripples of power emanating from off in the distance.
“There’s a fight over there.” Ninedust stared towards the
direction of the battle. “Let’s go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
flew over. From their midair position, they were quickly able to see
the great battle which was occurring off in the distance. The forces
of both sides were fighting furiously against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All World-level
cultivators,” Ninedust said casually. To them, World-level
cultivators truly were nothing more than ants. “Nearly sixty of
them battling, divided up into two sides.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone capable of
commanding so many World-level cultivators should be fairly strong,”
Ninedust said. “We should be able to learn quite a bit regarding
this planet from them, and thus more quickly divine the mysteries of
this Stone Hellephant Wall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
nodded. Both of them remained extremely cautious; just a fraction of
the power originally held within the relic sites left behind by the
Sithe was enough to claim their lives. How could they NOT be careful?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
immediately flew towards the group of battling World-level
cultivators.

Chapter 11 - Tianello
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Ninedust
flew quickly towards the mist to the battlefield. Meanwhile, the
battle between the World-level cultivators was reaching a fever
pitch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Saber-light
chopped through a World God’s body, slicing him in half. A
heartbeat later, his body was ground into dust. The white-robed
machete-wielding man then charged towards another World-level
cultivator, a hate-filled look on his face. He was clearly the most
powerful person on the battlefield. He was extremely fast and his
saber-arts were exceptionally brutal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maji!” The other
World-level cultivator was clearly in dire straits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maji, stop this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maji, you despicable
lowlife. How dare you assault us members of the Tianello clan!” the
other World-level cultivators bellowed furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You refused to give
my clan a way out, so I’m not giving you a way out either! Kill
them, my clansmen! Wipe them all out! If a single one of them
escapes, we’ll be in big trouble. If we can wipe them out, we can
relocate our tribe and join one of the Tianello clan’s enemies!”
Maji had a savage look on his face as he bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill these Tianello
clansmen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe’m out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the total
combat power of the Tianello clansmen was higher overall, the one
named Maji was simply too powerful as an individual. Thus far, he had
already killed a total of twelve World-level cultivators by himself
in this clash! He had been able to force the warriors of the Tianello
clan to the brink of withdrawal, with only their fear of the strict
laws of the clan holding them back from a complete retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had come on the
orders of the Tianello clan to take away a treasure this minor clan
had acquired, a certain bugbeast core component. They were so
accustomed to behaving in a domineering fashion that they had been
planning to massacre the minor clan and then offer the treasure to
the high-level members of the clan. As for the other treasures the
minor clan had owned? They were going to split them internally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had first set up a
formation, planning to trap and massacre everyone. They never
would’ve imagined that this weak clan’s leader, Maji, was so
incredibly powerful that he had been able to burst the formation
apart, then lead his clan’s World-level cultivators to fight their
way out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually dare
to kill the members of the Tianello clan! Let’s leave and report
this to the clan immediately! We’ll have the clan send out the
entire army to wipe them out and leave none of them behind.” By
now, the Tianello clansmen had been shaken by Maji’s assaults. In
the end, they chose to retreat. Although they would be punished upon
their return for failing in their mission, at least they wouldn’t
lose their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
World-level cultivators all began to flee frantically. But just as
they began to do so, a calm voice rang out. “Don’t be in a such
to run.” The fleeing World-level cultivators all felt their bodies
turn soft. Their movements began to dramatically slow down before
coming to a complete halt… and then they began to slowly fly
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
two figures descended from the skies. One was a silver-robed man, the
other was a white-robed youth who bore a sword sheath on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord!” The
World-level cultivators led by Maji all turned pale. The difference
in power between World-level cultivators and Daolords was
insurmountable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Tianello clan,
eh? They seem to be pretty powerful.” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s start
with them,” Ninedust offered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning’s
heartforce had already completely pervaded the souls and truesouls of
the Tianello clan’s World-level cultivators, allowing him to easily
rifle through their souls. Ning’s heartforce was now so powerful
that he was ranked number one amongst Daolords in the Endless
Territories; manipulating World-level cultivators was simplicity
itself for him. Soon, Ning had completely reviewed the memories of
these cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did you find?”
Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This planet is quite
interesting.” Ning smirked. As he chatted with Ninedust he made
sure to block out the sound of their voices, ensuring that no one
aside from the two of them could hear anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting?”
Ninedust was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “This
planet is quite extraordinary. It’s far more powerful than that
other planet we visited, Skywind’s homeland! The cultivators here
are all divided up into clans, with blood lineages determining their
statuses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These clans are
divided into the great clans, standard clans, and lesser clans.
Lesser clans are the weakest, with standard clans generally having a
Daolord and several golems standing guard. As for the great clans,
they each have at least one ‘royal golem’ protecting them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supposedly, this
planet has nine great clans, twenty-one standard clans, and countless
lesser clans,” Ning explained. This was what he had learned through
rifling the memories of the World-level cultivators. “Different
clans can vary immensely in power. A great clan can easily wipe out
one of the standard clans with a fraction of their full power, while
standard clans can do the same to lesser clans. The lesser clans are
viewed as of a lower caste, almost subhuman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was startled.
“So just how many Daolords live on this planet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than thirty at
the very least,” Ning said. “Possibly sixty, possibly eighty…
these World-level cultivators have no clue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ninedust was
surprised. A single planet was capable of giving birth to dozens of
Daolords in each given generation? This was a frightening concept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Tianello clan is
a standard clan and it has a single Daolord protecting it,” Ning
said. “So let us start from them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can die now.”
Ning swept his gaze towards the dull-eyed World-level cultivators.
Instantly, their eyes turned completely lifeless as they fell to the
ground. He left just a single World-level cultivator alive, allowing
the man ‘Tonkee’ to regain his clarity of mind as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?
What’s going on?” Tonkee stared at the surrounding area in panic.
How did all of the others all suddenly die?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go back and tell
Tianello,” Ning barked, “That I, Darknorth, killed these World
Gods! Now beat it!” When Ning had rifled through their memories, he
had learned that they were all Tianello’s lackeys and were so evil
as to wipe out lesser clans for greed alone. Tonkee was slightly
better, morally speaking, than the rest. Still, the only reason why
Ning spared him was because he needed someone to send a message for
him; otherwise, he would’ve killed Tonkee as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you killed them?”
Tonkee stared at Ning in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I said… beat it.”
Ning released a hint of his killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The terrified
Tonkee immediately fled far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maji and his clansmen
stared in shock as they watched this happened, completely stunned by
Ning and Ninedust’s power. What stunned them even more was what
Ning had just said: “Go back and tell Tianello that I, Darknorth,
killed these World Gods! Now beat it!” This clearly was a direct
challenge to Tianello!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tianello was the name
of the Tianello clan’s leader, and he was on extremely good terms
with the nine great clans. He was one of the high-level members of
this world. He wasn’t an easy person to deal with!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior” Maji said,
forcing down his fear and nervousness. Looks of panic were on the
faces of all the World-level cultivators behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, are you scared
now?” A hint of a smile was on Ning’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maji hurriedly said,
“For us to fight back against them when they tried to kill us was a
minor matter; the exalted Tianello would never deign to act against
minor figures like us, giving us a chance to survive if we joined an
enemy of the Tianello clan. But by doing this, seniors… you’ve
just completely insulted him! He’s not going to rest until he
resolves this matter, and his rage will be directed towards us as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">People lived for their
reputations. There were only a few dozen Daolords on this planet,
making them exalted figures. How could Tianello possibly just accept
Ning brazenly slapping him in the face like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you trying to
say that we caused trouble for you?” Ninedust glared at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…” Maji
began to sweat heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!” Ning
started to laugh. “Ninedust, stop scaring these kids.” Indeed,
Maji and the other World-level cultivators all felt rather uneasy
now. “Just keep watching,” Ning instructed. “I’ll guarantee
your safety.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maji and the others
felt resigned. “I guess that’s that.” If they followed these
two powerful Daolords, they might stand a chance at staying alive…
but once they were on their own, it would be far too easy for
Tianello to eradicate them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just one hour later, a
giant vessel appeared in the skies. A white-haired old man stood at
the prow of the vessel, staring towards their direction. He had a
group of subordinates behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tianello has
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Tianello.”
Maji and the others felt nervous and cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
raised their heads to glance at the vessel. Ninedust grinned at Ning:
“He’s a mere Daolord of the Third Step, but he seems pretty full
of himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand vessel slowly
flew through the skies towards them. The white-robed elder stood at
the prow of the ship, staring down at them. When he saw that Ning and
Ninedust merely had auras of Daolords of the Second Step, he relaxed
slightly. He barked out coldly, “You dared to wipe out Tianello
clansmen and then insulted me? It seems that it has been far too long
since I, Tianello, have displayed my pow-.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So shut up and do it
already,” Ninedust said from below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Tianello was
further incensed by this interruption, and cold light flickered in
his eyes. “If that is what you wish… then I will send you off to
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A giant bird
that was at least three thousand meters long suddenly appeared in
front of Tianello. This bird was covered in azure feathers and had a
fiery red tail, as well as an awe-inspiring aura. It was actually
just as powerful as Tianello, and it immediately swooped downwards.

Chapter 12 - Sithe?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maji and the other
World-level cultivators behind Ji Ning and Ninedust had started to
panic long ago. If you have to hit someone, you aren’t supposed to
slap them in the face! Not even Daolords would brazenly provoke other
Daolords for no good reason. Ning’s provocative actions were
designed to force Tianello out. If he hid back despite all of this,
he would probably become the laughingstock of this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that’s rather
interesting.” Ninedust waved his right hand, causing it to
dramatically expand in size. It blocked out the skies and the sun as
it clawed out towards the avian. The avian let out a furious screech
as it tore at Ninedust’s hand with its clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! As an Ancient
cultivator, Ninedust had an incredibly powerful divine body. Given
that he was now a supreme Daolord, even a casual swipe from him was
far beyond the likes of a golem which was merely equivalent to a
Daolord of the Third Step. His giant fingers closed in around the
avian, which sought to struggle but was completely unable to break
free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Tianello
was shocked when he saw this from his position aboard his ship. His
golem was equivalent to him in power, but it had been captured by a
casual swipe?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s absolutely
terrifying. They’re definitely not people that I can fight back
against. I need to run.” Tianello immediately fled, not worrying
about anything else at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing on
the ground, head raised and watching this with a smile. “Come on
down.” An invisible surge of power instantly swept out to cover the
entire vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the cultivators
on the vessel, Tianello included, were instantly trapped within an
illusory world. The entire vessel began to descend from the skies and
landed on the ground. One figure after another began to walk out of
the vessel, their eyes blank. The leader of the group was the
white-haired elder Tianello, whose gaze was equally vacant. He wasn’t
able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-this…” Maji
and the other World-level cultivators stared at this in astonishment.
The mighty Tianello had been mentally dominated before even having a
chance to fight in close combat? This was inconceivable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tianello,” Ning
called out. “I ask you this: who are the most powerful people
within this world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top three clans
of the nine great clans are the Fumo clan, the Juwah clan, and the
Nonti clan. These three great clans are far more powerful than the
other six great clans.” Tianello’s gaze was vacant as he
continued, “The Fumo clan, the Juwah clan, and the Nonti clan are
incredibly powerful. Any of them could wipe out the other six great
clans with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They call themselves
members of the ‘Sithe’ race. All other clans have to submit to
them, and they are the true rulers of this world,” Tianello said
numbly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
turned pale when they heard this. What?! The three most powerful
clans in this planet actually referred to themselves as ‘Sithe’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They call themselves
‘Sithe’? Why?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t know. They
are the most ancient and most powerful clans on this planet. No one
can resist them,” Tianello said. “Those who try to do so all
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth… is it
possible that a few scattered members of the Sithe actually
survived?” Ninedust said. Both he and Darknorth suspected that the
Stone Hellephant Wall had been created by the Sithe! It wasn’t
impossible that some Sithe survived to live on this planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entirely possible.”
Ning was much more somber now as well. “If it really is the Sithe…
we’re in a great deal of danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do the three great
clans have any Eternal Emperors? Does this world hold any Eternal
Emperors?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.” Tianello
replied robotically, “It has been a long, long time since any
Emperors have appeared within this world. The annals of history do
contain records of an Eternal Emperor who launched a grand war
against the three great clans, but they joined forces and managed to
kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They killed an
Eternal Emperor?” Ning frowned. “Was that Emperor an ordinary
Daolord who broke through, or was he an incredibly powerful one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was an ordinary
Daolord who broke through,” Tianello replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and Ninedust
let out sighs of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we hit’m?”
Ninedust looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Ning
nodded. “If they title themselves ‘Sithe’, then they are actual
Sithe survivors or inheritors of the Sithe legacy. No matter what,
they definitely know some of the secrets of the Sithe! If all three
great clans had to work together to deal with an ordinary Daolord who
broke through to become an Eternal Emperor, they shouldn’t be all
that powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least they don’t
have any Eternal Emperors at present.” Ninedust nodded as well. If
they didn’t have any Eternal Emperors, it didn’t mater if they
had access to Sithe technology and techniques. Ning and Ninedust were
both supreme Daolords! They were both capable of slaying ordinary
Eternal Emperors, especially Ning; Ning was now close to being on the
same level as the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. Perhaps he was
still rather lacking when compared to them, but he would be able to
utterly dominate any Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and Ninedust
discussed this secretive matters, they didn’t let Maji or the
others overheard them. Maji and his World-level companions only
watched as Tianello stared blankly as he spoke words they couldn’t
hear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Awaken,” Ning
commanded softly. Tianello immediately came back to his senses, as
did the subordinates behind him. When he did so, he instantly felt
terrified. He could clearly remember what he had just told Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-you…”
Tianello couldn’t believe it. There was actually a person in this
world capable of controlling him and forcing him to reveal some of
his secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Self-claimed Sithe…
interesting.” Ning looked at Ninedust. “Let’s do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You first,”
Ninedust grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a limit to
how strong the three great clans were. They didn’t even have a
single Emperor! They did, however, claim themselves to be the
‘Sithe’, which meant they definitely were in command of certain
Sithe mysteries. Given that it shouldn’t be all that dangerous, how
could Ning and Ninedust just leave?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld,
descend!” Ning immediately unleashed his heartworld projection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast heartworld
projection came crashing down, filling every single inch of this
entire planet. The powerful sense of pressure brought terror to all
of the countless living beings in the planet… but of course, Ning
didn’t use it to attack any of those weaklings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I feel as
though an illusory world just fell upon us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless living
creatures all raised their heads to stare upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This must be a
Heartforce Cultivator’s heartworld projection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a long
time since a Heartworld Cultivator has appeared in our planet. Has a
new one arisen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This heartworld
projection is far too powerful. Even I feel a sense of fear! If it
releases just a bit of its power, it could kill the two of us with
ease.” A male and female pair of Daolords raised their heads to
stare into the skies, a look of shock on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dares to act
with such arrogance, using a heartworld projection to suppress my
Nonti clan!” A furious roar rang out from a beautiful golden
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone on this entire
planet, from the three great clans to the countless ordinary living
creatures, all raised their heads to watch as the awesome heartworld
projection descended. A short while later, the image of a white-robed
youth who had a sword on his back appeared within the heartworld
projection. He was absolutely towering in size, and he stared down
upon the great earth, his gaze seeming to fill every inch of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that the Fumo
clan, the Juwah clan, and the Nonti clan are the three most powerful
great clans of this world and have unified it under their rule! But…
no matter how hard I try, I can’t discern anything particularly
impressive about these three great clans. I was planning to wipe them
out, but their Daolords are so weak that I can’t even be bothered
to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen closely. I
can’t be bothered to wipe your three clans out, but from this day
forth you should obediently listen to my commands. If you do so, I’ll
let you live. Otherwise… hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impudence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s courting
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did this fool
even come from?” Three enraged roars rang out from the three great
clans, shaking the entire planet. The leaders of the Fumo, Juwah, and
Nonti clans had been thoroughly enraged. They had ruled this planet
for countless years. No one dared to challenge them… but this
mysterious Heartforce Cultivator was being far too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you seem
rather bold. I, Darknorth, shall be waiting for you at the Cranesoar
Mountains. If you insist on coming to your deaths, feel free to come
find me here.” The illusory white-robed youth within the heartworld
projection peered downwards at the three great clans. “But I really
suggest that you not come. You’d simply be throwing your lives away
if you did… because all of you really are quite weak. Aha, ahaha,
ahahahahaha!” Ning’s laughter echoed throughout every inch of
this planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wilderness at the
base of the Cranesoar Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maji and the other
World-level cultivators stared at Ning and Ninedust, completedly
dazed. Tianello and the World-level cultivators behind him were dazed
as well. All of them had seen that heartworld projection and had
heard Ning’s provocations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s… actually
challenging the three great clans?” Tianello’s voice was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-who in the world
are they?” Maji and the others were petrified as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust,
however, remained quite calm. “All done.” Ning nodded at
Ninedust. “Given the status these three great clans hold, there’s
no way they’d just take that lying down. They’ll definitely
attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
concurred. “That way, this battle is at a time and place of our
choosing. That’s of benefit to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that these three
great clans called themselves the Sithe, Ning and Ninedust were
concerned that their headquarters probably wouldn’t be easily
destroyed. Thus, they would choose a different place for the battle!
Ning’s deliberate provocations were aimed at forcing his enemies to
come to the Cranesoar Mountains, as there were no dangerous
formations here to worry about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
talking tough, he wasn’t so foolish as to actually charge straight
into the headquarters of the three great clans.

Chapter 13 - Emperor Golems
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The challenge having
been issued, Ji Ning and Ninedust entered the Cranesoar Mountains and
awaited the arrival of the three great clans. In truth, Ning was
right to be cautious. This planet held many mysteries within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
planet’s core. There was a bubbling lake of lava here, and there
were three figures seated next to it. These three figures all had
silver skin, and the auras they emanated were different from the
auras of normal cultivators. They were quite bizarre and inscrutable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them, a
particularly muscular silver man, let out a growl: “He actually
dares to challenge all three of our clans simultaneously. My fellow
clan leaders of the Juwah clan and Nonti clan, have either of you
heard of this ‘Darknorth’ before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Never heard of him.”
“I have no idea where he came from.” the two other silver men
responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ‘Darknorth’
is extremely arrogant, and his heartworld projection is incredibly
powerful. In heartforce, at least, he’s reached the utter apex.”
The muscular silver man said, “I find it very likely that he’s a
supreme Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A supreme Daolord?
Haha, after so many years, this planet of ours has finally given
birth to yet another supreme Daolord,” the skinnier silver man
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The birth of every
supreme Daolord is rather diverting to our three clans,” the long
silver-haired man said. “To our three clans, there is nothing in
this planet that can pose a threat to us. That makes life rather
boring. The other six clans are only ‘great clans’ because they
have some small portion of our bloodlines and lineage, and so we’ve
bestowed the title of ‘great clan’ upon them. If it wasn’t for
that… hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can those other
lowly clans compare with us, the exalted Sithe?” The muscular
silver man said coldly, “Since this supreme Daolord has chosen to
challenge us and is an extremely strong Heartforce Cultivator… how
do the two of you think we should response?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go personally
kill him,” the skinny silver man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of us have
undergone the ‘Ritual Sacrificium’, making us the only true Sithe
in this entire planet.” The silver-haired, silver-skinned man shook
his head. “For noble Sithe like us to lower ourselves to fight
against these lowly races is demeaning. Sending golems is enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also feel that
sending golems should suffice. My recommendation is that each of our
three clans should send out two Emperor-class golems. What do you
think?” the muscular silver man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sending two
Emperor-class golems is more than enough.” The other two silver men
agreed with this proposal. Their clans possessed exalted power. Even
a tiny fraction of their full might was enough to completely dominate
this entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of
countless years, their world had actually given birth to an Eternal
Emperor. However, that Eternal Emperor had been extremely weak. In
comparison, there had been far more supreme Daolords in the history
of this world. There was usually at least one in every generation!
Some of them dared to try and challenge the status of the three great
clans… and all of them died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody could resist
them! They were the true, indisputable, unshakeable rulers of this
planet. They always had been and they always would be! In truth, the
power they had revealed to wipe out those upstart challengers had
always been nothing more than a fraction of their full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dark room in
the Fumo clan. There were six pitch-black figures seated with their
eyes shut, completely unmoving. Suddenly, two of the pitch-black
figures opened their eyes. Their eyes gleamed with green, crystalline
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” both
golems called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a
Heartforce Cultivator known as Darknorth. He seems to be a supreme
Daolord, and he’s chosen to challenge the Sithe. The two of you
shall head to the Cranesoar Mountains and kill him.” The muscular
silver man’s voice boomed out, echoing throughout the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” both
figures said respectfully. The other four pitch-black figures opened
their eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us are
going to go out and have some first, brothers. Hahaha…” The two
golems laughed quite smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and kill
this Daolord Darknorth, then come back and tell us all about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, I’m bored
senseless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that Master
has only sent the two of you.” The other four golems spoke out as
well. As golems, they possessed eternal lifespans. This world wasn’t
all that large; they knew every inch of it by now! This was why they
normally preferred to spend their time in slumber. Only when the clan
encountered some fairly troublesome opponents like ‘supreme
Daolords’ would they be sent out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Emperor-class
golems immediately left the room and soared into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Cranesoar
Mountains. Tianello, Maji, and the others all watched nervously. Ning
and Ninedust, however, simply waited patiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened slightly as he stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ninedust was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three clans have
sent their troops out towards the Cranesoar Mountains.” Puzzled,
Ning continued, “But… they each only sent a pair of golems. All
combined, there are six of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six golems against
the two of us?” Ninedust was puzzled as well. “Darknorth, the
heartworld projection you revealed should’ve alerted them that you
are probably at the supreme Daolord level. Why have they only sent
six golems? Based on what I know, most golems are merely comparable
to fourth-step Daolords at best.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There ARE some
golems that are stronger than the Daolord level,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” Ninedust
nodded. The major powers of the Endless Territories were only able to
create golems comparable to Daolords of the Fourth Step at best.
However… some particularly dangerous regions sometimes held golems
that had been left behind since the Dawn War which surpassed this
level. Ning had personally seen those two mighty golems which stood
guard over the palace of the Brightshore Imperials. One looked like a
humanoid statue while the other was a bestial statue, but both were
actually golems which held the power of Eternal Emperors. No one knew
where the Brightshore Hegemon had found them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are talking
about Emperor-class golems,” Ninedust said. “We Ancient
cultivators have some, but they were passed down to us from many,
many years ago. The Endless Territories have very few Emperor-class
golems, and the number we Ancient cultivators have can be counted on
one hand. Are you telling me that all six golems attacking us are
Emperor-class? Since when did they become as common as the grass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I find it hard to
believe as well,” Ning said with a sigh. Emperor-class golems…
they could only be found in truly dangerous zones such as the
battlefield of the Dawn War. They were incredibly rare… but now,
six had appeared at the same time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if they aren’t
Emperor-class, how would the three great clans dare to send just six
of them against us?” Ning shook his head. “They should know that
I have the power of a supreme Daolord; sending Daolord-class golems
against me is tantamount to just gifting me with treasures. Thus…
although I still find it hard to believe, it does seem as though
these should be Emperor-class golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six Emperor-class
golems.” Ninedust revealed a wary look. “Can we handle them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There should be
differences in power amongst Emperor-class golems; some are strong,
some are weak. We should be able to handle them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The creation of every
Emperor-class golem was extremely difficult. The Endless Territories
weren’t even able to make them, with only fourth-step Daolord
golems being forgeable! Thus, every single Emperor-class golem had
their own unique traits. They all had invulnerable bodies, and in
accordance with the wishes of their makers they often knew certain
ultimate attacks as well! Even Ning felt nervous at the thought of
fighting six at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was still
‘merely’ at the supreme Daolord level, he would probably be even
more nervous. However, the Northbow swords and the [Heartsword] art
put Ning close to the level of the lords of the eight Sacred Cities.
Thus, he still felt fairly good in his chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
with them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two…
something seems off with them.” Tianello, Maji, and the others all
noticed the somber looks appear on the faces of Ning and Ninedust,
who had appeared quite relaxed just a short while ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tianello shook his head
and sighed, “None of the three great clans are easy to deal with.
Ever since the earliest annals of recorded history, the three great
clans have always jointly ruled over our planet together. No one has
ever been able to threaten them. Ugh. These two Daolords might be
very powerful, but they were too over-confident. They are courting
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
couldn’t even be bothered to talk to the cultivators behind them.
They simply stared into the skies, somber looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six distant golems
soared through the skies, emanating auras of incredible power as they
flew towards Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This level of
power…” Ninedust murmured softly, “The aura emanating from them
as they are flying is already far beyond what Daolords of the Fourth
Step are capable of. They are definitely Emperor-class. Darknorth,
this is going to be seriously troublesome. I didn’t expect the
three great clans to be this strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor-class golems
were far more difficult to deal with than ordinary Eternal Emperors.
They were virtually indestructible! Ning had only trained his body to
make it comparable to a middle-grade Eternal treasure, but
Emperor-class golems were all top-grade Eternal treasures. The
techniques they used were based on the designs of their makers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the three
great clans are connected to the Sithe and even call themselves the
Sithe, it’s not that surprising that they have a few tricks up
their sleeves.” Ning’s eyes radiated an eagerness to do battle.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move a bit farther
away,” Ji Ning suddenly said, his voice ringing out by the ears of
Tinello, Maji, and the other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” The
cultivators were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s telling you
to run the hell away.” Ninedust turned to stare at them. “Once
the battle starts, even the smallest of shockwaves will be enough to
claim your lives. We certainly won’t be able to pay attention to
you and keep you safe.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quickly.”
Tianello, Maji, and the others immediately reacted, transforming into
streaks of light that flew far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
watching as the six figures flew towards them at high speeds. He
manifested three heads and six arms, then drew all six Northbow
swords. “Here they come. Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m also curious
as to just how tough Emperor-class golems are.” Ninedust had his
longstaff at the ready and was also watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six golems in
midair all came to a halt. They hung in the air, staring downwards as
if they were looking at ants. As Emperor-class golems who had been
working for the three great clans since the clans had been
established, they had killed many supreme Daolords over the course of
countless years. Thus, they were completely confident in their
chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which one of you is
Daolord Darknorth?” The swordsman golem stared downwards. Of the
six golems, this one was the only one wielding a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dared
to challenge the three great clans. Poor kid… do you have any clue
as to how powerful they truly are? You really didn’t know your own
limits.” The swordsman golem stared at Ning in a rather sympathetic
way, then glanced at Ninedust. “And this Daolord next to you. Is he
with you? If he leaves immediately, we can spare him. Otherwise,
we’ll have to wipe him out as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back on the ground,
Ninedust and Ning exchanged a glance, then smiled. Ninedust said with
a cold laugh, “You want to kill me? Give me your best shot and show
me what you have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to give you
a way out of this. Oh well. If this is what you choose…” The
swordsman golem sighed and shook his head, then said in a cold voice,
“Let’s kill them, brothers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me go first!”
The six golems moved in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, let out
a cold snort. Boom! The heartworld projection that had been covering
this entire planet instantly shrank down to merely cover an area of a
million kilometers, causing its power to skyrocket! It pressed down
upon the six golems, causing all of them to feel their bodies
stiffen. At the same time, Ning allowed nine energy dragons to fly
out of his body, forming into the Yin-Yang Sword Domain and sending
the pressure of the domain out towards the golems as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
binding spell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I feel this
heavy?” Upon being suppressed by the heartworld projection and the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain at the same time, the six golems were just
barely able to stay afloat. They felt as though trillions of
mountains had just come crashing down upon them, weighing them down
immensely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Emperor-class
golems had been around for an extremely long period of time and had
encountered both supreme Daolords and Heartforce Cultivators.
However, the local ‘supreme Daolords’ had always been limited to
this fairly small region; there was simply no way for them to find
the materials necessary to create truly powerful secret arts! Thus,
Ning’s combination of his nine novessence arts and his heartworld
projection constituted the most powerful bindings which the
Emperor-class golems had ever encountered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavy.” The six
golems exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!” one of
the golems bellowed, leading the way with a charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! A streak of
golden lightning lashed out through the skies, instantly appearing
before Ning. Ning was quite surprised as well; this attack was
incredibly fast! The speed of this golden lightning had completely
surpassed the ‘normal’ limit of a hundred times the speed of
light, almost instantly appearing right in front of Ning. Within the
streak of golden lightning, a sharp saber could be seen chopping
straight towards Ning with incomparable speed and savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat it.” Ning
didn’t back off in the slightest. A streak of mist-formed sword
energy clashed against the saber. Boom! The golden lightning was
knocked flying backwards, reforming into a humanoid shape off in the
distance. The creature was dressed in golden armor and had jade green
eyes; it was the ‘lightning golem’ of the six golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at the lightning golden. Judging from the clash, the lightning golem
was roughly on par with ordinary supreme Daolords; its main strength
came from its speed. Ning’s own sword-arts were also incredibly
fast, allowing him to crush this golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join forces to kill
him!” The other golems began to strike as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An awesome flood
of flames manifested, then condensed into a flaming serpent that
slithered towards Ning. It suddenly opened its mouth as if about to
hiss, sending a black whip coiling straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A flame golem?”
Ning used his Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop yet again. His sword was
fast enough that defeating enemy techniques was fairly easy, unless
the attacks contained a ridiculous amount of power. It was clear that
the whip-strike from the flame golem was merely on par with that of a
supreme Daolord, and so Ning’s mist-formed sword energy was able to
easily disperse it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the
lightning golem and the flame golem, there was also a strange mist
golem that was able to block detection via heartforce or godsense.
Fortunately, Ning’s heartworld projection and nine novessence arts
were not affected. The supreme Daolords of this world rarely had
powerful secret arts or heartworld projections, and so once the mist
surrounded them they wouldn’t be able to see what was happening
around them. As a result, they would be easily defeated and slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also an
extremely deadly eight-armed knife golem. The knife golem had eight
arms, and each of its arms was like a deadly knife. It was fast and
furious in battle, and each knife-arm struck in an extremely
unpredictable manner. When all eight knives struck together, even
Ninedust wasn’t able to overcome the attacks in a head-on fight.
However, Ning was a sword cultivator who was incredibly skilled in
close combat, allowing him to easily defeat the eight-armed knife
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also a
barbarous and dominating golem whose skin was like stone. This stone
golem was massive in size and had six arms, with each arm sculpted
like a statue. It possessed incredible strength and powerful defenses
and was able to take on Ning’s Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop without
being forced back. Its six arms smashed out like giant maces, and it
was the physically strongest golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning was able to
use the Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker. Now that his Northbow swords
had absorbed so much of that deepfire blackstone, the power of this
stance had skyrocketed to a shocking new level, allowing him to
defeat the stone golem head-on as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final golem was the
leader of the group, the swordsman golem. The swordsman golem
transformed into part of an enormous sword when using its sword-arts.
The sword pierced through the skies with absolutely terrifying power,
and it was the most dangerous attack Ning had to face. Despite all
that, it was still staved off by Ning’s Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
between the two sides was quite apparent. The six golems each had
their own special abilities and were all comparable to supreme
Daolords; if they were to work together against the likes of the
Radiant King or Daolord Dreamlore, they would’ve won with ease. But
against Ning? Clearly, they weren’t enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the above
battle took time to describe, the attacks from the six golems and
Ning’s counters all happened almost instantaneously. Ning matched
each of them blow for blow and defeated them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
much stronger than any other supreme Daolord we have ever
encountered. Brothers, attack simultaneously to defeat him!” the
swordsman golem shouted mentally to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join forces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same as always.”
These Emperor-class golems were quite familiar with each other, and
they had a joint attack they used. They almost instantly began to
move in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
A dazzling streak of golden light, a flaming serpent, and a ribbon of
mist coiled around each other, forming a tri-colored rope that then
swirled towards Ning. As for Ninedust, he transformed into a vast sea
of water which the golems were completely unable to do anything to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
did have some techniques they were able to use against supreme
Daolords who had invulnerable forms, but these six Emperor-class
golems didn’t view Ninedust as being that much of a threat. The
real threat was Darknorth, and he was their principal opponent in
this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Ning
immediately could sense how troublesome this tri-colored rope was. He
used his sword-arts to cut through the rope, but the flames,
lightning, and mist joined together once more to reform the rope.
Ning’s strikes didn’t have any effect on the terrifying binding
power of the tri-colored ropes at all. Ning had no choice but to
amplify the effects of his novessence arts and his heartworld
projection upon the tri-colored ropes, but he was still only able to
partially weaken their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This thing really is
quite difficult to deal with.” Ning had been completely surrounded
by the lightning, mist, and flame-forged rope. Because these things
were noncorporeal, Ning was still able to move about and fight, but
his combat power had clearly been affected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the ropes had been
corporeal, this would’ve been much easier. Ning’s sword-arts
would’ve sent the ropes flying long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Catch him, Stone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give’m a big hug.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make it so that he
can’t fight back!” the other golems called out as the six-armed
stone golem came bounding straight towards Ning. Its six arms grew
incredibly thick and long as it reached out, seeking to grab Ning!
Ning knew just how strong this stone golem was; it had been able to
endure Ning’s Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop without even having to
stagger backwards at all. If it really did manage to grapple Ning,
Ning wouldn’t be able to break free at all.
</P>

Chapter 15 - Captured
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tri-colored ropes
coiled around Ji Ning, affecting and encumbering all of his
movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did this in the
past to others. Now, the same is happening to me. I can at most
unleash 70% of my full power.” Ning was secretly stunned. This was
despite the fact that the fire, lightning, and mist were being
weakened by his heartworld projection and nine novessence arts. If it
hadn’t been for the latter two, he would probably be weakened even
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat it!” When
Ning saw the stone golem bound towards him and seek to grapple him,
he immediately used his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker. BOOM! The
stone golem was sent flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Even when we
bind him, he’s still able to send Stone flying?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
powerful?” The other Emperor-class golems were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stone, try again.
You have to be able to grab him. We’ll help you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can grapple
him, he’ll be dead for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I will try
again.” The stone golem once more bounded forwards. This time, the
swordsman golem also transformed into a single sword that hovered
above the eight-armed knife golem. The eight-armed knife golem
charged towards Ning as well, with the sword ready to strike at any
moment. As for the stone golem, it also charged forwards at the same
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Need my help,
Darknorth?” The Ninedust Sectlord was still in his oceanic form,
but he wasn’t in a hurry to intervene just yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need,” Ning
sent back. “I’ll feign weakness for now. Wait for a critical
moment before intervening.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Ninedust
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tri-colored rope
coiled towards Ning as the swordsman golem, the eight-armed golem,
and the stone golem attacked simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce light flashed
through Ning’s eyes. “This is the right moment.” Swoosh! Ning
flew straight towards the eight-armed knife golem and the swordsman
golem. The two golems naturally struck out at him, sending streaks of
mysterious knife-light and sharp sword-light slicing towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Ning
responded with just two streaks of mist-formed sword energy; this was
his Omega Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stance seemed
clumsy and straightforward, but it contained the profundity of his
Omega Sword Dao and his other stances, allowing him to easily strike
his foes head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two strikes from
his two Northbow swords contained power that was comparable to that
of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. The eight-armed golem and
the swordsmen golem were both sent flying backwards. It must be
remembered that even the strongest golem, the stone golem, was unable
to withstand this stance. How could these two possibly do so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now come here.”
Ning’s lips split open into a grin as he faced the stone golem that
was charging towards him, arms spread wide. The swordsman golem and
the eight-armed golem had already been knocked flying backwards; for
the next few moments, they wouldn’t be able to assist the stone
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Ning’s
sword-light drifted out in an ephemeral, mysterious fashion. This was
his Shadowless stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
tri-colored ropes were slowing him down, preventing his sword-light
from being truly traceless and shadow less, it was still incredibly
unpredictable. Although the stone golem was extremely strong and
ferocious, it had major flaws as well; namely, its speed and agility!
When Ning executed this Shadowless stance and infused the
[Heartsword] arts into it, the stone golem was only able to block a
single one of Ning’s swords with its six arms. It was unable to
withstand the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The Northbow
swords furiously and rapidly began to coil around the stone golem
like a soft rope, tying dozens of knots around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” the stone
golem let out a furious bellow. It had wanted to grapple Ning, but
instead it had been captured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.”
Completely bound, the stone golem was unable to fight back at all as
Ning sent out his will, forcefully drawing the golem into his
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, move to
block the swordsman golem.” Ning turned, focusing his gaze on the
nearby eight-armed golem which was once more seeking to charge at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
was excited as well. The other five Emperor-class golems, however,
began to panic!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s initial
clashes against them had been nothing more than probes designed to
help him understand what the golems were skilled in, so as to prepare
a proper battle plan! The initial clashes had let him understand that
the flame golem, lightning golem, and mist golem all had abilities
that were similar to ‘invulnerable forms’; there was nothing he
could do to them at all. Thus, Ning turned his attention to the other
three golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone golem had
seemed to be the strongest and most ferocious, but its flaws were
also the most obvious. In the end, it was the easiest one to deal
with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stone’s been
captured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord is too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master commands us
to retreat immediately!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has commanded
a retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three clan leaders
had immediately received word that even though their six
Emperor-class golems had assaulted Daolord Darknorth in unison, one
of them had ended up being captured. They immediately issued an order
to withdraw! The loss of every single Emperor-class golem, to the
three great clans, was quite painful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! The
eight-armed golem and the swordsman golem immediately began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t going
anywhere.” Ning’s heartworld projection and nine novessence arts
were completely focused on suppressing the eight-armed golem and
swordsman golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s first target
was the eight-armed golem, and he charged towards it by himself. Both
sides were being slowed and restricted, but Ning was faster than the
eight-armed golem to begin with! The difference between them in power
was apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run! Run!” The
eight-armed golem was panicking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t running
anywhere.” Ning caught up, then used his Omega Sword Dao -
Shadowless to once more launch an unpredictable sword-art attack
against the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight-armed golem
was clearly quite agile, and its eight arms set up a mysterious
defensive pattern to defend. As for Ning, he alternated between the
Shadowless stance and the Heavenbreaker stance, sometimes also
switching to the incredibly fast Blood Drop stance! Just three
breaths of time later, the eight-armed golem’s defenses had been
penetrated. One of Ning’s swords wrapped directly around the
eight-armed golem’s waist, the Northbow sword having transformed to
become long and soft as it wrapped itself around the golem like a
ball.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
drew the eight-armed golem into his estate-world as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be
happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this Daolord
be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you really are courting death!” The three golems which made up the
tri-colored ropes were howling furiously, but they were even weaker
than the eight-armed golem in close combat. When used to bind and
slow Ning, they were quite effective, but once they stopped doing so
and Ning was able to unleash his full power… their defeat would be
swift and sure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha! None of you
are escaping!” Ninedust transformed into a sea of water as he
furiously battled against the swordsman golem. The water coiled
around the golem, with Ninedust’s upper body visible as he used his
longstaff to batter the swordsman golem at will. Given that the
swordsman golem was being affected by both the heartworld projection
and the nine novessence arts, Ninedust was able to completely
dominate it. It had no chance to flee at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no, NO! Get the
hell away from me!” The swordsman golem was furiously struggling
but unable to shake off Ninedust. Finally, Ning arrived. With Ning
and Ninedust fighting together the swordsman golem was caught in
literally a single second, then drawn into the estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three elemental
golems realized that there was nothing they could do. They had no
choice but to quickly flee and retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tianello, Maji, and the
others hadn’t moved too far away. They were able to watch this
fight from afar. Truth be told, their situation was quite grim; they
were terrified that the three great clans would view them as being a
party to this and blame them, and thus they didn’t dare to move too
far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying.”
They stared at the battlefield, the Cranesoar Mountains having been
reduced to rubble long ago. The few mountains that remained were
covered with the vicious scars of battle. All of this had been caused
by the shockwaves generated from the earlier clashes. It must be
remembered that this was a planet the Sithe had created and placed
within the Stone Hellephant Wall. This planet was extremely stable
and sturdy, but the shockwaves from this battle alone had been enough
to annihilate most of the nearby mountains. This was more than enough
to terrify Tianello and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two Daolords
actually won. They actually won. They beat the three great clans.”
Tianello, Maji, and the others could hardly believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, we actually
acquired three Emperor-class golems.” Ninedust said delightedly,
“How absolutely wonderful. I hope they send a few more over for us
to capture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t get cocky.”
Ning had a serious look on his face. “Even though I had my
heartworld projection and my nine novessence arts active, the
restrictive effected generated by just three of those golems was
enough to drop me to 70% of my maximum power. I doubt the three great
clans sent their full forces against us. If they were able to drop me
to 40% of my full power, things will get dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Startled,
Ninedust immediately nodded. “How strong are these three great
clans, exactly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not sure.”
Ning shook his head, then grinned. “But those three golems should
know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three golems?”
Ninedust’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to bind them
immediately and have them spill the secrets they know regarding the
three great clans,” Ning said. “Only when you understand both
yourself and your enemy shall you be the victor in all your battles!
Based on what I can see thus far, the three great clans are much more
powerful than we had predicted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” And so,
Ning and Ninedust immediately began to bind the three captured golems
to themselves.

Chapter 16 - The Three Great Clans
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
subterranean underground of this world. The three silver men were
once again standing by the bubbling lake of lava, but they were no
longer as calm as they were before this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Darknorth not only managed to defeat six Emperor-class golems by
himself, he actually captured three of them.” The muscular silver
man said seriously, “This level of power has completely surpassed
that of any ‘supreme Daolord’ we have ever heard of. Something
like this has never happened since our three great clans have started
our joint rule over this planet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Even though a
few supreme Daolords arise from time to time, all of them were
completely crushed when facing six Emperor-class golems.” The
silver-haired man’s eyes were filled with murder. “This Daolord
Darknorth is definitely the most powerful Daolord our three clans
have ever encountered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One on six, he
managed to capture three Emperor-class golems…” The skinny silver
man shook his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This man was powerful,
more powerful than any ‘Daolord’ should be. Still… this was
what they believed because their horizons were limited. In the
Endless Territories, a vast horde of Daolords would arise every era
of 108,000 chaos cycles, and there were occasionally one or two who
were able to completely eclipse all other Daolords. In this era,
those two were Winesage and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems we have to
personally intervene if we wish to defeat Daolord Darknorth.” The
skinny silver man’s eyes were filled with the desire to do battle.
“How about this? I’ll spar against this Daolord Darknorth first.
If I’m able to kill him by myself, I will. If I’m not, you two
can join in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t be the
slightest bit overconfident against a foe like this. Let’s use our
full power immediately,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. We need to
go to maximum power immediately. This Daolord Darknorth was actually
able to defeat six Emperor-class golems… that means he is already
on our level,” the muscular silver man said. “We have to
completely overwhelm and crush him in order to kill him. Not only
should all three of us work together, all of the Emperor-class golems
in our three clans which possess invulnerable forms should be
activated as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re going to
activate all our golems with invulnerable forms?” The other two
silver men were shocked by this. Any of the three were capable of
fighting Darknorth; for all three to work together was already an
incredible show of power. Were they really going to send an group of
Emperor-class golems as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re going to
go at him full-force, then let’s make sure he has no chance at
all,” the muscular silver man said. “Daolord Darknorth is the
most powerful enemy our three great clans have ever encountered in
our history. Thus… let’s give him the respect he deserves. All
three clan leaders and all invulnerable Emperor-class golems are
going to attack simultaneously. Hmph. He should be proud, even in
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To die to such a
force is indeed prideworthy.” The other two both laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On my orders,
activate all 156 clan-guarding formations and activate the Sithe
disc. Be on maximum alert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On my orders,
activate all 180 formations and activate the Sithe disc.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone is to be on
maximum alert. Activate all formations and activate the Sithe disc.”
The three clan leaders send orders to their clans. Their first goal
was to protect and ensure the safety of their clans. If their clans
were doomed, their own survival wouldn’t matter. After having
undergone the Ritual Sacrificium they were no longer real
‘cultivators’ and were unable to have any progeny of their own.
Thus, if the other members of the clan all perished it would
represent the true and final destruction of their lineage… and once
they reached their lifespan limits they would die as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the protection of
the clan superseded everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All clan-protecting
formations have been activated? Even the Sithe disc is being
activated? I’ve never heard of the clan entering such a state of
readiness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the Daolord
Darknorth who just challenged our three great clans truly that
powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three clans were
thrown into a state of confusion, with the elites and high-level
members of the clans feeling rather stunned. This was definitely the
highest possible level of vigilance the three clans had ever
activated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!!! A total of elven figures shot through the
skies, with the three silver men at the head. Behind them were a
series of Emperor-class golems that all looked different, including
the mist golem, fire golem, and lightning golem which had attacked
Ning earlier. These eight Emperor-class golems were all of the
invulnerable golems which the three great clans possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth’s
sword-arts are inscrutable and mysterious, and he’s skilled at
capturing golems. However, this time we’ve only brought golems with
invulnerable forms with us; he won’t have a chance to capture them
at all,” the skinny silver man said with a cold smile. “Eight
Emperor-class golems and the three of us… hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s going to be
absolutely demolished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After undergoing the
Ritual Sacrificium, the three of us have become true members of the
Sithe race and gained incredible power. Even though we are the
lowliest, most ordinary members of the Sithe race, we’re still far
beyond these Emperor-class golems in power. Any of us three can fight
Daolord Darknorth on equal footing and perhaps even kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
were extremely confident in their chances. They had no equals in this
world and so they only sparred against each other and the
Emperor-class golems. As a result, they knew that any of them would
be capable of easily defeating six Emperor-class golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They represented the
true apex of combat power in this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Cranesoar Mountains
had long ago been reduced to rubble. The battle between Ning,
Ninedust, and the six original Emperor-class golems had completely
annihilated the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the rubble was a
temporal acceleration cabin. Within the cabin, Ning and Ninedust were
busy binding the golems while accelerating the flow of time. Binding
Emperor-class golems was no easy task, and they had no time to waste.
Ning and Ninedust both knew that the next attack from the three great
clans would come quite soon, and so they had to immediately work to
learn more about the three great clans and thus prepare accordingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Emperor-class
golems were all comparable to supreme Daolords. Fortunately, Ning and
Ninedust were both strong enough to bind them by force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning was
the first to take command over an Emperor-class golem. A look of
respect instantly appeared in the green eyes of the six-armed stone
golem. “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You successfully
bound one?” Ninedust turned to glance at Ning. He himself was still
busy using all his power to try and bind his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! I was faster
than you,” Ning grinned, then began to work on the swordsman golem.
“I have some questions for you.” Although Ning’s full energy
was focused on binding the swordsman golem, this wasn’t too
mentally taxing and so he began to question the stone golem. “How
strong are the three great clans, exactly? How much hidden power do
they have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the stone
golem said respectfully, “All Emperor-class golems had their
memories of life prior to joining the three great clans completely
wiped! Or to be precise… the previous golem-spirits were eradicated
while our souls were slowly nurtured and strengthened by the three
great clans. Thus, we don’t know much about their most important
secrets. Over the course of countless years, however, we have learned
a few things based on our observations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Ning
urged. These Emperor-class golems had simply been living with the
three great clans for far too long; no one in the clans themselves
had been alive for as long as they had! Although some of the most
important clan secrets would never be divulged, a few traces would
inevitably spill out over the course of many years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long, long ago, this
world was in a state of chaos before the three great clans had
risen,” the stone golem began, “But then three people who
referred to themselves as ‘Sithe’ established three mighty clans.
They managed to capture one or two Emperor-class golems from a secret
place, then wiped out the original golem-spirits…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In each generation,
the strongest members of the three great clans have always been those
three clan leaders. Each time, they start off as normal cultivators,
but once they become clan leaders they will be transformed into
silver men who will gain inconceivable power,” the stone golem
said. “And every so often, the three great clans are able to
capture another Emperor-class golem or two from that secret place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus… over the
course of countless years, every single one of the three great clans
has gained a total of at least five Emperor-class golems.
Emperor-class golems are what the three great clans usually use to
tame their foes! But their greatest power lies in the clan leaders
themselves. The clan leaders are all incredibly powerful, and each
one of them is on par with you, Master,” the stone golem said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned pale when
he heard this. “All three of the clan leaders are able to defeat
six Emperor-class golems by themselves?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The stone
golem replied, “They often spar against us and so we know how
powerful the clan leaders are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a sense of
shock upon hearing this. Judging from the sound of things, the three
clan leaders were what truly gave the three clans power! The
successive generations of clan leaders would occasionally enter that
mysterious place to capture a few Emperor-class golems, allowing them
to build up quite a stockpile over the course of many years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since this mysterious
place held Emperor-class golems within it, Ning suspected that it
probably held the secrets of the Sithe within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And where is this
secret place?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.
Although we were all captured from that place, our original
golem-spirits were all wiped out,” the stone golem said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
They really were being quite careful, wanting to ensure that no
information leaked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
one minute at a time. Ninedust managed to bind the eight-armed golem
as well, while Ning completed the binding of the swordsman golem. The
information they gained from these two golems was essentially the
same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning put away
the temporal acceleration cabin. He stood next to Ninedust, the three
Emperor-class golems behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here they come.”
Ning stared towards the distant skies, where eleven streaks of light
were flying towards them. Leading the group was indeed a trio of
silver men.
</P>

Chapter 17 - The Silver Men
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
all had very distinct auras. They weren’t like actual living
beings; rather, they seemed almost like golems. Their entire bodies
were composed of silver, and Ji Ning couldn’t help but feel as
though he was looking at that onyx humanoid creature he had
encountered in that cave within the Terror Starsea! That onyx
humanoid had been 540,000 meters tall and pitch-black in color, and
it had a giant hole in its chest which Ning and Ninedust had flown
out of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three silver
men make me think of that onyx humanoid we encountered previously,”
Ning mused. “However, there’s an enormous difference in the aura
of power. The onyx humanoid had been able to slay a Hegemon on the
spot and critically injure a second one, causing the second one to
die later on. It was far, far more powerful than these silver men.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
nearby Ninedust had a solemn look on his face as well as he sent
mentally, “Those three silver men remind me of that black creature
we found in the cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they are quite
similar,” Ning sent back. “It seems these three clans truly do
have a deep connection to the Sithe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should be
significantly more powerful than us. What should we do?” Ninedust
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s follow the
first plan for now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His awesome
heartforce projection came crashing down, bringing with it its
illusory mountains, rivers, and the dazzling sword mountain in the
center! The giant heartworld projection pressed down furiously
against the three silver men and the eight Emperor-class golems,
causing the eight golems to instantly slow down. The three silver
men, however, were still able to move at a hundred times the speed of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of them
weren’t slowed down at all by the pressure of my heartworld
projection?” Ning was secretly shocked. “Then take this as well!”
Ning willed nine energy dragons to come thundering out of his body,
coiling around each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ninedust’s
Ripplewater art was incredibly powerful as well, especially now that
Ninedust had reached an even higher level of expertise. Given his
mastery of the Dao of Water, his Ripplewater art was on the same
level as Ning’s nine novessence arts. However, there was no way for
him to ‘fold’ it over Ning’s arts; if they tried, they would
interfere with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The nine energy
dragons swept outwards. The three silver men could feel the pressure,
but they were still able to maintain a speed of a hundred times the
speed of light. The eight Emperor-class golems behind them, however,
slowed down dramatically. They were now able to move at less than
fifty times the speed of light; just flying through the skies was
quite difficult for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you
should join forces,” the silver man who was the leader of the Fumo
clan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.” The
eight Emperor-class golems were looking rather bedraggled, but they
immediately transformed into streaks of energy that formed a
five-colored rope and a tri-colored rope! For five Emperor-class
golems to work together perfectly was the apex of coordination
possible for them. The five-colored rope was extremely powerful in
particular. Still, with the heartworld projection and the nine
novessence arts weighing down on the two ropes, they still flew quite
slowly. They held back the entire squad as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are the three of you
sure that you wish to take on such a dangerous task? I don’t want
you to be taken away right after I spent all that effort binding
you,” Ning sent mentally to the three Emperor-class golems behind
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. We can hold on,” the swordsman golem said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, if the
situation looks grim you should immediately take the three away.
Emperor-class golems aren’t easily acquired, after all,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ninedust nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
manifested three heads and six arms. Six Northbow swords in hand, he
immediately disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
flying through the skies were shocked by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He suddenly
vanished?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
just vanished.” The three of them discovered, to their amazement,
that they couldn’t find any trace of Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to use
his Shadowless evasion art to its full potential within the domain of
his heartworld projection and his nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful. This
Daolord Darknorth is even more powerful than we expected. He didn’t
use this strange evasion art earlier,” the muscular silver man sent
mentally in a serious voice. The other two clan leaders grew cautious
as well. Although they remained extremely confident in their
abilities, the fact that they couldn’t find any trace of Ning
caused them to feel a headache oncoming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry over here.
Let’s force him to reveal himself,” the silver-haired man sent
mentally to the eight Emperor-class golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
Whoosh! Instantly, the five-colored rope began to expand dramatically
in size. Much like how Ninedust was able to transform into a
sea-sized wave, the five-colored rope was able to transform into a
five-colored ocean. With expanded size came lessened power, but only
by covering enough of the surrounding area would they be able to
force Daolord Darknorth to reveal himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the
five-colored sea furiously spread outwards to cover a million, ten
million, a hundred million kilometers. It continuously expanded,
quickly covering the area around the three silver men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
snort rang out as a white-robed youth showed himself. He had three
heads, six arms, and wielded six Northbow swords in his hands. His
figure looked like a sword as he used the Blood Drop evasion art,
tearing through the five-colored ocean as he shot towards the nearest
silver man, the skinny one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right on cue.” The
silver man revealed an excited look as he readied the silver spikes
in his two hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! The
spikes released ear-piercing screeches as they stabbed towards Ning
in an almost dreamlike manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sithe, eh?” Ning
was filled with the intent to do battle. His six Northbow swords
transformed into six streaks of mist-formed sword energy as he began
to launch a furious assault against the silver men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank! The mist-formed
sword clashed directly against the sharp spike, the terrifying
collision generating rippling shockwaves that could be seen with the
naked eye and which spread out in every direction. A giant crater was
blasted into the land beneath it, while the few remaining parts of
the Cranesoar Mountains were smashed into dust by the shockwave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the distant
Tianello and Maji, they and the other cultivators who were watching
were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Utterly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is t-t-terrif…
is this the true power of the three great clans? So they had forces
even more powerful than those Emperor-class golems!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this the power of
the one named Daolord Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them felt
stunned. They had already been amazed by how Ning had been able to
defeat the six Emperor-class golems by himself, but that extended
battle had only resulted in the partial destruction of the Cranesoar
Mountains. In this battle between Ning and the three clan leaders,
however, the very first exchange of blows had already completely
destroyed what remained of the mountains. Even the ground around the
mountain had begun to crack into a spiderweb of crevices!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This show of force was
enough to terrify anyone. Even Daolords of the Fourth Step who dared
to move in closer would be instantly annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, others on
this world aside from Tianello and Maji were paying attention to this
battle! Ning’s direct challenge to the three great clans had drawn
quite a bit of attention, especially after he had defeated the first
six Emperor-class golems that had been sent against him. This had
stunned every clan in the world, causing all of them to hasten to the
mountains and watch what would happen next.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the true
power of the three great clans!” The other six ‘great clans’
and the weaker clans were all stunned as they watched from afar. They
felt completely breathless. There was no way at all for them to fight
back against the overwhelming power of the three great clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their heart of
hearts, many of they had dreamed of one day defeating the three great
clans and becoming the rulers of this world… but now, they felt a
sense of complete powerlessness. The difference in power was simply
too vast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Daolord
Darknorth is ridiculously strong as well.” They were amazed by the
power of the three great clans, but they were also stunned by the
strength of Daolord Darknorth. Daolord Darknorth was so strong that
he was able to easily annihilate any of the clans in this world,
aside from the three principal clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the skinny
silver man began to furiously battle against each other, and the
terrifying shockwaves generated by their blows blasted out in every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
power… but what a low level of insight!” Ning and the skinny
silver man exchanged over a hundred blows in that brief instant but
only fought to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In strength alone,
Ning’s opponent was actually quite a bit stronger than him; Ning
was only able to match him through usage of the Heavenbreaker stance.
In terms of speed, the silver man moved at a hundred times the speed
of light! Even with Ning’s nine novessence arts and heartworld
projection active, the silver man was still able to maintain this
speed. This was because the man was simply too powerful; he was
completely capable of resisting the pressure and maintaining this
level of speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… the silver
man’s level of insight into the Dao was just too low! Ning felt
that it was perhaps weaker than that of many second-tier Daolords. It
was perhaps just barely on par with the likes of Patriarch Clearwind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that for cultivators who made it into the higher ranks, their power
generally stemmed from their mastery of the Dao. Ning had an
incredibly high level of insight into the Dao, the [Heartsword] art,
and the Northbow swords… that was why he possessed such power! The
silver men had a much lower level of insight into the Dao, but they
were much like golems; their speed and strength were incredible,
allowing them to fight Ning to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has an
overwhelming amount of power but is only able to put a fraction of it
to good use. If I had such speed and strength, I’d be able to take
down ten of them.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. “No wonder
those three Emperor-class golems we just bound said that so long as
Ninedust helps them out while they are working together, they won’t
be captured.

Chapter 18 - All Abilities Unleashed
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had been able
to easily capture the Emperor-class golems because he had a high
level of insight into the Dao. His Shadowless stance was completely
unpredictable, while his Blood Drop stance was incredibly fast,
making it hard for the golems to defend against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the silver men?
Although they were strong and fast, their strikes were too direct and
clumsy! Although these clumsy strikes were very forceful, it wasn’t
too hard to block them; at most, you would be knocked flying from the
power. In a one-on-one fight, they might be able to capture an
Emperor-class golem, but all three of them were working together and
were being assisted by Ninedust and Ning. It was highly unlikely that
any of them would be recaptured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m clearly
stronger than him, but I’m unable to dominate him.” The skinny
silver man sent mentally, “Hurry over here. Surround him and kill
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
other two silver men charged forwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surrounded by the
five-colored sea of energy, Ning was weakened and only able to
unleash 80% of his full power! Despite that, his high level of
insight into the Dao allowed him to fight the skinny silver man to a
standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
muscular silver man wielded two silver warhammers while the
silver-haired man wielded a pair of long silver sabers. All three of
the silver men began to surround and furiously attack Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dead meat.”
The three silver men were brimming with killing intent. At the same
time, the tri-colored rope snaked over towards Ning as well. However,
the three Emperor-class golems and Ninedust immediately transformed
into streaks of light that shot towards the tri-colored ropes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your opponent is
us!” Ninedust transformed into a vast wave that wrapped itself
around the tri-colored rope, while the three Emperor-class golems
launched repeated attacks that caused the tri-colored rope to break
apart, reform, and break apart again repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tri-colored rope
had been tied down by Ninedust and the three Emperor-class golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five-colored rope
had transformed into a five-color sea that was weakening Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
were attacking Ning at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an utterly
apocalyptic battle! Massive shockwaves blasted the surrounding area
repeatedly. The nearby mountains had long ago been annihilated, while
the earth itself had caved in. The other six great clans and the
standard clans who were watching from afar were in a state of shock.
This was a battle that engendered both admiration and despair in
their hearts. They weren’t even close to being able to fight
against foes like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! You are too
weak. You clearly possess tremendous power, but you are only able to
put a fraction of it to good use.” Ning was in his three-headed,
six-armed form as he fought against the three by himself, but he
wasn’t at any disadvantage at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? Why can’t we even suppress or dominate him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
strong?” The three silver men were all stunned. Just one of them
was enough to fight Ning to a standstill… so why was it that all
three of them working together were only achieving the same effect?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because when
Ning was fighting against the six Emperor-class golems and the skinny
silver man, his strategy was to fight them head-on and meet them
attack for attack! Now that three silver men were fighting him at the
same time, Ning primarily relied on his defensive sword-arts and only
launched the occasional attack. His Soleheart stance and his Yin-Yang
stance were simply too powerful, especially after the Northbow swords
had absorbed all of that frozen ninesong pith. His defensive
sword-arts had reached an incredible level of prowess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s defensive
sword-arts were so perfect that he would be able to hold out against
anything save for an utterly overwhelmingly superior level of power.
Given how clumsy these silver men’s attacks were and how low a
level of insight into the Dao they had, Ning found it very easy to
defend against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about three;
I’d probably be able to defend against six of these silver men,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take rope form and
bind him!” the muscular silver Fumo clan leader sent mentally to
the five-colored sea. Instantly, the five-colored sea began to
rapidly shrink in size. It once more transformed into the
five-colored rope and coiled towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rope?” Ning
immediately moved. Whoosh! The five-colored rope was only able to
move at less than fifty times the speed of light due to the
heartworld projection and the nine novessence arts, while Ning was
able to move much faster. He was able to effortlessly dodge the
five-colored rope and immediately used his Shadowless evasion art to
disappear without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once our golems take
rope form and shrink in size, Daolord Darknorth is able to easily
avoid it.” The three silver men were beginning to grow anxious.
Ning was no fool; he wasn’t just going to stand there like an idiot
and allow the five-colored rope to bind him. The reason why he had
done so against the tri-colored rope in his first battle against the
six golems was because he was so completely sure in his chances that
he didn’t even want to bother with dodging, instead choosing to
exchange attacks. Now, however, Ning didn’t dare to act with such
arrogance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golems, maintain a
size of ten million kilometers,” the silver-haired man was forced
to order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a size of ten
million kilometers, the combined attacks of the three silver men
ensured that there was nowhere for Ning to run. This size was enough
to keep Ning at just 70% of his maximum power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s just
nothing we can do to him.” The three silver men furiously assaulted
Ning, but even at 70% power Ning’s defenses were airtight, even
though he was now forced to completely focus on defense and was only
able to launch the occasional attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if another silver
man came, Ning would still be able to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nonti clan leader
and Juwah clan leader, the three of us have done everything we can.
This Daolord Darknorth’s defensive sword-arts are even more
formidable than his offensive sword-arts. There is nothing we can do
to him,” the muscular silver man sent mentally. “The three of us
and these golems are completely unable to kill him. There’s nothing
else we can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we’re out of
other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really didn’t
want to do this… but we’ll have to use it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
exchanged a glance. This Daolord Darknorth was the most dangerous
disaster to ever befall their three great clans! All three of them
were on par with him, but even working together with the assistance
of the five-colored rope they were still unable to do anything to
him. Their failure to kill him was already shaking their control over
this world. They absolutely could not permit this to continue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The muscular
silver man produced a deep-blue oval treasure that was covered with
layers of wriggling runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you should feel proud to die to this Sithe treasure.” The skinny
silver man produced an ancient banner that was blood-red and covered
with a strange, evil-looking beast diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The
silver-haired man took out a black bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately felt a
sense of danger. “Not good. Come forth!” Ning produced a
snow-white lotus flower in his hands. The lotus instantly bloomed,
with Ning standing at the very center. The layers of lotus leaves
which appeared around Ning began to swivel, while Ning was within the
bud at the very center which was completely covered by the first
layer of petals. Ning was able to see through the semi-translucent
petals and sense what was happening outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Ning and Ninedust had acquired Winesage’s vast hoard of
treasures as well as the treasures owned by Timedream, Kingfreak, and
numerous second-tier Daolords. Some of the weaker ones that weren’t
very useful, he had left behind for the Three Realms or to Su Youji
and the others, but the useful ones he had kept on him. This one was
one of the three most supreme defensive treasures in Ning’s
possession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Screeeech! The layers
of wriggly runes on the deep blue oval disc in the hands of the
muscular silver man suddenly began to light up, emanating an
ear-piercing screech as they did so. At the same time, a light blue
sonic wave burst forth from the treasure and shot towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The light blue sonic
wave easily pierced straight through the snow-white lotus; the lotus
wasn’t able to defend against it at all. Ning struck out with his
sword, but it didn’t make any contact with the sonic wave at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound dove into his
body, smashing straight against Ning’s soul and truesoul. Ning’s
truesoul and soul were protected by the azureflower mist energy;
although both trembled slightly, they didn’t suffer any harm at all
and managed to endure the hit head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
attack. It struck at the soul and truesoul?” Ning was secretly
stunned. He stared intently at his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. The attacks
from the other two silver men arrived as well. The black bottle had
already shattered, a black flame erupting from it which quickly
‘glued’ itself over the snow-white lotus flower. Hissing crackles
could be heard as the snow-white flower immediately began to tremble,
but then the lotus began to swivel once more. Although the black fire
which had been ‘pasted’ on the petals were enough to cause them
to tremble, the other petals helped spread the pressure and thus the
flower withstood the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the power of
the black flames was completely used up. The snow-white lotus flower
had dimmed considerably as well and was rather wobbly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strange beast
depicted on the ancient blood banner suddenly let out a furious
bellow. Boom! A blood-red beast came flying out from the banner,
which evaporated in its wake. The blood-red beast’s eyes gleamed
with brutal, murderous red light. It seemed to represent the
incarnation of slaughter itself as it charged straight towards the
snow-white lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The snow-white
lotus continued to swivel as it strove to hold on, but in the end it
was still broken apart. After shattering the lotus, the blood-red
beast charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning no
longer sensed much danger, and so he struck out with his sword to
defend. Boom! A terrifying explosion rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-red beast
repeatedly struck out with its sharp claws while Ning used his swords
to defend. In the end, Ning was able to survive thanks to his
powerful defensive sword-arts, with the Hegemon armor also having
helped him endure the many blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWOOO!” The
blood-red beast grew dimmer and dimmer, first turning an ordinary
red, then turning pink. Finally, it unhappily raised its head to let
out a resentful howl before completely vanishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed on the
ground, a hint of blood on the corner of his lips. He glanced at the
three silver men in the distance, looks of shock on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s do
that again,” Ning growled. “Let’s see if you have more
treasures or if I have more treasures.” As Ning spoke he waved his
hand and caused one treasure after another to appear in front of him,
not suppressing their auras in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” The
three silver men exchanged glances. They weren’t able to beat
Darknorth in a straight fight. Now, it seemed as though Daolord
Darknorth had quite a few treasures of his own. Every single treasure
they possessed had been laboriously acquired from that secret place
and had been left behind by the Sithe. There were very few of them,
and each one they used up represented a permanent loss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
The three silver men felt rather lost. They suddenly realized that
there was nothing at all they could do to this Daolord Darknorth.
</P>

Chapter 19 - Darknorth Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, treasures? We
brothers have plenty of’m!” Ninedust had transformed into a vast
wave, but he now manifested his upper body and sent out one powerful
treasure after another to appear in front of him. The Daolords of
this world didn’t have that many treasures, but Ninedust and Ji
Ning came from the Endless Territories. As a result, they had quite a
few.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The three
silver men saw the many treasures hovering in front of the distant
Ninedust and could sense the terrifying ripples of power emanating
from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the weaker
Daolord has that many treasures on him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
they find so many treasures? Isn’t the secret location accessible
to our three clans alone? We’ve completely searched through every
corner of this entire world; the only place with many treasures
secreted within it is that secret place. The other places shouldn’t
have that many treasures. Where did these two Daolords find so many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
were extremely anxious. They exchanged glances at each other. “Fall
back for now,” the muscular silver man commanded. Whoosh. Whoosh.
The five-colored rope and the tri-colored rope began to retreat,
moving towards the three silver men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust and the three
golems flew towards Ning. The two sides stared at each other from
afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to
fight, let’s fight,” Ninedust called out loudly. “What’s the
point of just standing there blankly? It’s gonna be a war of
attrition via treasures, right? Come on! You use one, I use one…
let’s see who has more. I want to see if you end up dead or if we
end up dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The three
silver men were absolutely enraged. They were exalted figures who
were the absolute rulers over this world. They have never been
challenged and mocked like this before! They were enraged, but after
this battle they realized that there was nothing they could do in
battle to this Daolord Darknorth. His defenses were incredibly tough
and airtight, giving them no chance to win at all; if they wanted to
win, they would have to use the treasures the Sithe had left behind.
Unfortunately, they had extremely few of those treasures! Their
treasures possessed great power… but it seemed as though these two
Daolords also had quite a few treasures of similar power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we really do
compete against them in treasures, once we clean out their stockpile
we might be able to kill… but what if we’re the ones who are
cleaned out instead? What should we do?” the skinny silver man sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we use up all the
treasures, we won’t be able to pose any threat to Daolord Darknorth
at all.” The silver-haired man sent back mentally, “By then,
he’ll have nothing to fear at all and will become even more of a
problem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many treasures they
had accumulated were the final cards they had to play. They weren’t
willing to use them all up. If they did, they might win… but they
might also lose! They weren’t willing to accept what losing would
entail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth…
let’s just wait and see who has the last laugh.” The muscular
silver man let out a cold snort. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The three silver men led the eight Emperor-class golems soaring
through the skies as they departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched from afar
as they left, a hint of a smile playing around his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what
should we do next?” Ninedust began to worry. “They are more
powerful than us, after all. Your sword-arts are defensively strong
enough to ensure they can’t do anything to us, but we can’t do
anything to them either. If this stalemate continues, there’s no
way we’ll be able to find the treasures hidden within this Stone
Hellephant Wall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The reason
why they were fighting and risking their lives was to gain the
treasures of the Sithe! Just from the Emperor-class golems and the
three silver men alone, both Ning and Ninedust felt absolutely
certain that there was definitely a Sithe treasure trove here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s establish
ourselves in this world first,” Ning said. “Then we’ll search
for that secret place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s our only
choice.” Ninedust nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
turned to glance at the land behind him. The Cranesoar Mountains had
been leveled long ago, but with but a thought Ning caused his
heartworld projection to descend, using it to take control over the
local earth and stones to establish a new, towering mountain that was
ten thousand kilometers tall. At the very peak of the mountain, a
top-grade Eternal estate descended in the form of an Immortal’s
palace. At the very top of the palace gates, two characters could be
seen: ‘DARK’ ‘NORTH’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Daolord
Darknorth, on this day do establish the Darknorth Palace here. I do
not seek hegemony; I only seek to cultivate the Dao. Those who stand
in the way of my Dao shall end up like the mountains and rivers
around the three great clans… destroyed!” Ning flew towards the
entrance of the Darknorth Palace, sending his voice out to fill every
single inch of this entire world. At the same time, he enveloped the
entire planet with his heartworld projection, sending it smashing
downwards towards the three great clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
were protected by layers of formations and barriers, but the
surrounding mountains and rivers were instantly annihilated by the
tremendous force of Ning’s heartworld projection, strong enough to
slay even Daolords of the Fourth Step with ease. The area around the
three great clans was instantly obliterated and rendered incredibly
unsightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the world
from ordinary mortals to the three great clans all heard his voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-he actually dares
to trample over our…” the silver-haired silver man’s face was
ugly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him. Damn him!”
The skinny silver man was enraged as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was trampling over
the three great clan’s dignity, so as to establish his own power.
This was a way for him to show that the Darknorth Palace didn’t
give a damn about the three great clans at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He claims that he
doesn’t seek hegemony and only seeks to cultivate the Dao?” The
muscular silver man sent puzzledly to the others, “If he only seeks
to cultivate the Dao, why has he chosen to challenge our clans?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I think his true
goal lies with that secret place of ours,” the skinny silver man
said with a cold smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, that has to be
it.” The silver-haired man’s voice was equally cold. The secret
place was what the three great clans relied upon and was for their
use only. There was no way any other cultivators would be permitted
to so much as find it. As they saw it, given how Daolord Darknorth
already stood at the very apex of power in this world and had nothing
to fear, he definitely was coveting their secret place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s voice echoed
throughout this entire world, with even mortal children able to hear
it clearly. Everyone knew that this ‘Daolord Darknorth’ was
incredibly powerful and had established a place known as the
Darknorth Palace. He didn’t even hold the three great clans in any
regard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t believe
this was the end result of it all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three great
clans are transcendent, supreme entities that have governed this
world since time immemorial. The three clan leaders in particular are
unfathomably powerful; supposedly, they are far more terrifying than
even Emperor-class golems. They can cause hurricanes with a flick of
their fingers that can annihilate even Daolords of the Fourth Step…
but they actually weren’t able to do anything to this Daolord
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He established
Darknorth Palace… that means our world is no longer completely
under the control of the three great clans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavens
themselves are changing before our very eyes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many clans in this
world all understood exactly what was happening… and just as they
expected, the rise of Darknorth Palace really did symbolize that
there were now two supreme powers within this world! This was now a
bipolar world. On one side were the three great clans; on the other,
Darknorth Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The advantage of the
three great clans lay in the fact that they had extremely deep
resources and tremendous power. Darknorth Palace, however, had an
advantage in that Ning’s heartworld projection was able to
instantly encompass this entire planet… in other words, if he
wanted to attack, he had the power to annihilate everything outside
the headquarters of the three great clans!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This power of absolute,
instantly annihilation caused quite a few clans to fear Darknorth
Palace even more. Some particularly ambitious clans chose to make a
rather risky bet… they chose to submit to the rule of Darknorth
Palace. Ning didn’t refuse any comers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, leave these
matters to me. I used to command the Ninedust Sect; organizing and
commanding these minor clans is simplicity itself.” Ninedust was
quite eager to take on this task. “If we can’t find the secret
place ourselves, we might be able to learn some information about it
from these clans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Ninedust’s
leadership and with more and more clans joining their ranks,
Darknorth Palace began to grow in power at an exponential rate. This
was quite a troubling matter for the three great clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no choice
but to bear it for now. Those weaker clans are nothing; if and when
we choose to attack, we can wipe them out with ease. Our greatest foe
remains Daolord Darknorth.” The three clan leaders forebore from
taking action.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
once our clans enter the secret place we need to spare no expense in
finding a treasure that can be used against Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, two thousand years passed after Ning had established
Darknorth Palace in this world. He had continuously searched for the
secret place this entire time, while Ninedust had coordinated the
many clans under the banner of Darknorth Palace to do the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nightfall. A cold wind
was howling through the skies. Ning was seated atop a dais within
Darknorth Palace, staring at the vast world before him as he trained
in the [Heartsword] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord, the
Hallmaster of the First Southern Hall has something important to
report,” an attendant said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something
important?” Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years,
Ninedust had divided Darknorth Palace up into many different
branches, with the First Southern Hall being one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have him come see
me,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Palace Lord.”
The attendant immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, a
black-armored man walked in, then fell to his knees and said
respectfully, “Your subordinate greets you, Palace Lord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may rise. Speak.
What is it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored man
rose to his feet, a hint of eagerness in his eyes as he looked at
Ning. It was Palace Lord Darknorth who was able to ensure that the
three great clans were helpless against them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate has
come into possession of certain information… and I think there is
at least an 80% chance that it has to do with that secret place,”
the black-armored man said respectfully.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An 80% chance?” Ji
Ning stared at the black-armored man. For a subordinate to dare claim
an 80% chance of being correct meant that he was almost virtually
certain; he had to factor in a bit of modesty, after all. “Go ahead
and tell me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord, please
take a look.” The black-armored man produced a scroll in his hands
which he offered respectfully to Ning. Ning waved his hand, causing
the scroll to fly over towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning unfurled the
scroll, which was covered with dense clusters of tiny characters.
These were the last words of a free-spirited Daolord whose lifespan
was coming to an end. It included some of his supreme legacies as
well as the secrets he knew about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened. “This Daolord actually entered the borders of a
mysterious place by accident. He was almost discovered but thankfully
was lucky enough to escape detection… and that place had an
incredibly powerful garrison stationed there?” Ning nodded. This
information the deceased Daolord had written down almost certainly
referred to the secret place Ning was searching for! Aside from the
three great clans, there were no other forces capable of stationing
such a tremendously powerful garrison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it is in a
standalone dimension. No wonder my heartworld projection filled every
inch of this planet but still was unable to find it.” Ning revealed
a trace of a smile. He had finally found it. After two thousand years
here on this planet, he had finally found information regarding the
secret location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense. No
matter how careful the three great clans were, a few traces would
eventually slip through over the course of countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning
looked at the black-armored man, then smiled. “You’ve done quite
well, and I certainly need to reward you for your great
accomplishment.” As Ning spoke, he waved a finger, sending a stream
of light into the black-armored man’s body. The black-armored man
instantly felt his sea of consciousness tremble as an enormous amount
of information began to flood into him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had taken many
precious items away from Sectlord Timedream and the other Daolords,
including good cultivation techniques. He casually chose a decent one
which would guide this man to becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the black-armored
man came back to his senses, he was so excited he immediately fell to
his knees. “Thank you, Palace Lord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
were so exalted precisely because they maintained an extremely strict
level of control over their cultivation techniques. Lesser clans
would never have access to the knowledge of the ancestors, and so
they were forced to train blindly. This made becoming a Daolord
extremely difficult, much less one capable of reaching the fourth
step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had this
technique from Ning, not only would he become a Daolord, even his
other clansmen would stand a good chance at it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Ning
instructed. When searching for information regarding the secret
place, these subordinates had sworn lifeblood oaths in advance that
they were only able to divulge this information to their superiors
and not to any outsiders at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust.” Ning
sat there atop the dais, staring into the dark night sky as he sent a
mental message to Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
manifested next to him. It was the Ninedust Sectlord. Ninedust said
with some surprise, “It’s past midnight. Why did you suddenly
call for me? Want to grab a drink?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look at
this.” Ning tossed the scroll to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust accepted it
and gave it a read. A look of delight instantly appeared on his face.
“Haha, we brothers have finally found this so-called ‘secret
place’! But from the looks of it, the three great clans guard it
very tightly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord who
wrote down this scroll only entered the outermost border regions by
accident,” Ning said. “I believe that the three great clans must
have set up layers of protective mechanisms and defenses; there’s
no way an outsider would be able to easily penetrate it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
nodded. The secret place was most likely what allowed the three great
clans to rise to prominence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m planning to
head out tonight to inspect this location,” Ning said. “I’ll
used the Shadowless evasion art and avoid discovery as best as I can!
As for you, if you wish to join me you’ll have to enter my
estate-world treasure for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I’m
going with you. The entire reason why I’m in this world is because
I’m interested in the Sithe’s local treasury,” Ninedust said
hurriedly. “Those three clan leaders are at a lower level of
insight than me, but they are incredibly strong in battle and have
all those Emperor-class golems… how could I give up a chance to
acquire such a fortune?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I knew you’d
come. Let’s go.” As Ning spoke, he sent mental messages to his
four highest-ranking subordinates to temporarily take control over
Darknorth Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Ning
and Ninedust quietly slipped away from Darknorth Palace that very
night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had scanned this
world many times with his heartworld projection, and so he knew its
geography very well! Now that he had that scroll, Ning was able to
guess as to approximately where this place was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, this planet
was still a few billion kilometers in diameter. If Ning had been
forced to search through every inch of it, ten million years wouldn’t
have been enough. This place was something which even a heartworld
projection was unable to discover… even if he was just a meter away
from it, he probably wouldn’t be able to recognize it for what it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a tree
roughly nine meters thick. Once you touch it, you’ll immediately be
able to enter that secret place.” After pulling Ninedust into his
estate-world, Ning immediately activated the Shadowless evasion art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning silently
and soundless arrived in the rough location mentioned by the Daolord.
He quickly eliminated the more slender trees from consideration. He
was looking for something at least nine meters thick… as Ning saw
it, this so called tree which held the secret location within it
probably wasn’t an actual tree, just something disguised as one. It
probably would never change in appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tap. Tap. Tap. Ning
silently reached out to tap one tree after the other. His fingers
were very gentle, ensuring that he generated no sound at all. He
ended up spending two full days within the general region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tap. Ning casually
tepped on the trunk of yet another large and leafy green tree in
front of him… but his finger went straight through it. A sucking
power was suddenly applied to his entire body as well. Ning was
overjoyed and didn’t seek to resist, allowing himself to be drawn
inside of the great tree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space twisted and
turned around him. He was surrounded by emptiness, with only a giant
towering mountain in front of him. Ning had appeared at the base of
the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning kept the
Shadowless evasion art active as he carefully scanned his
surroundings. “This massive mountain is actually hanging in empty
space… was this done by the Sithe?” He was able to vaguely gaze
through the void around him and see the forest outside. Clearly,
outsiders weren’t able to discover this place but those inside were
able to see who was outside at any time. In fact, just a single step
was needed to leave this place and return to the forest in the
outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. The garrison
stationed here really is powerful.” Ning immediately saw an
garrison stationed roughly a thousand kilometers away from him. This
garrison had two Emperor-class golems, six Samsara Daolords, and a
very large number of World-level cultivators. There was also a giant
cave entrance halfway up the mountain which led deep into its heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain cave was
dark and unfathomably deep, and it was covered by layers of ancient
formations that glowed with hazy light. When Ning saw the barriers,
he felt a vague sense of danger from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These barriers are
meant to prevent people from going inside the mountain,” Ning mused
“Most likely, the Sithe treasury is located within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The barriers
protecting the three great clans were already quite strong. There’s
no way this place isn’t just as well protected. I probably won’t
be able to force my way through the barriers.” Ning knew this to be
true; logically speaking, he shouldn’t be able to breach the
barriers. The vague sense of danger he sensed from the barriers had
already testified to that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forcing his way through
wouldn’t work. It seemed that the only option was to play a few
tricks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned,
his gaze falling upon an enormous tower-shaped formation next to the
garrison. At his current level power, he was able to recognize it
right away. “A spacetime transfer array? It seems so intricate and
marvelous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder I kept
watch over the three great clans for so many years without
discovering how the three great clans entered this place. So this
spacetime transfer array is directly linked to the headquarters of
the three great clans.” Ning couldn’t help but shake his head.
This world was a vast one; the chances of one stumbling upon this
particular tree were incredibly low. Even if someone did enter, the
garrison stationed here would be able to easily slaughter that
person. In the event of failure, the barriers surrounding the
mountain cave would prevent any entry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… time grinds
away at all things. Eventually, there will be a leak. The Daolord who
had left that scroll behind had been able to enter through a lucky
streak of fortune, and he had immediately left carefully. He had only
survived because his luck really was incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?
How are we supposed to go inside? Going inside by force isn’t an
option. It seems we will have no choice but to wait.” Ning stared
at the spacetime transfer array, then secretly shook his head. “Yes,
just wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waiting was a clumsy
method, but sometimes the simplest methods were quite effective!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, did you
go inside yet?” Ninedust asked from within the estate-world. A
white-robed incarnation of Ning appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. I’ve already entered the secret area, but I’m in the
outer regions of it. The entrance leading into the heart of this
region has been blocked off by a barrier. It should’ve been the
three great clans who set this barrier up; I really doubt I can
breach it by force.” Ning shook his head. “Our only choice for
now is to wait. Once the Daolords enter the heart of the region, I
might be able to come up with a way to sneak through as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really are
quite carefully. They actually set up a formation of barriers inside
the secret area’s passageways as well?” Ninedust was speechless.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. Ji Ning kept the Shadowless evasion art active the entire time
and patiently waited outside for more than fifty thousand years. When
it came to acquiring a Sithe treasury, he had patience in abundance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Nonti clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaak. A stone door
swung open and a grim-faced Daolord of the Third Step walked out from
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord!” The
armored soldier outside the door said respectfully, “The clan
leader has send orders. All Daolords must immediately head to the
ancestral grounds whenever they leave their secluded meditations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” This Daolord
of the Third Step, Daolord Joyquill, narrowed his eyes. “What’s
with the urgency? Don’t you normally have to become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step before being able to visit the ancestral grounds?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord, the clan
leader has now changed the rules. Even Daolords of the Second Step
are allowed entry,” the armored soldier said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Daolords of the
Second Step are allowed in?” Daolord Joyquill was shocked. “How
can this be? The ancestral grounds are incredibly dangerous. Success
brings great rewards, but the weak will most likely perish. Although
some Daolords of the Second Step have succeeded in the past, this is
just too dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord, you’ve
been in secluded meditation for many years so you don’t know what
has happened. Our three great clans have encountered a deadly
opponent,” the armored soldier said. “Over fifty thousand years
ago, a Daolord named Darknorth suddenly rose to power. His might was
unmatched and he challenged our three clans all by himself. The
Emperor-class golems we sent out were all defeated, with him
capturing three of them. The three clan leaders then led a force of
eight golems to attack him, but in the end they still weren’t able
to subdue him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Joyquill was astonished. “Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
then established the Darknorth Palace. By now, he is in control of
quite a few clans. He has set himself up in opposition to our three
clans!” The armored soldier continued, “The three clan leaders
have already sent word that we are to charge deep into the ancestral
grounds, regardless of the risk! We need to find as many treasures as
we can from the ancestral lands, so that we can deal with Daolord
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After gaining a more
thorough understanding of what had happened recently, Daolord
Joyquill felt even more stunned. He never would’ve imagined that
the clan would’ve fallen into such dire straits during this session
of secluded meditation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… Daolord
Joyquill stood there within a spacetime transfer array. He mumbled to
himself with a frown as the array started to light up, “Where the
hell did this Daolord Darknorth come from? How did he become this
powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Space and time
twisted around him. By the time everything was clear, he found
himself within the ancestral lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ancestral
lands.” Daolord Joyquill stared at the area around him. Next to him
was a great garrison, while outside was the vast emptiness of space.
Beyond even that was the great forest in the real world outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Joyquill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Joyquill,
you came as well?” The six Daolords stationed here walked out to
welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord
Joyquill nodded. “I received the order right after I left my
meditations and so I immediately came here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. I wonder how
Daolord Darknorth trained and how he became so powerful. All of the
Daolords of the three great clans are now risking their lives
inside.” The six Daolords in charge of the garrison sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most of them will
probably end up dead soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could someone
like Daolord Darknorth have suddenly emerged from those other lowly
clans?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all shook their
heads. They had grown accustomed to feeling superior to all others,
and they didn’t even hold the other six ‘great clans’ in any
regard. As they saw it, all others who were not members of the three
great clans were lowly figures. They were the absolute rulers of this
world, and they had ruled it fearlessly since time out of mind. How
could they not feel enraged at how Daolord Darknorth had suddenly
shaken their positions?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they could do
nothing but sigh and lament at his appearance. The difference in
power between them was simply too great; they weren’t capable of
doing anything to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll head on in,”
Daolord Joyquill said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, brother
Joyquill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully, brother
Joyquill will reap great rewards from this.” The six Daolords all
said a few words of encouragement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! A silent figure
moved close towards Daolord Joyquill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, a new
Daolord has arrived. And, from the looks of things, he’s about to
enter the inner regions.” Ning watched as Daolord Joyquill moved
towards the mountain cave. Ning quickly moved closer to Joyquill,
with no one discovering his presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soulthrall.” By
now, even the Kingfreak would be affected by his soul-mesmerizing
abilities, to say nothing of a weak Daolord of the Third Step like
this. Joyquill was instantly swept into a state of unconsciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While doing this, Ning
set up a thirty meter barrier around them which warped and distorted
light. If anyone glanced towards them, they would see Daolord
Joyquill continuing to walk normally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” Ning
instantly drew Daolord Joyquill into his estate-world. “And… here
I go.” Ning appeared out of nowhere, but he now looked just like
Daolord Joyquill. No… not just looked alike. Even his soul and
truesoul were identical to Joyquill’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
released the barrier around the surrounding area, then glanced around
him before letting out a sigh of relief. The process of setting up
the barrier, catching Daolord Joyquill, then replacing him had
happened almost instantaneously, but if there was a Daolord
specifically keeping a careful watch on this area then it would’ve
still been possible for his actions to be noticed. Thankfully, he
hadn’t been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having put away
Daolord Joyquill, Ning immediately released a small amount of his
energy into his estate-world to question the man. Alas, Daolord
Joyquill had long ago sworn a lifeblood oath regarding this ‘secret
place’; even though his soul had been mesmerized, he wasn’t able
to say a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning questioned
Joyquill for quite some time but didn’t gain much from it. “There’s
nothing for it.” He had no choice but to grit his teeth and walk
forwards! Ning quickly reached the region covered by layers of
barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Joyquill,
I’ve already taken control over the Sithe disk. You can come in,”
a voice rang out from behind the layers of blue barriers of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Sithe disk’?
Ning silently memorized this term. On the surface, he just nodded
slightly as he continued forwards. Indeed, the layers of blue light
were like curtains of water. Ning was able to easily walk in without
the slightest disturbance at all. This barrier-filled region was tens
of thousands of kilometers long, but Ning walked incredibly fast and
was able to quickly bypass it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Joyquill has
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Daolord
Joyquill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Daolords in
charge of the Sithe disk all laughed. They carefully inspected every
person who came in, but they did so primarily through inspection of
the truesoul aura. They weren’t worried about Daolord Joyquill
secretly bringing anyone else inside, because every single Daolord of
the three great clans had long ago sworn lengthy lifeblood oaths. The
part of the oath pertaining to the ancestral lands were particularly
severe and exacting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, even
though Ning had used a soul-mesmerizing technique on the man, he
still wasn’t able to learn any secrets regarding this place!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Joyquill.”
The three seated Daolords looked at him. One of them, an old man with
a large beard, called out in a loud voice, “Be careful after you go
inside. This place is filled with danger, and many of the golems are
filled with enmity towards our clans. All of them are Emperor-class
golems; if they manage to ambush you, you’ll be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” Ning
nodded, many thoughts flashing through his mind. He absolutely had to
acquire the Sithe treasury! However, it seemed as though there was
only one way inside this mountain… and it had been protected by
layers of barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wish to take
the treasury for myself, I’ll probably end up revealing myself!
They will be able to use these barriers to ensure that I’m unable
to leave.” Ning stared at the three Daolords who were controlling
the distant Sithe disk. “I won’t feel secure unless and until I
get rid of them first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Songfloat,”
Ning said while walking towards the three. As the lord of Darknorth
Palace, he held a very high status and thus knew almost all of the
Daolords within this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
bearded elder smiled as Ning walked towards him, completely unafraid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning cracked a
smile as well, sending an invisible wave of power towards them.
Instantly, the three seated Daolords felt a wave of pressure come
crashing down towards them, causing them to go dizzy. Their bodies
slumped to the ground, powerless. Ning instantly moved to stand next
to them, grabbing the strange disk which had been rotating around the
three. The round disk was a deep brown color and covered with many
extremely complex runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ripples emanating
from the disk spread out to cover tens of thousands of kilometers.
The surrounding formations and barriers all had this Sithe disk as
their core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning
reached out to take a firm grip over the round disk, clasping his
hands around it. Rumble… instantly, the layers of formations and
barriers for tens of thousands of kilometers around them began to
rumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guards stationed at
the garrison outside the cave couldn’t help but turn their heads to
look backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Some of the Daolords stationed inside the mountain were able to sense
the ripple as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was the Sithe
disk!” The three silver men immediately transformed into streaks of
light that shot out from the mountain and charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had grabbed at the
Sithe disk twice without being able to pull it to him. He immediately
waved his hand and produced the Northbow sword, executing his Omega
Sword Dao - Blood Drop. This was his most penetrating attack, and it
was the best attack he had for disrupting formations. Slash! Slash!
Slash! It was hard to defeat a formation from the outside, but
breaking it through when you were already inside it was much easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One streak of
mist-formed sword energy after another stabbed into the Sithe disk,
causing some of the supportive formations to immediately break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… Ning finally
managed to dislodge the Sithe disk from its orbit, breaking it free
from the many mysterious formation-runes that had been binding it.
Ning then sent the Northbow sword in his hands to deliver furious
chops towards the world around him, destroying all the formations one
by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” When
Ning saw the three silver men fly towards him, he immediately drew
the Sithe disk into his estate-world.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after putting away
the Sithe disk did Ji Ning feel marginally at ease. Otherwise, the
many barriers it served as the focal point for would’ve been very
problematic for him. Even if he did acquire treasures from within the
mountain, there would’ve been no way out for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How were you able to
disguise yourself as Joyquill? You even managed to emulate his
truesoul’s aura!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
flew towards Ning. They had been shocked when they saw Daolord
Joyquill seize the Sithe disk, but when they saw the Northbow sword
appear in Ning’s hand they immediately knew who he was. They
certainly wouldn’t believe that Daolord Joyquill had the power to
seize a Northbow sword from Daolord Darknorth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
laughed as he transformed back into his own appearance. “You found
out too late,” Ning said as he summoned his awe-inspiring
heartworld projection to cover both this tunnel as well as the
garrison outside. Even the inner depths of the mountain were
completely covered by it… and as it descended, the other Daolords
of the three great clans were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-w-what’s
happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this the
legendary ‘heartworld projection’? Could it be Daolord
Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is our
ancestral grounds, a place hidden from all others and which is
protected by the Sithe disk. How could the heartworld projection have
invaded it?” They all began to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just frowned
slightly. He could sense that although his heartworld projection
covered an extremely large region, there was some sort of energy deep
within the mountain which was able to resist and block his heartworld
projection, making it unable to penetrate any deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soulthrall.” A
wave of heartforce swept outwards. This was Ning’s soul-hypnosis
technique, and it instantly struck all of the Daolords within the
range of his heartworld projection. None of them were able to resist
it at all! Even the Daolords of the Fourth Step were instantly drawn
into a dazed state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you doing!”
The three silver men were shocked and enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What does it look
like I’m doing?” Ning looked back at the three silver men. “Don’t
worry, I’m not planning to kill them. If I wanted to do so, I
would’ve been able to easily eradicate them through my heartworld
projection alone. I wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of putting
them under my control instead…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” The three
silver men were enraged and anxious. The vast majority of the
Daolords of their three clans were all located here! There were one
or two standing guard over their clan, and a few had ventured so deep
into the mountain that they weren’t covered by the heartworld
projection. However, Ning had at least thirty-one Samsara Daolords
under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. If
you can agree to my requests, I’ll release all of them completely
unharmed.” A cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes. “But if
you refuse, then don’t blame me for what I’ll be forced to do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
viewed themselves as the absolute rulers of this world, believing all
other living creatures to be beneath them. They viewed themselves as
the ultimate arbiters of life and death for the others. This
mentality was pervasive in the three great clans, shared by the clan
leaders and clansmen alike. They had always believed this, and after
becoming Samsara Daolords they had only become even more fearless and
lawless. And in truth, they were indeed the rulers of this world. No
one had ever been able to challenge or shake their authority! Only,
the descent of Daolord Darknorth upon this world had shaken their
status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak!” the
muscular silver man commanded with a growl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak. Don’t ask
for too much,” the silver-haired man said, teeth clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My conditions are
simple,” Ning said. “First, you are not permitted to attack me…
but of course, I won’t do anything further to you either. We shall
coexist peacefully. Second, you must tell me all the secrets you know
pertaining to the Sithe, including everything you know about this
mountain. If you agree to both conditions… we still won’t be
friends, but at least we won’t be enemies any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of
cultivators was a world of slaughter and strife. The three great
clans were protected by many formations and barriers; there was no
way for Ning to wipe them out at all. Even if he did, the only result
would be a different organization would rise to rule over this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, Ning
couldn’t even be bothered to get into a real war against these
people. His ultimate goal was to obtain the Sithe treasury! Once he
did, he would immediately leave this place. There really was no need
for him to become enemies with these three clan leaders. They were
far too strong, after all; he wasn’t able to defeat any of them.
Right now, he knew nothing about the depths of this mountain
whatsoever. The three great clans, however, had spent countless aeons
searching and exploring the place. They definitely knew a great deal
about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His enemies knew a
great deal regarding this mountain, while he knew nothing at all. His
enemies were also stronger than him; if they wanted to scheme against
him here, he would probably be in a great deal of danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three clan leaders
exchanged glances as they secretly conversed mentally. Soon, they
clenched their teeth and came to a decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a nice
little fantasy you you.” The muscular silver man, the clan leader
of the Fumo clan, growled out: “Daolord Darknorth, we aren’t able
to accept your conditions due to our ancestral proscriptions. Every
single member of the clan was long ago forced to swear lifeblood
oaths regarding this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face
tightened. Ancestral proscriptions?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But we’ll make it
up to you in other ways.” The Fumo clan leader suppressed his rage
as he spoke: “First, as you’ve requested, we agree to live in
peace with you. Second, you must leave our ancestral lands. We will
never allow anyone who is not a member of our three clans to enter
this place. Third, we’ll give you a gift of three Emperor-class
golems in compensation. In return, we wish to regain our clansmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How generous,”
Ning said dryly. “Three Emperor-class golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our three great
clans have only acquired a few of these golems despite having spent
countless eras scouring this place. To trade you three golems for the
lives of our clansmen is a show of great sincerity,” the skinny
silver man, the Juwah clan leader, said in a sharp and shrill voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree that you are
being quite sincere… but unfortunately, my goal is the Sithe
treasury.” Ning shook his head. “Emperor-class golems? I really
don’t care too much about them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His ultimate goal was a
treasure that could intrigue even an Autarch; only then would he have
a chance at reviving Yu Wei. He needed treasures on par with
Crimsonwave Temple in value. Emperor-class golems weren’t even
close! It must be remembered that the two overseers who had stood
guard over Crimsonwave Temple were Hegemon-class figures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no way
we’ll permit anyone outside of our three clans to enter the
ancestral grounds,” the silver-haired man said in a cold voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely not.”
The muscular silver man’s voice was ice-cold as well. “I strongly
recommend that you accept our conditions…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I should go ahead
and kill them?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are just
Daolords; even if all of them died, we’d be able to raise a new
generation of them in time.” The three silver men didn’t hesitate
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancestral grounds
served as the foundation for the entire clan. There was an enormous
treasury here, and despite having spent countless years scouring the
place they had only acquired a fraction of the treasures in the
outermost layer. If Daolord Darknorth entered, he might find things
that were even better than what they had acquired. He might’ve
sworn an oath not to kill them, but his descendants might use those
treasures to wipe out the three great clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why were the three
great clans so formidable? It was because of the three silver men,
right? But the treasury held things that were even more terrifying
and powerful than the silver men! If Ning acquired them, he would be
able to establish a clan that was even more terrifyingly powerful
than theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I really should
go ahead and kill them?” Ning’s voice was cold as well. Swish!
The Daolord who was located closest to the three clan leaders
instantly had his truesoul snuffed out. His eyes turned completely
blank and dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-!” The three
clan leaders were instantly driven into a state of fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us will
hold him back. You go and rescue as many of our clansmen as you can.”
The muscular silver man and the skinny silver man howled with rage as
they charged towards Ning, while the silver-haired man turned to fly
deep into the mountain, seeking to pull away the Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late.” A
flicker of something baleful flashed through Ning’s eyes. If their
negotiations had fallen through… then so be it. Let them die.
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! One truesoul after another was extinguished
by Ning’s [Heartforce Eradicator]. Not a single person was able to
withstand this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
every single one of the Daolords had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you are dead meat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, Darknorth!
Die!” The two clan leaders went berserk. In the past, they had
always been the ones to hold the power of life and death over others.
There had never been a situation where so many Daolords of their
clans had been instantly annihilated by others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even all three of
you working together weren’t able to do anything to me. What’s
the point of even trying with two?” Ning manifested three heads and
six arms as he drew his six Northbow swords. With his heartworld
projection and his nine novessence arts swirling around him, he was
able to defend against the attacks of the two clan leaders while
moving deeper and deeper into the mountain. Although the two clan
leaders managed to slow him down greatly, he was still able to move
deeper within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. The Nonti clan
leader flew out of the range of my heartworld projection?” Ning
frowned. His heartworld projection merely covered part of the
mountain; deep within the mountain, there was some sort of unknown
energy which was able to resist his heartworld projection. The third
silver man had flown deeper into the mountain and outside of the
range of Ning’s scans.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Another Onyx Humanoid
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired Nonti
clan leader ventured deep into the mountain by himself. When he flew
beyond the range of the heartworld projection, he roared angrily,
“All of you, come back! Come to me and stay away from the
heartworld projection!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Five figures flew straight towards him, moving quite fast as they
retreated from the depths of the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
looked at the five Daolords in front of him, sighing secretly to
himself. These five were the only Daolords left of the many who had
entered the ancestral grounds… and that was counting all three
clans! Even if they factored in the ones standing guard over their
clans, each clan now had just two or three Daolords left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened, clan
leader?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
with that heartworld projection?” They couldn’t help but query
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Daolord
Darknorth. He’s already wiped out all of the other Daolords in the
ancestral grounds.” The silver-haired man’s voice was cold as
ice. “Enough, there’s no time for questions. The other two clan
leaders and I will join forces to kill him inside the ancestral
grounds. Since he came here, he has only himself to blame for his
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
other five Daolords were shocked and enraged. They all ground their
teeth and nodded, filled with hatred towards Daolord Darknorth and
faith in their clan leader. This was because the ancestral grounds
truly were terrifyingly dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
waved his hand, collecting all five of them. As of right now, the
three great clans had almost no Daolords left; every single one of
them was a precious resource.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continuously moved
deeper and deeper into the mountain. Soon, the silver-haired man
returned and joined forces with the other two clan leaders in
attacking Ning. Alas, it was useless; they hadn’t been able to do
anything to Ning even when they had eight Emperor-class golems
assisting them. Their chances were even slimmer now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are more
familiar with this place than me. I can’t let them trick me.”
Ning was secretly on maximum alert as he slowly delved deeper into
the mountain. Palaces and other buildings gradually began to appear
within the mountains, a mixture of black and gold elegance. However,
the buildings were all completely shattered and destroyed, with giant
claw marks occasionally seen. It was as though a single sharp set of
claws had been used to tear through these buildings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We saw these claw
marks in the outer layer of the Stone Hellephant Wall as well,”
Ning mused. “It seems as though the same person fought his way all
the way here. This should be the true core of the Stone Hellephant
Wall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those elegant palaces
had some treasures floating in the air above them. Although the
treasures and the palaces had both been wrecked, they still emanated
auras of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three clan leaders
had originally been launching attacks nonstop against Ning. They
gradually began to slow their attacks, but they continued to circle
around him with smirks on their faces as they looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have visited the
ancestral grounds countless times over the course of countless
generations. This Daolord Darknorth truly is courting death, for him
to dare barge into this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to kill him
as soon as we can. Once more time passes and he grows familiar with
this place, it’ll become much harder to scheme against him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let us kill him
quickly.” The three clan leaders secretly planned out their next
stratagem, allowing Ning to advance as he pleased in the meantime. As
for Ning, he remained vigilant; he wouldn’t dare to be
overconfident here in a Sithe relic site!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Ning used
his nine novessence arts to attack the surrounding area with wild
abandon. If there were any traps here, he wanted to use his nine
novessence arts to activate them at a distance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Whoosh! Some
barriers did indeed flare with power, but Ning’s nine novessence
arts had activated them from ten million kilometers away and so they
didn’t harm Ning in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
being quite careful. By relying on his secret arts, he’s able to
avoid many dangerous places.” The three clan leaders were so angry
their teeth hurt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. Once he
goes deeper inside, his heartworld projection and his secret arts
will be useless,” the skinny silver man said through clenched
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning suddenly saw a corpse that had been split in half. The corpse
was so large, it was like a pair of mountains lay there amidst the
palatial rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw a pitch-black
humanoid figure whose midsection had been sliced in half. Judging
from how the wound had been torn open, the person had clearly been
torn in half by a pair of sharp claws. Ning could even see the many
countless stone passageways located deep within the body itself. He
could immediately recognize that this bisected onyx humanoid was the
same as the onyx humanoid he had seen in the Terror Starsea, the one
which had caused the deaths of two Hegemons of the Endless
Territories in the Dawn War. Their auras were absolutely identical
and gave Ning the same sense of pressure and might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was a-actually
torn in half?” Ning was stunned. “This creature was capable of
bringing down Hegemons with it! Even the Ancient Hegemon was only
able to just barely pierce a hole through that onyx humanoid’s
chest… but this one was actually torn in half?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clearly remembered
just how terrifyingly powerful the first one had been. The golden
sand from the planet within its body had been enough to cause his
Northbow swords to evolve and transform!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning reached
out to grab at the upper half of the black humanoid’s corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The three
clan leaders circling around him didn’t move to stop him. They just
watched with cold smiles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt like he was
an ordinary mortal seeking to move a mountain; there was no way for
him to budge the corpse in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This thing is dead;
perhaps its core regions are damaged as well. Last time I encountered
one of these things, my Northbow swords were able to drink from the
golden sand to evolve. This corpse might have a similar effect on my
swords.” This was the thought that flashed through Ning’s mind…
but a heartbeat later, he understood that with the three clan leaders
present, there was simply no way he’d be able to slowly upgrade his
Northbow swords and let them feed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I have a better
opportunity, I should come back and explore the insides of this
corpse.” Ning continued his advance, leaving it behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, palatial
ruins must have had many living creatures within it in the past, but
all of that was gone now. Ning wasn’t sure as to how many corpses
had been destroyed and how many had been carted off by the three
great clans. Perhaps the only immovable one was this onyx humanoid
corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending half a
day, Ning finally reached the core regions of this enormous palace
complex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… a surge of
unkwown power was flowing through this place. It completely blocked
off Ning’s secret arts and heartworld projection, making it
impossible for them to spread out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning could
vaguely see a few golems flickering around in front of him. Clearly,
they had retreated into this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Emperor-class
golems are all here?” Ning stared at the unknown power flowing
through this area. He could sense, however, that the power was quite
weak. He stared off into the distance, where a series of enormous
pillars could be seen generating waves of power that fed this unknown
energy. Many of the pillars had toppled or been destroyed, and many
more were damaged as well. Only a tiny fraction were undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are of no
threat to me. They shouldn’t be able to harm me.” After testing
things out, Ning stepped straight into the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three clan leaders
exchanged a glance, then followed Ning in. They didn’t even attack
Ning, just followed him from behind. As for Ning, he ignored them.
There was no point in fighting them, as he was always on the
defensive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Darknorth is quite a cautious man.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the caution in
the world won’t do a damn thing for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’ll be dying
soon enough.” The three clan leaders continued to plot against
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning himself, he
carefully inspected the surrounding area. From the looks of it, this
was once an enormous Sithe palace complex! The residences of the
highest-ranking members should’ve been in the centermost area, and
that was where the defenses should’ve been tightest. Only,
everything along the way had been destroyed by that claw-attacking
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning reached the
very center of this palace complex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning stared off into the distance, through a number of shattered
walls. He was able to see a hill-sized onyx humanoid corpse lying
slumped on the ground… in fact, Ning saw a total of three of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three more onyx
humanoid corpses?” Ning was awestruck. This place was definitely an
extremely important place for the Sithe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly… swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh!!! Four figures suddenly flew towards him at high
speed from afar. Each of the four moved faster than a hundred times
the speed of light, causing Ning to turn pale! It must be remembered
that the three clan leaders themselves merely moved at a hundred
times the speed of light. Ning himself had yet to breach this limit!
Even amongst Eternal Emperors, moving faster than a hundred times the
speed of light was incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the four
figures attacking Ning had each surpassed this limit. Ning
immediately sensed his subconscious screaming at him about the danger
he was in. He understood that these four figures were far more
powerful than the three clan leaders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any outsiders who
barge into Sithe lands shall be slain without exception!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you,
help us stop this intruder!” The four figures called out commands
as they flew towards Ning at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, milords!” the
three silver men called back. They had become members of the Sithe
race after undergoing the Ritual Sacrificium and thus had been
acknowledged by the Sithe; this was why they weren’t attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” One of the
figures was completely gray in color, and he wielded a short spear in
his hands. Swirls of gray light manifested at the tip of the spear as
he arched his entire body backwards, then threw it forwards
furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The short spear
shot through the air, moving far faster than the four figures
themselves and carrying a terrifying level of power within it as it
shot straight towards Ning. Ning instantly understood that if he
allowed himself to be surrounded by these foes, he would definitely
die.

Chapter 24 - Invitation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s our
chance.” The three clan leaders had been following Ji Ning this
entire time, never letting him get too far away from them. Now, they
all excitedly charged straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slow him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can tie him
down for a short period of time, he’ll be doomed.” The three clan
leaders were filled with confidence, because it was quite easy for
them to tie down Daolord Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The short spear
had already arrived in front of Ning. Ning produced a golden gem in
his hand. The golden gem had strands of golden silk within it. He
instantly crushed it, causing a wave of awesome power to spread out
and cover his entire body as it was surrounded by layers of silken
gold light. This was one of Ning’s life-preserving treasures, and
it was designed to allow one’s speed to skyrocket!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The skinny
silver man shot straight towards Ning with his sharp spike in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning moved in a
ghostly manner, instantly skyrocketing beyond a hundred times the
speed of light and only leaving a golden streak of light behind him.
He was simply too fast! With the treasure supporting him, he was able
to move even faster than the Radiant King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short spear still
arrived in front of Ning; it had actually been able to change
direction mid-flight. Clang! Ning didn’t dare to take it lightly.
He used all six Northbow swords to block simultaneously, only to
sense a powerful surge of might transmit to him from the strike. Ning
couldn’t help but stumble a few steps backwards as he hurriedly
retreated, transforming into a streak of golden lightning that fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the short spear,
the collision knocked it to one side. It went flying straight towards
the Fumo clan leader, forcing the muscular silver man to hurriedly
dodge to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let him
escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slow him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
fast?” Although the three clan leaders were extremely anxious, they
could do nothing but watch as Ning transformed into an
incomprehensibly fast speed of golden light that seemed to be even
faster than the four figures chasing behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning pulled
farther and farther away as he flew off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually
escaped.” The three clan leaders exchanged glances, feeling
anxious, angry, and helpless. They knew that given their own speed,
they stood no chance of catching Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
The four figures flew towards them and came to a halt, watching with
ugly looks on their faces as Ning fled off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You three useless
pieces of trash.” One of the figures glanced disdainfully at the
three clan leaders. “You couldn’t even handle such a simple task.
If you were able to slow him down for just a few seconds, we would’ve
been able to surround and kill him for sure! Hmph. Any of the Silver
Daolords of the old, true Sithe were far more powerful than you. You
are the weakest Silver Daolords we brothers have ever encountered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not just every Sithe
was permitted to become a Silver Daolord. One had to first reach the
supreme Daolord level. Given Sithe training methods, they
proportionally had far more supreme Daolords than the cultivators.
The three clan leaders’ weakness was their low level of
understanding of the Dao. If they were at the supreme Daolord level,
Ning would’ve been finished long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three clan leaders
smiled ingratiatingly and didn’t argue, but in their hearts they
secretly grumbled. These four were nothing more than golems. By what
right did they act so arrogantly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. These four
figures were all Emperor-class golems, but they were noticeably much
more powerful than the others. Every single one of them was on par
with a lord of the Sacred Cities! Although Ning had just barely
reached that level as well, he was still lacking in many respects; if
he was to actually fight against a real lord of a Sacred City, he
would be completely dominated. These four golems, however, were each
capable of fighting a Sacred City lord to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four seniors,
Daolord Darknorth has barged into our forbidden grounds and should be
killed,” the silver-haired man said. “We should hunt him down and
kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our responsibility
is to watch over and guard this forbidden region. Since he has
already escaped and left this region, we naturally will not pursue
him any further. If you wish to do so, that is your business.” The
four figures glanced coldly at the three clan leaders, then turned
and flew away. They truly did look down upon these three clan
leaders. Although they were members of the Sithe thanks to having
undergone the Ritual Sacrificium, they were really far too weak when
compared to true Sithe experts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those four idiots.”
The three clan leaders ground their teeth in rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are nothing
more than golems. They shall forever do nothing more than obey the
orders of the Sithe race. This area has clearly been completely
destroyed, but they continue to guard it and regard it as a
restricted area. Why bother getting angry with golems?” The three
clan leaders turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperor-class
golems they had caught in recent years were all fairly weak ones that
were comparable to supreme Daolords. They wouldn’t dare to even
fight against the four strongest golems, much less capture them and
bind them by force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the speed
boost provided by the treasure, Ning quickly outstripped his
pursuers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, they actually
didn’t chase?” After fleeing quite a distance, Ning turned to see
the four figures chatting with the three clan leaders, followed by
the four figures returning to the core areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from what I
saw, those four figures should’ve been golems.” Ning nodded.
“Golems actually managed to become this powerful… the Sithe’s
mastery over golems far surpassed ours.” Based on the golems the
six powers in the Endless Territories had acquired, it seemed as
though there were different levels of power amongst Emperor-class
golems. The ones he had fought had all been weak, while this time he
had finally stumbled across strong ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already found
four of those onyx humanoid corpses here. These things held an
advantage over Hegemons in single combat!” Ning sighed with
amazement. “Even Crimsonwave Temple merely had two of these Hegemon
overseers protecting it, but I count four dead ones here already!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That means this
place is probably even more important than Crimsonwave Temple!”
Ning was intrigued. Given how much combat power had been focused on
this place by the Sithe, it probably held treasures which were far
more valuable than the treasures inside Crimsonwave Temple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… this
place seems to have been wrecked by that claw-attacker. He butchered
countless Sithe and probably took away the most valuable treasures,”
Ning mused privately. “I hope he left a few things behind.” He
didn’t even consider the possibility that the claw-attacker had
died, as anyone capable of easily ripping those onyx humanoids in
half had reached a level of power that was far beyond his
imagination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hegemons definitely
weren’t capable of thus. Then… Otherverse Lords, perhaps? Or
even… the legendary Autarchs?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The three
clan leaders flew towards Ning from afar. “Those three fellows have
come to cause trouble again.” Ning frowned, then began to dart
forwards while maintaining as much distance from the three clan
leaders as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While flying, Ning
continuously scanned through the towering palace ruins around him. He
didn’t dare to fly about randomly, for fear of accidentally
activating some traps or mechanisms the Sithe had left behind. Thus,
the three clan leaders were able to quickly catch up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave them a
sidelongs glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Count yourself lucky
for having escaped that,” the muscular silver man said with a cold
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You survived once,
but you won’t survive every time. I urge you to leave our ancestral
grounds immediately. Otherwise, you’ll probably die here. The Sithe
left behind many terrifying barriers and guardians. Although the vast
majority were ruined and only a few survived, any of them would be
enough to claim your puny life. Leave the ancestral grounds and live
for a bit longer,” the skinny silver man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
them. He might not be able to beat them, but they weren’t able to
do anything to him either. “I just need to stay careful at all
times. Can’t give them any opportunities.” Ning carefully
scrutinized his surroundings, visualizing how the palace ruins
must’ve looked in the past and thus predicting where certain
treasures might lay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from the
layout, there should’ve been a secondary nexus over there.” Ning
continued his search, quickly discovering a bestial stone statue
within a pile of rubble. This stone statue looked rather similar to a
three-headed lion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? The style of
this statue seems rather different from that of the Sithe buildings.”
Ning was puzzled. He stared carefully and cautiously at the stone
statue as he slowly moved towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. The central
head of the three-headed lion statue suddenly opened its mouth. Its
mouth seemed to be filled with an infinite universe in it, and an
awe-inspiring amount of power suddenly swept out from the lion’s
mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A terrifying
sucking power was applied to Ning, who was shocked to find that he
couldn’t resist it at all. He felt like an ordinary mortal who had
been trapped in an ocean whirlpool as he was drawn inexorably into
the lion’s mouth. Ning shrank in size as he was drawn in closer and
closer before finally becoming ant-sized as he entered the lion’s
mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He went inside.”
The three clan leaders who had been following Ning were shocked, and
they hurriedly went over to inspect the lion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such incredible
power. There has to be a major treasure inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe left many
hidden rooms with countless treasures. This place has to be one of
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
didn’t seem to be attacked; it looks as though he’s just flying
deeper inside.” They could clearly see from outside the lion’s
mouth how Ning was continuously flying deeper and deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t let
Daolord Darknorth acquire those treasures. He’s already incredibly
powerful; if he acquires even better treasures, we’re going to be
doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re the Sithe!
Sithe treasures belong to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let us go
inside.” The three hesitated for a while outside before
transforming into streaks of light that flew towards the lion. They
did this partially because they naturally felt the need to prevent
Ning from acquiring any more treasures, and partially because they
didn’t really worry about danger. They were Sithe! Even if they
entered some incredibly important restricted areas, they would at
most be unceremoniously kicked out. Over the course of all these
years, not a single clan leader had perished within the ancestral
grounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?” Ning
stared at the rainbow region around him. The aura emanating from this
region was incredibly exalted, and the power flowed everywhere.
Clearly, this truly was an exceptional place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
suddenly tightened as he glanced backwards. “They came inside as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three silver men
flew over, excited looks on their faces. As soon as they sensed the
aura and power held within this region, they understood that this was
an extraordinary place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
all thanks to you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
you, we never would’ve discovered this place.” The three clan
leaders were quite smug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment, a
humanoid figure suddenly coalesced in the center of this bright
ranbow region. This figure was dressed in long black robes, was
pale-faced, had blood-red eyes, and looked both handsome and evil. He
stared at the three clan leaders, an icy look on his face as his
voice boomed out, shaking the entire world: “I invited this
cultivator to come in, but how dare you three Sithe barge in as well!
Do you think you are worthy of entering an Autarch’s territory?
Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Suddenly, a
ripple of spatial power swept across the three silver men. They
instantly turned pale, but before they could so much as say a word
their bodies were split in half at the waist. A heartbeat later,
their eyes turned dull as they perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six parts of the
three silver men’s corpses just hung there in midair.

Chapter 25 - Autarch Bolin
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was rather
stunned when he saw this. Those three silver men had been incredibly
strong… how had they been so easily slain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, when he thought
of the three words ‘an Autarch’s territory’ he began to
understand. Anything that had even the most tenuous of connections to
an Autarch was guaranteed to be extraordinary. Autarchs were the most
supreme leaders of the entire cultivator civilization! They were even
able to create those alternate universes which Eternal Emperors
fought over like rabid dogs, seeking to take control over them and
become Otherverse Lords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those otherverses were
nothing more than constructs devised by the Autarchs. This was a
testament to how mighty the Autarchs were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
stared at the wicked black-robed figure. He couldn’t help but ask,
“This place is an Autarch’s territory? Are you saying that one of
the legendary Autarchs set this place up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct.” The
black-robed man revealed a hint of a smile as a flicker of pride
appeared in his eyes. “My master was named Bolin. The countless
cultivators of the Chaosverse reverentially refer to him as Autarch
Bolin. Aside from the few other Autarchs who stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with him, there is no one in all the Chaosverse
who is his equal. Young fellow, you are currently just a Daolord; you
can’t even imagine just how powerful an Autarch is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
benevolent intentions radiating from this man. In truth, when he
heard the words ‘I invited this cultivator to come in’ Ning
immediately realized that this person was a friend, not a foe. Given
how he was able to annihilate the three clan leaders with ease, there
was no need for him to deceive Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but ask, “Senior, are Autarchs capable of reversing the flows of
spacetime within a chaosworld to revive a Celestial Immortal whose
truesoul was destroyed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! Forget
about Celestial Immortals, even World-level cultivators can be
rescued if the Autarch was willing.” The black-robed man shook his
head. “However, being ‘able’ to do so is one thing; being
‘willing’ to do so is another. Reversing spacetime to revive
someone will cause the Autarch to endure a backlash from the prime
essences of the entire Chaosverse. Not even an Autarch would suffer
something like this lightly. You would have to pay a high price, a
price which would sway even an Autarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me,” the
black-robed man instructed. He glanced sideways at the corpses of the
three silver men. “Right, go ahead and collect those corpses. They
probably have a few treasures on them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
waved his hand, collecting all three corpses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Instead of being
actual cultivators, they chose to undergo the Ritual Sacrificium and
serve as the pawns of the Sithe.” The black-robed man shook his
head. “And the most unsightly Sithe pawns I’ve ever seen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most unsightly?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
nodded. “True Sithe are extremely powerful! Generally speaking, the
stronger a Sithe is, the more unwilling he is to undergo the Ritual
Sacrificium. Although the ritual will allow them to rapidly increase
in strength within a short period of time, they lose all hope of
making any further breakthroughs. This is why strong Sithe disdain
such an act.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for these three
fools? They can’t even compare to real Silver Daolords in power,
while Silver Daolords represented the most common footsoldiers in the
Sithe army. During that great war, Hegemons served as the mainstays
in each army! Long ago, our five Autarchs united the forces of all
cultivators in the entire Chaosverse to fight that great war. The
Autarchs served as the vanguard, the edge of the blade that tore
through all of the important Sithe locations,” the black-robed man
said. “For example, this entire thing was once a Sithe warship.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Warship?” Ning had
never imagined that the ‘Stone Hellephant Wall’ was actually a
warship!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, I suppose it
would be more appropriate to describe it as a terrifying
war-fortress! It was capable of easily tearing through spacetime and
going from realmverse to realmverse. This warship was so powerful
that it was able to slay Hegemons in the blink of an eye,” the
black-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even a squad of
ten Hegemons working together were able to fight this thing to a
standstill. Thus, when my master discovered this thing he continued
to pursue it without pause. It fled at high speed, tearing through
spacetime repeatedly as it tried to escape, but my master was able to
enter it and then slaughter a path through it. He ruined this entire
warship, slaying more than thirty thousand Sithe and destroying all
of the golems. He destroyed everything, leaving nothing behind!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was breathless
upon hearing this. So this was how powerful an Autarch was?! “All
the golems were destroyed?” Ning was puzzled. “But I still saw
plenty of Emperor-class golems outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To my master, those
golems posed no conceivable threat at all. He let out a casual
strike, destroying all the golems and then immediately departing this
place. He had to hurry off to a different battlefield and continue
the war against the Sithe,” the black-robed man said. “In truth,
however, these Sithe golems all possessed self-repair mechanisms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They looked like
they had been destroyed, but some were able to regenerate. As more
time passed, some slowly were able to rebuild themselves. Some
actually scavenged for parts from other golems that had been
destroyed. Thus, a fraction of the golems are still alive, but they
pose no real danger at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
‘No real danger at all’? He had been forced to flee in pathetic
fashion by those four Emperor-class golems which were comparable to
the eight lords of the Sacred Cities. Still, it made sense; to
Autarch Bolin, those creatures were nothing more than ants. Any
Hegemon would’ve been able to destroy them with ease. They really
didn’t pose any danger to the cultivator civilization in general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,” the
black-robed man instructed as he flew forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
followed from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the three great
clans were in a state of utter panic. Although they had been
extremely stunned by the deaths of so many Daolords, they still felt
fairly calm because they knew that the Silver Daolords were the true
foundation of power for them! Every single clan leader was able to
inherit the legacy of a Silver Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The clan leaders
died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could they have
died? How could the clan leaders have died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. No clan
leader has ever been killed since the establishment of the three
great clans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all
completely dumbfounded. The three great clans didn’t even know what
they should do next, because they had never encountered a situation
like this since they had been created. Clan leaders always died when
their lifespans came to an end! None had ever been killed. Now that
they had been killed, the ‘Silver Daolord’ legacy had clearly
been lost as well. How would they be able to protect themselves
without any Silver Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?
The entire Fumo clan only has a single Daolord left!” They were all
utterly terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go to the ancestral
grounds! Go now and seize back the Silver Daolord legacy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot! Seize it?
Seize it how?! All three clan leaders were slain; if I went, I would
be instantly annihilated by Daolord Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t afford
any further losses at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone… the
three great clans have been defeated. Defeated! The only thing we can
do is protect our clan as best we can, using the Sithe disks and the
many barriers left behind by our ancestors! So long as Daolord
Darknorth can’t breach our barriers, he won’t be able to enter.
All we can do is delay as long as we can. Once Daolord Darknorth
lifespan comes to an end and he dies, we’ll use our Emperor-class
golems to rise to power once more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, delaying is all
we can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
simultaneously came to this same decision. Right now, they each only
had one or two Daolords left. It must be remembered that only
Daolords were capable of syncing with the Sithe disks that maintained
the clan barriers. Once the clans lost their Daolords, they would be
completely doomed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
flew into the sky, leading Ning behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During that great
war, the Autarchs made contingency plans in the event of defeat,”
the black-robed man said. “If they were defeated, we would need to
be able to raise a new ‘crop’ of experts who would continue the
struggle against the Sithe. Thus, my master Autarch Bolin set up many
beastworlds. He put estate-worlds in every single beast statue, and
the Daos he put into them were Daos which could lead to Autarchy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lead towards
Autarchy?” Ning’s heart trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t get too
excited. It only ‘leads’ towards Autarchy, but actually reaching
the Autarch level is far too difficult.” The black-robed man
laughed. “Although the Sithe were extremely powerful as a group,
they didn’t have any individuals who could match our Autarchs in
power, which was why they were defeated in the end. Autarchs are just
too powerful. Just look at this warship! It was incredibly powerful,
but it was viewed as nothing more but a plaything by the Autarchs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
only Eternal Emperors are qualified to enter these beastworlds. I
generally have no interest in Daolords at all, and they aren’t
qualified to enter.” The black-robed man smiled. “But just now, I
noticed that you were actually able to battle those three pathetic
Silver Daolords to a standstill. I was quite surprised by this. You
were just a Daolord, after all, and I can tell that you aren’t
wielding a Universe treasure. For you to be able to unleash such
might is quite rare indeed, which was why I permitted you to enter. I
hope you will not disappoint me.”

Chapter 26 - Daobirth
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.” The
black-robed man pointed off into the distance. Ji Ning followed his
gaze, only to see a Daoist altar hanging in the air with nine pillars
above it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How odd. This region
is enormous, but it is completely empty. This Daoist altar is the
only thing here.” Ning was rather puzzled, but he still followed
the black-robed man as they flew towards the altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. As soon as they
landed atop the altar, Ning immediately smelled a certain fragrance
pervade his nostrils. His mind grew sharper, and even his thinking
speed began to quickly skyrocket. This was a marvelous effect that
seemed quite similar to the Stone Censer of Reunion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This altar has the
effect of helping you focus your mind and meditate on the Dao,” the
black-robed man said. “An Autarch’s Dao is unfathomably profound
and mysterious, after all. It would be extremely difficult for
Eternal Emperors to even memorize it without help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit here in the
lotus position within the center of that circle.” The black-robed
man pointed towards a circle that was roughly nine meters in
diameter. “Sit in the lotus position there and view the surrounding
area. There you shall find the Autarch’s Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, senior.” Ning
felt his heartrate speed up. There were very, very few things which
could make him feel so nervous and so eager. He walked into the
circle, sat down in the lotus position, then stared at his
surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
pale. The vast region around him, which had formerly been empty and
devoid of all things, suddenly began to manifest traces and vestiges
of a Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A fiery red bird
suddenly appeared in the empty void in front of him, spreading its
wings and soaring towards the skies. Its Dao was vast and
awe-inspiring, burning through all things and reducing them to ash.
Nothing could withstand such a thing! This was a physical
manifestation of a Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, Ning had
once seen something similar when he had seen Daolord Windsource’s
‘Hundred Streams of the Windsource’. Compared to this firebird
manifestation of the Dao, however, it was unfathomably punier. If the
visualization of the ‘Hundred Streams of the Windsource’ was like
a stream, then the fiery bird was like an endlessly vast sea!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning turned his head slightly to glance towards a different
direction. There he saw a pitch-black long saber that was extremely
thin and sharp. The blade was aimed towards the heavens, and the
saber was so vast that it was on par with that giant fiery bird. Its
power was stately and reserved, but the edge of the blade seemed to
be brimming with explosive power. This was a Saber Dao which inspired
utter terror in Ning, a Dao that was just as capable of annihilating
all in its path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sword Dao?”
Next to the ‘Saber Dao’ hanging in the air, Ning also saw a
similarly massive sword. This was a strange rapier-like sword that
had had no blade at all, just an incredibly sharp tip. This rapier
was massive and also pointed straight towards the heavens. This was a
Sword Dao that focused on one aspect of the sword to the extreme.
Given Ning’s mastery of the Dao of the Sword, he was immediately
able to recognize that this ‘Rapier Dao’ was a path that
represented the fusion of his Blood Drop stance and his Soleheart
stance, and in both the wielder had completely eclipsed Ning’s
current level of mastery. It represented an absolutely incomparable
level of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A giant flaming bird, a
long black saber, a rapier, a black mist, a feather, a blood-colored
stream, a golden sun, a vast gray sky, a dazzling rainbow… these
were the nine manifestations of the Daos that appeared in the vast
void. All of these Daos were on par with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Ning
raised his head to stare towards the skies above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the heavens above
him, he saw an incomparably massive hand. The fingers on this hand
were extremely slender, while the fingernails were extremely sharp.
The hand was formed into a claw-stance! This great claw was filled
with an incomparably exalted and absolutely tyrannical aura that
filled the heavens themselves. Ning could feel his very truesoul
shuddering when he simply looked at the thing. Compared to that
single massive hand, the other nine Daos were unfathomably weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If those nine great
Daos were like vast oceans, then that great hand was like the
countless stars of the cosmos themselves. It truly was
incomprehensibly more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you understand
now?” The black-robed man spoke out when he saw Ning raise his head
upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” Ning
suppressed the excitement he felt and halted his viewings. These Dao
manifestations were of tremendous benefit to him. “However, this
junior can tell that Autarch Bolin’s claw-arts were so powerful as
to be completely unfathomable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ehehe.” The
black-robed man laughed, “Long ago, my master Autarch Bolin relied
on his claw-arts to become a Hegemon! However, he remained trapped at
the Hegemon level for many years, unable to make a breakthrough, and
so he began to meditate on other Daos as well. The Dao of Space, the
Dao of Time, the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of the Saber, the Dao of
Darkness… he mastered nine Daos in total on his own, reaching the
Hegemon level in all of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was awestruck upon
hearing this. To be able to reach the Hegemon level in a single Dao
was already terrifyingly impressive. Autarch Bolin had done that for
nine other Daos as well?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All Daos are linked;
the more Daos he mastered, the deeper Master’s insights into the
Dao of the Claw grew. Finally, all of those insights burst forth like
water crashing through a shattered dam, and my master reached the
Daobirth level, the level where ‘one Dao births many Daos’. He
became an Autarch,” the black-robed man explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One Dao births many
Daos?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal Emperors
must gain eternal Daos for themselves. As for Autarchs, they must
reach the level where ‘one Dao births many Daos’, what we call
the ‘Daobirth’ level,” the black-robed man explained. “At the
apex, all Daos are linked together, which is why once you reach the
Autarch level you will naturally gain insight into many Daos you had
never even trained in before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master, for
example, managed to reach the ‘Daobirth’ level through his Dao of
the Claw. He established an alternate universe with the Dao of the
Claw as its original prime essence, which then unfolded through the
form of countless other Daos,” the black-robed man explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
How incredible. Did this mean that once he reached the apex of his
Omega Sword Dao, it would be able to give birth to many other Daos,
such as the Daos of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, spacetime,
darkness, and light? The mere thought of it stunned him. How strong
would his Omega Sword Dao have to become, for it to naturally give
birth to countless other Daos?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To go from the
Hegemon level to the Autarch level is far, far too difficult,” the
black-robed figure said. “Enough. I’ve already told you
everything you need to know. Calm your mind and go back to your
viewings. Memorize all of this as quickly as you can. That way, even
after you leave this place you can still meditate on what you have
seen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. He did indeed have to memorize all of this, but doing so
would be extremely difficult. The Dao of an Autarch was truly
inconceivable; just memorizing its appearance was as difficult as
asking an ordinary mortal to memorize a language with hundreds of
millions of characters. Still, Ning understood that he had to
memorize it despite its difficulty, because he couldn’t stay here
for the rest of his life. Only by memorizing it would he be able to
train in it whenever he wished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
couldn’t help but add, “This junior does have a request.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A request?” The
black-robed man was puzzled. “Go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior has an
extremely good friend who is also a supreme Daolord. Can he come out
and view this Dao and be guided by it as well?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Dao might not be
of tremendous use to him in meditating on the Dao, but there was
another aspect to it. The path of a cultivation was an extremely long
one, and there were many hidden pitfalls and problems which
cultivators could fall into. This Dao would serve as a lamp post
which would illuminate the path to Autarchy, resolving the questions
cultivators would have. Ning and Ninedust were lifelong friends; he
naturally wanted to help Ninedust out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A supreme Daolord?”
The black-robed man chuckled. “Listen, kid… I already told you
that I really don’t have any interest in Daolords at all. I’m
generally only interested in particularly powerful Eternal Emperors!
You, however, are far stronger than other supreme Daolords despite
not even having a Universe treasure. This is why I’ve given you a
special chance. As for ‘ordinary’ supreme Daolords, they can
forget about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about it?”
Ning was rather anxious but he didn’t know what to say to persuade
the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that I’m
stingy.” The black-robed man shook his head. “The greatest
barrier any and all cultivators shall face is the Daomerge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To advance from
Hegemony to Autarchy is perhaps just as difficult as the Daomerge,
but at least there isn’t a danger of dying,” the black-robed man
said. “But the Daomerge is not only difficult, it is also fatal
when failed. If you fail, you are destined to die and your Dao shall
vanish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus… the
cultivator civilization as a whole doesn’t care that much about
Daolords. New crops of Daolords arise in every generation, with the
previous crop of Daolords having perished. Far, far too few supreme
Daolords are able to skyrocket to the Hegemon level of power,” the
black-robed man said. “Thus, it really isn’t worth us wasting too
much time or energy on supreme Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. He
had to admit that the man made sense. To this very day, the Endless
Territories only had three Hegemons! One could already imagine how
this current crop of supreme Daolords, including Winesage, Dawnstar,
the Radiant King, and even Ning himself would eventually perish. For
even one Hegemon to emerge from their ranks would be a stroke of
incredible luck. The most likely outcome was that all of them would
fail and all of them would die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, however, are a
bit special. If you really do succeed in the Daomerge, you will
definitely be more powerful than most Hegemons,” the black-robed
man said. “That’s the only reason why I’m giving you a chance.
There’s no need for me to waste my time on other ‘supreme’
Daolords.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All things and all
beings are given a chance,” Ji Ning couldn’t help but rebut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
paused slightly. These words had indeed moved him, as they were a
bedrock of faith which all cultivators believed in. There were no
absolutes in the world; there was always a chance, no matter how
slim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! What you say
makes sense.” Intrigued, the black-robed man turned to grin at
Ning. “Then I’ll give that friend of yours a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly?” Ning was
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All he has to do is
capture an Emperor-class golem without relying on any outside sources
of help or a Universe treasure If he can do that, I’ll let him
meditate here,” the black-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned upon
hearing this. Capture an Emperor-class golem? All of the golems
within these Sithe ruins were at least at the supreme Daolord level.
It would be incredibly hard for the Ninedust Sectlord to capture one
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There lies his
chance and his opportunity,” the black-robed man said. “I’ve
given him the chance. If he can seize it, I’ll give him the
opportunity to train here. If he cannot… then there’s nothing for
it. I really have no interest in ordinary, unremarkable Daolords at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. Thank
you, senior.” Ning didn’t dare to press his luck. He immediately
said, “My friend is within my personal estate-treasure. Should I…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send you out.
Make some arrangements for your friend, them re-enter,” the
black-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged,”
Ning assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
waved his sleeves. Whoosh. Ning immediately was sent flying backwards
as space twisted around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ant-sized Ning came
flying out from the mouth of that stone lion statue, regaining his
normal size once he exited. The lion’s mouth, however, remained
open. He would be able to re-enter whenever he chosen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, allowing Ninedust to come out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go,
Darknorth?” Ninedust immediately queried Ning upon exiting,
scanning the surrounding area as he did so. He was instantly stunned
by what he saw. “What is this place? What’s with the rubble?
Wait, I see a few statues over there; they seem absolutely
incredible! Is this the secret place you were talking about? Why
isn’t there anyone around here? Where are the three clan leaders?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm down and
relax,” Ning said. “One question at a time. Listen to me
explain.” Ning started to narrate the situation from the beginning,
even telling Ninedust everything about the Autarch’s territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The senior has said
that if you can capture an Emperor-class golem by yourself without
needing to resort to a Universe treasure or outside sources of power,
he’ll let you train as well.” Ning said helplessly, “That’s
the only way he’ll let you in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarch? One Dao
births many Daos? Just thinking about it is inconceivable.”
Ninedust said excitedly, “Haha, I was wondering who would be
incredible enough to cause this sort of damage. So it was an Autarch
who ruined this place! Thank you so much, Darknorth; helping me get
this slim chance was already a blessing. I’ll do my absolute best.
Given my current level of power, I should still have a chance to
capture one of those Emperor-class golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. Still, he knew that Ninedust was significantly weaker than
any of the three clan leaders had been! The three clan leaders were
generally able to capture Emperor-class golems in solo fights. Still,
Ninedust did have advantages of his own. His Dao was far more
profound than theirs had been; their attacks were extremely clumsy
and straightforward. Ning was merely on par with the three clan
leaders, but he had been able to easily capture three Emperor-class
golems when surrounded by six. This was precisely because Ning vastly
outstripped those golems in both power and insight into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead. Don’t
worry about me. Haha, now that the three clan leaders have died,
there’s no one capable of threatening me,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember, don’t
get too close to the core regions,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. You
have escape-type treasures, so do I.” Ninedust smirked. “And I
won’t go too far; I only need to find one of the ordinary
Emperor-class golems, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You have to
be careful.” After speaking, Ning walked towards the mouth of that
stone lion. As he did, his body shrank in size before being drawn
into the lion’s mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, kid. Your
friend won you a chance to earn yourself a shot at entering this
place. The rest is up to you. Let’s see if you are able to capture
an Emperor-class golem. The most talented of supreme Daolords are
generally capable of this.” A rumbling voice rang out from the
lion’s mouth. Moments later, the lion’s mouth shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust immediately
said respectfully, “Yes, senior.” His eyes gleamed with light. He
knew that this person’s words were correct; extremely talented
first-tier Daolords all were capable of succeeding in this task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Radiant King, for
example, would be able to rely on his overwhelming superiority in
speed to capture an Emperor-class golem, while Palace Lord Dawnstar
would be able to use his raw power. “I’ll be able to do it as
well.” Ninedust immediately began to search for those Emperor-class
golems who were in hiding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust remained
outside, beginning his hunt for an Emperor-class golem. As for Ning,
after entering the beastworld he began to once more view the
Autarch’s Daos. Ning only had a shot at memorizing these Daos
because of the incredible effects of the altar, and so he had to
remain inside of it. If he was anywhere else, these Daos would
completely eclipse the bounds of Ning’s memorization abilities.
Thus, Ning didn’t use any temporal acceleration treasure; if he
entered his cottage, he would be unable to make full use of the
effects of the altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How absolutely
incredible. Nine incredible Daos and that awesome Dao of the Claw. As
a Hegemon, Autarch Bolin was able to master a total of ten Daos to
the Hegemon level. No wonder he was able to become an Autarch in the
end.” The more Ning learned and memorized, the more awe he felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘impressions’
of the ten Daos began to grow clearer and clearer within his
memories. What he needed to do was to perfectly engrave all of them
into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. During
the very first year, Ning was able to fully memorize the Dao of the
Sword. In fact, because the Sword Dao which Autarch Bolin had devised
felt similar to a fusion of the Blood Drop stance and the Soleheart
stance, the memorization process caused Ning to accidentally break
through to the fourth stage with his Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was primarily
because his Blood Drop stance had already made incredible gains in
Crimsonwave Temple, more gains than any of the rest of the five
stances of his Omega Sword Dao. In this place, the influence of the
Autarch’s Daos and Sword Dao resulted in Ning shooting to the
fourth stage almost immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another thirty
years, Ning finished memorizing the other eight Daos as well. With
that, all nine of the Hegemon-level Daos had been memorized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
look upwards, finally beginning to stare at the vast claw-stanced
hand which hung in the heavens above him. This hand seemed to blot
out the skies themselves and were as vast and endless as the cosmos.
It was supremely exalted, a Dao which birthed many other Daos. Just
staring at the palm and the Dao of the Claw, Ning was able to vaguely
make out a quietly gurgling stream of water, a roaring blaze of fire,
saber-light and sword-shadows, as well as the threads of karma…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daobirth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core of it remained
the Dao of the Claw… but actually memorizing it was incredibly
difficult for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When meditating on the
Dao, one would not notice the passage of time. Ning was completely
absorbed in silently meditating on the enormous claw-hand which hung
in the skies above him. He continuously memorized everything he saw,
not stopping for a single instant as he borrowed from the power of
the altar. Not just him; even his Primaltwin and his avatar were
completely focused on the memorization process. The Primaltwin used
the Stone Censer of Reunion and thus was able to memorize at 30% the
speed of his true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, this altar was
purpose-designed and thus was incredibly effective in helping one
memorize things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
sat there within the levitating altar, those nine stone pillars
slowly revolving around him. The passage of years hadn’t left the
slightest of marks behind on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished
memorizing it.” Ning opened his eyes. Within his mind appeared
perfectly clear images of the nine Hegemon-level Daos and the awesome
Autarch-level Dao of the Claw. Their forms had been fully engraved
into his mind… but of course, this was just their form alone. Thus,
they could only serve as guideposts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this was
already enough. Ning knew that every cultivator had a different path
to follow; to have guideposts was sufficient. If he tried to force
himself to master the Autarch’s Dao, it would probably actually
hinder his own path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha… just 120
million years. Your comprehension abilities aren’t bad. You managed
to memorize it quite quickly.” The black-robed man suddenly
appeared next to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust…?” Ning
glanced around, only to find that he was still alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your friend? He’s
still outside battling against those Emperor-class golems. He looks
as though he’s improved quite a bit; a few more breakthroughs and
he might actually be able to capture one of them.” The black-robed
man smiled. “Darknorth, per my master’s instructions, every
single person who came in here to meditate will be given a treasure
based on how well they performed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bestowed a
treasure?” Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master, Autarch
Bolin, did this because he was worried about being defeated. As a
result, he spared no expense in arranging for later generations of
cultivators to rise to power,” the black-robed man said. “Go
ahead into the outside world and battle against those golems the
Sithe left behind. Let me see how strong you have grown. The better
your performance is, the better a treasure I will give you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to feel
rather excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. Show me just how
powerful a ‘mere’ Daolord can become,” the black-robed man said
quite eagerly. After a person forcibly memorized the physical
manifestation of an Autarch’s Dao, he would be able to rapidly make
actual use of those insights in combat. After 120 million years of
memorization, it was time for an explosive period of growth in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… as the
black-robed man saw it, given how strong Daolord Darknorth was, the
man was most likely extremely close to his lifespan limit. He
probably wouldn’t have grown all that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll definitely do
my absolute best,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black-robed
man waved his arm, causing a spatial ripple to surround Ning and
deliver him out of this beastworld and into the Sithe ruins outside.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace ruins
stretched far off into the horizon. There seemed to be no end to
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than thirty
thousand true Sithe once lived here.” Ji Ning stared at the ruins,
rather moved. “I really wonder how different the Sithe civilization
was from our cultivator civilization.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” A
delight cry rang out from far away as a streak of light quickly shot
towards Ning and descended. It was Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You finally came
out. I’ve been fighting like an idiot for millions of years, all by
myself,” Ninedust said with an overjoyed look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really
disappoint me. All this time, and you haven’t caught a single
Emperor-class golem?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, don’t blame
me for that. I managed to make some improvements after inspecting
those claw-marks left behind in the palace ruins, but…” Ninedust
said anxiously, “But there are more than a hundred of those
Emperor-class golems, and they all hide behind the remaining barriers
set up by the Sithe. There’s no way for me to force them out at
all. My only choice is to wait for a chance. One time, I damn near
caught one of those things, but the other golems jumped into help the
first one out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
The golems weren’t so foolish as to fight in solo combat! When the
situation turned grim for one of them, the others would step in to
help out! This was why the three great clans had labored for so long
to capture Emperor-class golems, and yet only had a few in each clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have an idea.”
Ning mentally transmitted his suggestion to Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust’s eyes lit
up when he heard this. “Haha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the only
real thing I can do. If you STILL cannot capture an Emperor-class
golem, there’s nothing else I can do,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Ninedust suddenly thought of something. He said hurriedly, “Oh,
right. I almost forgot! I’ve been battling in these ruins for
countless years and have discovered quite a few dangerous regions
within it. Fortunately, I have an invulnerable aquaform; otherwise, I
would’ve died long ago. Here’s a map of all the danger zones I’ve
discovered thus far. I prepared it for you long ago; I was just
waiting for you to come out.” As Ninedust spoke, he tossed a rolled
map to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it and
gave it a glance. There was a detailed map of the palace ruins here,
with markings for the various danger zones. Ning revealed a delighted
smile. Without this map, he would have to carefully explore for a
very long period of time if he wanted to get a sense of what dangers
lay here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
catch us some golems,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ninedust was filled with eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a full month,
Ninedust found another chance to engage an Emperor-class golem in a
battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A vast wave
swept out to encompass an area of over a million kilometers. The
Ninedust Sectlord’s upper body was visible and utterly massive. He
wielded that longstaff in his hands, smashing it outwards like a
stream of water that completely embodied the essence of the word
‘entangle’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how the golem
struggled, Ninedust’s longstaff continued to circle around it,
preventing it from fleeing no matter how it tried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past,
Ninestaff’s staff-arts were more explosive and dominating; now,
they are much softer.” Ning was hiding off in the distance using
his Shadowless evasion-art, and he nodded at what he saw. If one was
capable of both hard and soft techniques, one would be able to
unleash still-greater power in combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he’s not
able to completely defeat that golem, he can at least ensure the
golem won’t be able to flee. After enough time passes, the golem’s
energy reserves will run low. That’s when it will be defeated.”
Ning could already guess what was about to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
“Help!” The Emperor-class golem finally let out a furious call
for aid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. The
battle had long ago attracted the attention of quite a few golems.
Upon hearing their comrade plea for aid, two Emperor-class golems
immediately charged over towards Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cracked a smile.
“Here they come.” Ning transformed into a streak of light,
clearly moving faster than a hundred times the speed of light as he
flew towards the two golems. Prior to receiving the guidance of the
Autarch’s Dao, Ning had already been at the limit of a hundred
times of speed of light. Ever since his Blood Drop stance broke
through to the fourth level, the power of his Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop had doubled. This upgrading of his Dao resulted in Ning
understanding many new things, and so his flying speed was also able
to break past the bottleneck of a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did he
suddenly come from?” The two Emperor-class golem reinforcements
were shocked. Ning had been maintaining the Shadowless evasion art
the entire time and thus they hadn’t noticed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!” “Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Friends, come and
help out.” Although the two Emperor-class golems were shocked at
first, they quickly calmed down. It was hard for even the three clan
leaders to catch them when all three were working together; what did
they have to fear? Instantly, all of the other watching golems
charged towards them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning had
already reached the two Emperor-class golems, [Three Heads, Six Arms]
active and six Northbow swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of mist-formed
sword energy struck out with terrifying speed. Now that the Blood
Drop stance’s power had doubled yet again, the attack was even
faster than it had been before! The two Emperor-class golems
frantically tried to defend, but they weren’t even able to touch
Ning’s sword before it gently coiled around them and bound them in
multiple layers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go, and you
too.” These two Emperor-class golems didn’t have invulnerable
aquaforms, and so they were easily taken away forcibly by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” “How is
this possible?!” The other five Emperor-class golems who had been
charging over to reinforce their comrades were all terrified, as was
the golem which was battling against Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This newcomer had
instantly captured two Emperor-class golems? How could he be so
terrifyingly strong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What they didn’t
understand was that although the three clan leaders were extremely
powerful, their attacks were clumsy and limited in speed to a hundred
times the speed of light. Blocking their attacks was naturally quite
easy! Ning, however, was different; his sword-arts were so incredibly
fast that he far outstripped the Emperor-class golems in speed. Given
how unpredictable his attacks were, he naturally was able to defeat
and capture the golems in just a single clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about two; even
if five or six golems were attacking him, he would be able to easily
defeat and capture at least half of them in a twinkling, then in the
next twinkling catch the rest. This was what made Ning so dangerous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. After putting
away the two golems, Ning turned to charge straight towards the
reinforcement golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t fight him
head-on!” The golems were all terrified. These golems were all
roughly on the same level of power; if two of them had been captured
in just a single clash, how could the others possibly dare to engage?
They naturally were terrified into a hasty retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord is too
powerful. He’s absolutely terrifying! Even worse than the three
clan leaders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if there were
ten of us working together, we still wouldn’t be a match for him.
He’d just capture us all, one after the other! I think we need at
least thirty working together if we want to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golems quickly
retreated behind some of the few remaining barriers. Neither Ning nor
Ninedust dared to touch them, but since the golems belonged to the
Sithe side they wouldn’t be attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, we have to
hurry up and join forces against him,” the golems discussed
internally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main problem was
that the palace ruins were simply far, far too vast. The golems were
all scattered across it by a distance of tens or even hundreds of
millions of kilometers. To gather them all together would take time.
If they tried to hastily gather together in smaller numbers, the end
result would just be that Ning would defeat them one-by-one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so… the sixteen
Emperor-class golems that were close to Ninedust’s battlefield were
all so terrified that they didn’t dare to come and reinforce their
‘comrade’. After spending the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea, Ninedust finally managed to deplete the Emperor-class golem’s
energy reserves and caught it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this was the
exact same method the three great clans had used to capture those
Emperor-class golems with invulnerable forms. This was why they had
quite a few of them. All combat consumed energy, and golems didn’t
have spirit-pills. Their regenerative speed was also far lower than
that of cultivators! A short battle was fine, but a long battle they
couldn’t escape from would result in capture once their energy
stores were depleted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally caught
one!” Ninedust was ecstatic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations.”
Ning flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only managed to
catch one because you blocked the others. Does this even count?”
Ninedust was still a bit worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with a laugh,
“That senior only said that you aren’t allowed to use Universe
treasures or outside sources of help; you had to capture an
Emperor-class golem on your own. And… that’s exactly what you
did! Me fighting a few others is a separate issue entirely. It should
be fine. Let’s go and ask.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
rather nervously flew towards the lion statue. Thankfully, the
treasure-spirit within that beastworld didn’t stop him. Instead, it
granted Ninedust entry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
started to laugh. “With this bit of luck under his belt, brother
Ninedust’s chances at the Daomerge shall be a bit better now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge was far
too difficult. If one wished to succeed in it, one needed to fight
for every scrap of karmic fortune available. Ning wasn’t confident
in his own Daomerge chances, but he wished for his best friends to
succeed in theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor-class
golems, eh? C’mere.” Eager to do battle, Ning once more charged
towards the golems. Wanting to capture them was part of his
eagerness, but he also had the feeling that he was gaining new
insights into the five stances of his Omega Sword Dao through combat.
His Soleheart stance in particular felt as though it was just one
step away from the fourth stage. Clearly, the 120 million years he
had spent memorizing the Autarch’s Dao had given Ning a wealth of
experience to draw upon.

Chapter 29 - The Plan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the beastworld.
Ninedust was seated in the lotus position within the altar, staring
at the giant claw-hand hanging in the heavens that surpassed and
transcended everything else that was here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ninedust
let out a long breath, then closed his eyes and revealed a smile.
“Success. Finally, I see a glimmer of hope for myself regarding the
Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ninedust had used
up the Voidsea Jadeseal, he had been able to simulate a Daomerge.
Although the simulation was partial and incomplete, he had still
benefited from it enormously… but alas, he still didn’t feel good
about his chances at the Daomerge. Now, however, he felt as though he
had a shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autarchs… they
truly are incredible.” Ninedust couldn’t help but let out a sigh
of praise as he rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? You’ve
memorized everything already? It’s only been five hundred million
years. Not bad at all.” The black-robed figure materialized right
next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninedust
smiled. “Not too shabby, but I wasn’t as fast as Darknorth.” He
was an Ancient cultivator; when he was a Daolord of the First Step,
his divine body and soul were already comparable to those of most
Daolords of the Third Step. Now that he had reached the fourth step,
his body and soul were unimaginably powerful. This was why he had
managed to memorize it all in just five hundred million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, right. Master
once instructed that every single cultivator who was able to memorize
these Daos would be given a treasure based on their performance; the
better they perform, the better a treasure they receive. Darknorth,
for example, has improved significantly! Once he comes back here,
I’ll definitely give him a superb treasure. Ninedust, go out and
pick a few fights. Show me how much you’ve improved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure?”
Ninedust grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, treasures the
Autarch gave me to hand out.” The black-robed man had an enigmatic
smile on his face. “An Autarch’s treasures are naturally
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, then let me
leave right away.” Ninedust was eager to do battle. The black-robed
man waved his hand, causing a spatial bubble to encompass Ninedust
and teleport him outside the beastworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ninedust
emerged, he saw the white-robed youth seated in the lotus position
next to a shattered wall that was within the ruined palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
Ninedust called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ji Ning
opened his eyes and smiled. “You finally came out. I’ve been
waiting forever for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You call that
‘forever’? Verge-level Daolords have all spent tens of thousands
of chaos cycles training before they go attempt their Daomerge. In
comparison, the amount of time I just spent was absolutely nothing.”
Ninedust transformed into a streak of light that flew over towards
Ning, landing right before the shattered wall. He asked, “You
must’ve improved quite a bit in recent years, eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.” Ning
grinned. His improvements weren’t exactly minor, but neither were
they extravagant. More than five hundred million years had just gone
past! During this period of time, Ning had slowly absorbed the
insights he had gained from memorizing the teachings of the Autarch.
He had broken through to the fourth stage with the Blood Drop stance
early on, but now he had done the same with the Soleheart, Yin-Yang,
and Shadowless stances. However, the Heavenbreaker stance had yet to
make the breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Going from being a
Daolord of the Third Step to being a Daolord of the Fourth Step was
incredibly difficult to begin with. Ninedust and Badlands had both
spent many chaos cycles doing just that, with Ninedust only
succeeding thanks to the legacy he had gained from that ancestral
Hegemon of the Ancient cultivators. As for Badlands, he still had yet
to reach the fourth step. As for Ning? His path was that of the Omega
Sword Dao; it wa far more difficult than Ninedust’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to make so
many breakthroughs in just a few hundred million years was already
terrifyingly fast, much faster than Ning had originally anticipated.
It was all thanks to the Stone Censer of Reunion as well as the
Autarch’s guidance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on this level
of speed… if I’m lucky, I might be able to become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step after a chaos cycle.” Ning felt quite eager. “If
I’m not lucky, though, I could well be bottlenecked for a ten or a
hundred chaos cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once heh did take that
final step and became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, the last great
barrier awaiting Ning would be the Daomerge. That would be the true
test, the deadly trial which he felt he had less than a 0.01% chance
of passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,”
Ninedust said excitedly, “That senior said that he would give each
of us a treasure based on how well we perform. He also said that
you’ve improved quite a bit. You’ll definitely get one
extraordinary treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He praised my
improvements as being significant?” Ning revealed an excited look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, that’s
exactly what he said.” Ninedust nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grew excited. He
himself didn’t know if his improvements counted as ‘major’ or
‘minor’ in the eyes of the treasure-spirit! Prior to memorizing
the Autarch’s guidance, he had yet to break through in any of the
five stances of his Omega Sword Dao. Now, however, he had reached the
fourth stage in four of those five stances. Was this ‘major’? He
wasn’t sure, but upon hearing Ninedust’s words Ning felt greatly
relieved. He now eagerly awaited what would be coming next.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the spirit of
the beastworld had believed that Ning had long ago reached the apex
of power as a Daolord and that Ning thus had very little room for
improvement. Given how much stronger Ning had become, of course he
viewed Ning’s improvements as being incredible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, good!
Ninedust, you need to make your breakthroughs as soon as possible as
well,” Ning said hurriedly. “The Autarch’s guidance truly is of
incredible help in cultivation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, after seeing
the Autarch’s Dao, I finally understood what petty, irrelevant
figures we are,” Ninedust said. “I’ve already gained many new
insights, and I trust I should be able to make a breakthrough soon.
Haha, I’ve fully memorized the Autarch’s Dao-guidance! If I still
can’t beat the likes of Dawnstar, the Radiant King, or Dreamlore,
even I would feel ashamed of myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, that’s the
spirit!” Ning laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My improvements are
nothing. I imagine even Eternal Emperors and Hegemons would love to
have a chance to gaze into the Dao-teachings of an Autarch.”
Ninedust shook his head. “Alas, blessings like this can only be
hoped for, not counted on. I’ve always felt that I’m incredibly
talented… if even this blessing isn’t enough to propel me past
the Radiant King and the others, I would view myself as nothing more
than a joke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and train,”
Ning urged. “Improve as much as you can. After we pick up our
treasures, we’re going to leave this world and return to the
Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
nodded. “I’m gonna go find those Emperor-class golems and fight
them again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should probably
stay away from me. Otherwise, those golems will refuse to engage with
you,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Why?”
Ninedust was surprised. “Did you beat them up that badly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kind of,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth… how
many golems have you caught, exactly?” Ninedust asked rather
excitedly. Emperor-class golems were definitely quite valuable; only
the Sithe had them in fairly large numbers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
caught a few early on, but all of them are quite clever; once they
saw they couldn’t beat me, they refused to battle me any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So how many have you
captured, exactly?” Ninedust asked again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you first
entered the beastworld, the Emperor-class golems began to assemble. A
total of thirty-two of them joined forces against me.” Ning shook
his head. “They really were quite cautious. Even I was put in
rather dire straits by their combined powers! However, I
intentionally held back some of my power, using them to temper my
sword-arts. After I managed to make a new breakthrough, I suddenly
struck out with full power and caught them offguard, capturing eight
of them in a row. The others were frightened off at that point… and
ever since then, they haven’t dared to approach me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight?! If we factor
in the two you caught when helping me out, then add in the two you
took when we captured three from the three great clans… that means
you have a total of twelve Emperor-class golems?!” Ninedust had a
state of disbelief on his face. “I only have two!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Getting envious?”
Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder they don’t
dare to approach you any further.” Ninedust shook his head. “Fine,
I’ll go hunt them down and fight with them. When I feel I’ve
improved as much as I can, I’ll come find you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. Swoosh! Ninedust quickly soared into the distance, flying
hundreds of kilometers away into an ruin-filled region. The golems
knew exactly how strong Ninedust was; as a result, they feared Ning
but not Ninedust! Three of the Emperor-class golems immediately
appeared and surrounded the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched this all
happen from before. A few seconds later, he leapt forwards and
transformed into a streak of light that shot towards the core Sithe
residential zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the place.”
Ning immediately came to a halt when he reached the borders of the
core region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dare to
invate the Sithe grounds yet again?” Four figures appeared in the
distance, roaring furiously at Ning as they transformed into streaks
of light and moved towards him faster than a hundred times the limits
of the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood three,
watching from afar. Ever since the weaker Emperor-class golems had
refused to battle against him, Ning began to harbor designs upon
these four stronger golems, each of which was on par with the eight
lords of the Sacred Cities. Over the course of five hundred million
years, Ning had already battled against them countless times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time he would go
to the very margins of the core residences. Once the battle started
to go against him, he would quickly retreat. So long as he left the
core residential region, these four golems would cease their pursuit.
They were golems, after all; now that their original masters were
died, they would forever carry out the final tasks their masters had
ordered them to do without any deviations. Only if they were forcibly
bound would they follow a new master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe must’ve
hidden quite a few treasures in the core regions, but these four
won’t let me get even close to them. I can see some of them but I
can’t acquire them,” Ning mused to himself. “I’ll see if I
can get Ninedust to come up with a way to capture a few more of those
Emperor-class golems. He can lead them and assist me in assaulting
the core regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sithe truly had
left quite a few treasures here. Almost all of them had been
shattered, but over the course of time they had slowly healed and
recovered. All of them were under guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
intrigued by them, but he just wasn’t strong enough to take them;
he needed help! Alas, the Emperor-class golems refused to even go
near him, giving him no chance at all. The rest was up to Ninedust.
Ninedust was viewed much less dangerous, which meant he actually had
a shot as he was able to lure the Emperor-class golems out of hiding.
He might actually be able to capture a few more.

Chapter 30 - Attack
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Sithe ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ‘Ninedust’
fellow is much weaker than Darknorth. Its been a few million years,
but he hasn’t been able to catch any of us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s normal! Did
you think that every Daolord was as much of a freak as Daolord
Darknorth is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperor-class
golems were excited to battle against Ninedust. Ninedust had indeed
improved, and quite a bit at that! But with the Emperor-class golems
all helping each other out, Ninedust had not been able to catch any
of them during the past few million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Endless.” Ninedust
spun the longstaff in his hands, his staff surrounded by thousands of
whirlpools as it furiously swept towards the four Emperor-class
golems attacking him. Two of them had assumed invisible forms which
tied NInedust down, whiel the other two fought Ninedust head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Traceless!”
Ninedust let out a furious shot, his longstaff dramatically expanding
in length as he lashed downwards at the warhammer-wielding golem in
front of them. The golem hurriedly lifted its warhammer up above its
head, seeking to block the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The longstaff
twisted slightly in an almost whip-like fashion as it smashed towards
the warhammer. An invisible ripple of power was transmitted from the
longstaff to the warhammer, slamming directly into the golem’s
body. Instantly, the golem’s entire body trembled as it was sent
stumbling backwards, then fell into a seated position on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Warsky!”
Another one of the Emperor-class golems hurriedly ran over to help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was one against
four, but Ninedust wasn’t at any disadvantage at all! The two sides
had battled evenly for quite some time, with Ninedust clearly being
much more powerful than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ninedust
suddenly began to laugh loudly as a formation-diagram suddenly
appeared with his palm. The formation-diagram quickly flew out and
expanded in size to cover an area of ten million kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
trapped.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Emperor-class
golems were all shocked. As for the distant golems who were just
watching, they were stunned as well. Ninedust had battled against
them for many years, but he had never used such an insidious
technique like this before! It was rare for them to encounter a
worthy opponent, and so they quite enjoyed the chance to battle
against Ninedust… but who would’ve thought that they’d suddenly
fall into a trap?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Ninedust, I
didn’t realize you were such a despicable person.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.” The four
golems were incomparably enraged. In the past, they had heard Ning
address the Ninedust Sectlord as ‘Ninedust’, and so they
naturally believed that Daolord Ninedust was his proper title.
Ninedust himself naturally didn’t bother to explain or correct the
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despicable? Hah! How
am I despicable? Because of the orders the Sithe gave you, you’ve
been stuck here guarding this rubble for countless aeons. Aren’t
you bored out of your minds yet? When the three clan leaders caught
your comrades, they would wipe out your golem-spirits and instill new
ones. I, however, can guarantee that I won’t wipe your spirits out
when I take you out of here,” Ninesoul said loudly. “You’ll be
able to see a much more colorful world. It’ll be a helluva lot
better than guarding this place for sure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste time
talking to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get ready to die!”
The golems were blindly loyal and devoted; although they were curious
about the outside world, as golems they would never think to disobey
the orders of their masters. This was the tragedy of golem lifeforms…
and if their new masters chose to wipe out their souls, their end
would only become even more tragic. It was a form of death, with the
new golem-spirit representing a completely different and new
sentience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
Ninedust called out loudly. Swoosh! The distant Ning had already
transformed into a streak of light that was flying towards this place
at high speed. Although he was hundreds of millions of kilometers
away, he moved faster than a hundred times the speed of light and
thus was quickly able to reach and move into the formation area,
passing through the barriers with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You finally made
your move,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and help me
catch them!” Ninedust urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two would naturally
be able to capture these four Emperor-class golems much more quickly
if they worked together. Two of the golems had invulnerable forms and
would be a bit tougher to deal with, but Ning’s attacks were now so
powerful that he was able to deplete their energy stores quite
quickly. Before the formation even had a chance to dissipate, they
had already been exhausted and captured ‘alive.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting away the
golems, Ninedust willed the formation around them to dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at those golems
over there.” Ning pointed off into the distance, where a number of
golems were hiding behind a barrier. The golems were staring towards
the two of them with mixed looks in their eyes; their gazes were
filled with eagerness, anger, and indifference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In their heart of
hearts, they would love to leave this place with us.” Ninedust
nodded as well. “But they are not only afraid of having their
spirits wiped out, they are also bound by their original orders to
stay this place. Alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they continue to
hide inside, there’s certainly no way for us to take them out of
here.” Ning shook his head. As Ning and Ninedust saw it, they were
helping these golems out by taking them away from this place!
Eventually, Ning and Ninedust would die after they most likely failed
their Daomerges, but the golems possessed perpetual life; they would
be given to new masters and would continue to live exciting lives. To
be trapped here within the Sithe ruins was far too meaningless an
existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We aren’t strong
enough yet.” Ning shook his head. “We can’t help them.” Ning
had tested himself against the barriers long ago, but even though
only a few fragmented barriers remained, the likes of him remained
unable to damage them in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I haven’t
had a chance to congratulate you on finally mastering those ultimate
attacks of yours,” Ning said. The plan he and Ninedust had settled
upon was for Ninedust to first use these golems to temper his
staff-arts. Only after truly mastering his new ultimate attack would
Ninedust actually move to capture them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came up with a few
killer attacks back in Crimsonwave Temple, but each had their own
flaws. After having a chance to view the Autarch’s Daos, I was able
to perfect those killer attacks and then come up with my three
ultimate attacks: ‘Boundless’, ‘Endless’, and ‘Traceless’.
These three ultimate attacks of mine are just as strong as the three
ultimate attacks used by the Radiant King… and perhaps they are
stronger!” Ninedust said confidently, “Who knows? I might be able
to defeat Daolord Dreamlore and be ranked as the third Daolord in all
the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He agreed
with this assessment. Ninedust definitely was on the same level as
Dawnstar and Dreamlore by now. As for who would win in an actual
fight? That could only be determined on the field of battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rest for a bit.
After your formation-treasure has regenerated its power, we’re
going to go attack the core regions of the ruins,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
turned solemn. Attacking the core region would be extremely
dangerous, the entire reason they had come here was in search of a
Sithe fortune to claim. They had gained quite a bit from the
Autarch’s Dao, but that wasn’t the reason they had come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another three days went
past. Finally, Ning and Ninedust simultaneously arrived at the outer
borders to the region which held the core Sithe residential ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one is permitted
to trespass within Sithe territory! Daolord Darknorth, you’ve
already trespassed repeatedly… and now, you are bringing another
Daolord with you?” The four figures flew over, eyes filled with
murder. These were the four golems comparable to the lords of the
Sacred Cities. These were the four most powerful golems in all the
Sithe ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this wasn’t
always the case. Long ago, these four golems were nothing more than
ordinary guard-golems stationed to the core regions. Those onyx
humanoids had Hegemon levels of power and were the mainstays in
battle! Alas, the strongest had been either completely destroyed or
taken away by the Autarch. In the end, only four of the ordinary
guard-golems were able to slowly repair themselves and recover. These
four ‘ordinary’ golems, however, posed an enormous degree of
danger to Ning and Ninedust. They were on the level of the lords of
the Sacred Cities, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you’ve always been quite careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve never dared
to truly risk it all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this? Only
two of us four will participate in this battle. You can fight us in a
two-on-one fight, but we’re going to fight over there, rather than
here in the border areas,” the four golems said. By now, they knew
Ning far too well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just shouted back,
“The four of you are extraordinarily strong. I really need to act
with more caution instead.” The four golems were truly strong; even
when Ning was focusing on defensive sword-arts, he could easily die
from their blows. Thus, he only challenged them in the outer regions
where he could immediately retreat once things started to go south.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Darknorth’s
companion first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s been
here countless times. Let’s remind him of just how fearsome we can
be.” The four figures had been thoroughly pissed off by Ning quite
some time ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust stood
shoulder-to-shoulder. “You ready?” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No worries,”
Ninedust replied. “I’m more than ready.” In truth, Ninedust was
feeling quite nervous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll succeed,”
Ning said. He was a bit anxious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! The four golems howled through the air, moving at different
speeds but all surpassing a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the perfect
moment. Attack!” Ning shouted mentally. A black rune-diagram
suddenly appeared within Ning and Ninedust’s palms. This was a
single-use formation treasure! An enormous black whirlpool appeared
and rapidly expanded, with over a thousand layers of energy swirling
around it. Every single layer of energy was filled with countless
complicated formations, and the entire black whirlpool quickly
covered the two golems who were the fastest and had charged closest
to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
used one of the black formation-diagrams, which meant two of the
black whirlpools had appeared. One was aimed inwards while the other
was aimed outwards, simultaneously trapping and repelling their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ninedust then
took out normal formation-diagram treasure, the single-use one he had
acquired from the ancestral Hegemon of the Ancients which could only
be used after charging.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An enormous
formation that was round within and square without suddenly appeared,
filled with countless layers of dense barriers. This formation
immediately surrounded the outermost black whirlpool barried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of three
formations were being used to trap these two Emperor-class golems!
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break! Break
for me!” The two trapped golems bellowed with rage as they
furiously assaulted the formation. Multiple layers of formations
began to tremble, with a few of the innermost layers actually
beginning to split apart. However, they quickly managed to
regenerate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was stunned by
what he saw. He sent mentally, “They really are strong. Darknorth,
these two golems are way too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why I came
up with the idea of using a trifecta of formations against them. We
need to trap them there as long as we can. Speed is the name of the
game here!” Ji Ning stared at the two slower golems who were
charging straight towards them. He certainly didn’t dare to trap
all four golems at once, because they had a way to merge their power
together. In that situation, the formation would probably last only
ten to twenty percent as long as it should!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” Ning
roared angrily. Swoosh! He charged forwards by himself, moving
towards the tall, skinny golem wielding a pair of enormous scimitars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning immediately began to battle against the tall, skinny golem.
Saber-light flashed everywhere, and each blow was incredibly heavy.
Ning couldn’t help but feel a sense of extreme pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to stop us, Daolord Darknorth!” The fourth and slowest golem was a
muscular golem who wielded an enormous greataxe, and he came charging
straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning willed
it. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A total of twelve Emperor-class golems
suddenly appeared in the empty void next to him. These were all the
Emperor-class golems Ning currently owned. As for Ninedust, he also
let out a furious shout as he released his four Emperor-class golems.
Although he had six total, two of them had other assignments to take
care of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Ning’s twelve golems and Ninedust’s four launched a simultaneous
attack against the greataxe-wielding golem. Swoosh! Five of the
sixteen golems had invulnerable forms, and they transformed into a
five-colored rope that began to coil around the greataxe-wielding
golem. As for the other eleven, they began to surround and attack as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to fight
against thirty-two Emperor-class golems simultaneously thanks to his
Shadowless evasion art, his Soleheart stance, and his Yin-Yang
defenses. This greataxe golem, however, relied primarily on brute
force! Thus, the sixteen Emperor-class golems were actually able to
tie it down once they entered battle against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, hurry up
and go get those treasures!” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ninedust immediately charged towards the core regions with his two
remaining golems by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop! STOP!” The
two golems trapped within the formation-diagram were enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” Ning continued to battle against the tall, skinny
golems. These golems all had their own strengths and weaknesses, and
Ning had incorporated them into his calculations for this plan! The
slow, greataxe-wielding golem was the strongest, and thus Ning left
it up to his sixteen golems to fight against it. This was because all
Emperor-class golems had incredibly tough bodies and didn’t fear
brute-force attacks; what they truly feared were sly, crafty attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, for example, was
dealing with just that as he fought against the golem wielding two
giant scimitars. Saber-light was flying everywhere in an
unpredictable manner! Sixteen golems probably wouldn’t be enough to
tie it down, and so Ning had taken on that responsibility fearlessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Sword-light and saber-light clashed against each other repeatedly.
Ning’s sword was faster and more unpredictable, but it was slightly
weaker. However… he was using a total of six swords! Thus, he was
able to tie this tall, skinny golem down and ensure that it was tied
down as well and unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the
formation-diagrams, Ji Ning, and the sixteen Emperor-class golems
working in harmony, all four guardian golems were temporarily tied
down. Right at this moment, Ninedust led his two golems in search of
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go over there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Try over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Smash that apart!”
Ninedust gave out one order after another, sending his golems into
the more dangerous areas he encountered. The golems were all
top-grade Eternal treasures and weren’t easy to damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha! Nice
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure is
actually able to affect spacetime?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take this one with
us.” The central residences were littered with formation-diagrams,
strange gemstones inlaid in stone pillars, and strange mechanisms
which had unknown purposes. The Ninedust Sectlord took every single
thing he saw! It didn’t matter if he saw an immediate use for them
or not; he’d worry about that once they got out of this place. For
now, his goal was to take away everything he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After just twenty
seconds, Ninedust had swept away virtually all of the items in the
territory protected by the four golems, with the exception of two
places which were protected by residual barriers and which couldn’t
be entered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ninedust
immediately fled at maximum speed. “Darknorth, let’s go!”
Ninedust’s voice echoed within the ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, thanks for
everything!” Ning led his sixteen golems in a rapid retreat.
Although the two golems attacking him tried to pursue him, there was
simply no way for them to catch up. After Ning fled out of the
central regions, the golems immediately halted their attacks and went
to help their other comrades break free from the three layers of
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the formations
had already been mostly destroyed. With all four golems working
together, it took merely five seconds to completely wreck it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
ended up getting what he wanted.” The four golems all sighed
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe in this
place died out long ago; those treasures weren’t doing any good. If
he took them, he took them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. We’re
supposed to guard this place, but what are we guarding? Our masters
died long ago…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four golems had to
guard this place and follow the final orders they were given, which
was why they had repeatedly intervened to stop Ning. In truth, they
personally didn’t care about the treasures at all. In fact, they
had long ago felt that their solitary life was boring and pointless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life had been much
more interesting lately with Darknorth around.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that he has the
treasures he wants, he’s probably going to leave. We’re about to
go back to our normal, boring life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought that we’d
be able to hold him back and we’d fight each other for a couple
thousand chaos cycles. Who would’ve thought he’d get the
treasures so soon?” The guardian golems all felt rather regretful.
It had been a long, long time since they had felt challenged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sithe who had been
living in the ruins had died long ago, with the golems bound by the
final orders they had given before dying. Only if someone was able to
forcibly abduct and bind the golems would their destinies be changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lion statue’s
mouth suddenly opened. Ning and Ninedust flew into the mouth,
entering the beastworld within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
Both Ning and Ninedust bowed respectfully towards the black-robed man
standing in the void before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve both
improved quite a bit, especially you Darknorth. There’s a limit to
how strong Daolords can be, and you had already reached an extremely
high level of power… and now, you’ve made great gains yet again.
Impressive,” the black-robed man nodded in praise. Although he had
been left behind by the Autarch to safeguard this beastworld, he had
never heard of an Omega Sword Dao and thus had reached a wrong
estimation of Ning’s abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Ning became a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, he would become truly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give each of
you a treasure.” The black-robed elder waved his hand, causing a
blood-red medallion with the imprint of a claw atop it to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, this is
for you.” The black-robed elder handed the item to the Ninedust
Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior.”
Ninedust excitedly accepted the strange blood claw-medallion, but
once he gained it he couldn’t find anything special about it no
matter how he scanned it. He glanced at the black-robed man with some
confusion: “Senior, might I ask what this treasure…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’ll also
give you a copy of a chaos star map.” The black-robed man waved his
hand, causing an astral scroll to appear. He unfurled the astral
scroll, which mapped out an enormous region of darkness as well as
three realmverses around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are the three
closest realmverses,” the black-robed man said. “This is the
Multilight Realmverse. This is the Redcastle Realmverse. And this is
the Flamedragon Realmverse. This Sithe warship we’re in has been
drifting through the Great Dark for endless ages. Based on the
trajectory and speed at which we were moving, I imagine we should be
close to these three realmverse by now. The two of you should be from
one of these three realmverses, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, how is it
that you know we are from the outside and are not cultivators local
to this planet?” Ninedust asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, as soon as you
broke through the outermost layer of deepfire blackstone surrounding
the vessel, I was able to sense you.” The black-robed man nodded
and smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust now
understood. “We came from the Flamedragon Realmverse; this place is
fairly close to the Flamedragon Realvmerse,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a coincidence.
The Flamedragon Realmverse has a special place within it that was
created and left behind by my master.” The black-robed man
continued, “If you bear this medallion… so long as you are close
enough to that place, you’ll be able to sense it through this
medallion. You’ll be able to use it to teleport yourself directly
inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is it?” Ning
and Ninedust were both curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Around here.” The
astral map rapidly zoomed in on the Flamedragon Realmverse, revealing
a specific place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?” Ning
and Ninedust were both shocked. “Inside the Aeonian Kingdom?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them had
extraordinarily high statuses within the Endless Territories. Thus,
they naturally knew where the headquarters of the Aeonians, one of
the six great powers of the Endless Territories, was located! The
place the black-robed man had just marked out was within the Aeonian
Kingdom. The Aeonian Kingdom was an incredibly mysterious place;
although there were very few Aeonians, especially strong ones, the
Aeonian Kingdom allowed them to sit securely as one of the six major
powers of the Endless Territories.

Chapter 32 - Verdant Azuresoul
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust said
helplessly, “Senior, you might not know this, but the place you
just pointed out is within an inconceivably powerful treasure known
as the ‘Aeonian Kingdom’! The Aeonian Kingdom is an extremely
dangerous place; not even Hegemons dare to charge into that place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance and
the Aeonians were mortal enemies; Aeonians relied on devouring
countless Daolords to awaken the Aeonian blood within their veins!
The more they devoured, the more powerful they would become! If it
wasn’t for the fact that they could take shelter within the Aeonian
Kingdom, the Aeonians would’ve been completely genocided by the Dao
Alliance long ago!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” the
black-robed elder laughed. “It doesn’t matter how dangerous it
is; you don’t need to worry at all. This medallion will tear
straight through spacetime and teleport you directly inside. If the
situation turns grim, you can use it to immediately tear through
spacetime and leave again. This medallion was personally forged by my
master, Autarch Bolin. Not even Hegemons would be able to trap you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust let out a sigh
of relief, then immediately asked, “Would I be able to bring
Darknorth with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The medallion can
only be used by one person,” the black-robed man said. “It can
also only be used to bring one person in escaping from that place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ninedust was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buuut, you can pull
Darknorth into your estate-world before using the medallion. That
solves, it yes?” The black-robed man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust immediately
looked at Ning. “Darknorth, things are going to be quite dangerous
inside the Aeonian Kingdom. Accompany me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For sure.” Ning
knew that in truth, Ninedust was actually helping him out rather than
vice versa. With that medallion in hand, Ninedust wouldn’t need to
even fear an entire host of Hegemons. What sort of ‘danger’ would
he be afraid of?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You must
remember this.” The black-robed man said sseriously, “The power
contained within this medallion is only enough to activate it twice
in a row; after that, the power will be used up and it’ll shatter.
Thus, the medallion is only good for a single entry and exit.
Treasure this opportunity and do not waste it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be exhausted
after just two uses?” Ninedust was started, but he then let out an
uncaring smile. “A single such opportunity and blessing is already
more than enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
nodded slightly. He was quite approving of Ninedust’s attitude. He
then turned to look at Ning. “I didn’t expect for you to be able
to improve so dramatically, given how powerful you already were. Even
I am now eager to see what you will be like if you succeed in your
Daomerge. Given your power, once you suceeed in the Daomerge you will
definitely surpass any ‘ordinary’ Hegemon. You’ll probably be
on par with Otherverse Lords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are Otherverse Lords
very powerful?” Ning asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. They are in
control of alternate universes and are assisted by the prime essences
of those universes. How can they NOT be strong?” The black-robed
man continued, “And you helped me out as well. Given how much you
improved… let me think about what I should give you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Helped you out?”
Ninedust glanced at Ning, puzzled. Ning was puzzled as well; since
when did he help this estate-spirit out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You didn’t know
this,” the black-robed man explained, “But when my master Autarch
Bolin entered this place, he used an evasion art to directly bypass
the deepfire blackstone and enter the vessel. He furiously massacred
all of the Sithe, wrecking all of their defenses and destroying
everyone and everything here. Afterwards, he tossed me here and then
immediately tore through spacetime to depart. He was hurrying off to
other regions to take part in the battles there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… Master forgot
that the entire vessel was encased in a shell of deepfire blackstone.
There was no way for me to leave!” The black-robed man said
helplessly, “Ugh… master created so many beastworlds and he
scattered them casually throughout the Chaosverse. He probably didn’t
think too much of it when he tossed me here, and he had to seize
every moment because war had spread throughout the realms. He didn’t
take the time needed to actually break through the deepfire
blackstone, as it would take some time even for someone as strong as
him to tear through it by force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust now
both understood. Deepfire blackstone was almost indestructible; even
Hegemons like Hegemon Welkin were completely unable to do anything to
it. It would take even an Autarch some time to forcibly break through
the outer ‘wall’ protecting this Sithe warship. Autarch Bolin
wasn’t willing to waste any time and so had used an evasion art to
teleport straight inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, when you
used your lifeblood weapon to drain away the deepfire blackstone, you
also gave me the chance to leave.” The black-robed man smiled.
“That naturally means you helped me out. I’ll now be able to move
through spacetime to visit other places and search for other lucky
people to bestow good fortune upon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…” The
black-robed man was silent for a moment. “And you really have
improved dramatically. I suppose giving you that treasure would be a
decent choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A round,
fist-sized object suddenly appeared out of nowhere within the
black-robed man’s hands. It looked like a giant egg, and it
emanated strange ripples that caused both Ning and Ninedust to feel
entranced by it. Their Dao-hearts were both influenced by this
effect, causing them to feel the urge to devour the thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master, Autarch
Bolin, has left behind some treasures in each beastworld… and this
is the most valuable of the treasures I have.” The black-robed man
looked at Ning. “This is known as a ‘verdant azuresoul’! Any
and every Hegemon would go absolutely crazy over this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, both of you
must swear oaths not to divulge any information about what has
happened here,” the black-robed man said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
senior.” Ning and Ninedust both hurriedly assented, while Ning
stared at the egg-shaped object with an eager look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various
realmverses of the vast Chaosverse are not truly eternal. There are
certain destructive forces of nature within the Chaoseverse,” the
black-robed man said. “There are certain terrifying celestial
bodies, such as the ‘Ship of Mirrors’, the ‘Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels’, the ‘Apocalypse Star’, and more. Even Hegemons are
helpless in the face of these naturally occurring celestial bodies,
and they can easily annihilate entire realmverses. Even Autarchs need
to pay enormous prices if they wish to be able to deal with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both surprised. They knew that the Flamedragon Realmverse was facing
a grave danger from the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, but who would’ve
thought there were multiple celestial bodies in the Chaosverse akin
to the Wheels?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ship of Mirrors,
the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, the Apocalypse Star… they are not
living entities,” the black-robed man said. “However, the
Chaosverse can also give birth to supremely terrifying creatures
known as ‘Chaos Primordials’ that are just as deadly. Supposedly,
these great beasts are born from the prime essences of the
Chaosverse. Once they leave the prime essences, they’ll voyage
through the Chaosverse… and they love to eat the realmverses they
encounter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Primordials
are born with nigh-indestructible bodies and are incredibly few in
number. They are also fairly unintelligent, perhaps on par with
mortal children. However, they are so incredibly strong that only
Autarchs are capable of killing them. Even Otherverse Lords are only
able to just barely fend them off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ‘verdant
azuresoul’ is what Chaos Primordials love to eat beyond all other
types of food.” The black-robed man looked at Ning and Ninedust.
“My master, Autarch Bolin, has made some special modifications to
this one, converting it into a magic treasure. Darknorth, you’ll be
able to bind it with ease just by dripping your blood onto it. After
doing so, if you ever manage to encounter a Chaos Primordial, you can
toss the verdant azuresoul over to it and let the beast eat it… and
once it does so, the modified verdant azuresoul will take control
over the Chaos Primordial and make it a servant that obeys your
commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
both speechless upon hearing this. “Can I use the ‘verdant
azuresoul’ as payment to have an Autarch reverse the flows of
spacetime to revive a Celestial Immortal?” Ning couldn’t help but
ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You cannot. A single
verdant azuresoul isn’t valuable enough,” the black-robed man
explained. “However, if you can find a Chaos Primordial and have it
eat the verdant azuresoul, then give that Chaos Primordial to an
Autarch? That would be enough to convince the Autarch to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Primordials
are simply too rare, while the endless Chaosverse is far too vast.
Finding one is a matter of luck,” the black-robed man said.
“Alright. I’ve already given you each what you deserve. Remember
- you are not permitted to tell others of what you encountered here,”
the black-robed man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
immediately swore lifeblood oaths. Ning and Ninedust then felt space
twist around them, followed by them reappearing within the Sithe
ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m leaving now,”
the statue said. Suddenly, it transformed into an actual three-headed
leonine beast that transformed into a streak of light that flew out
of the mountains. “If you can succeed in your Daomerges, perhaps we
might meet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
watched as the statue flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning and Ninedust left the Sithe ruins as well, returning to the
surface of the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of millions of
years had gone by. By now, Darknorth Palace had reached an utterly
towering level of strength, while the three great clans remained
hidden within their headquarters and not daring to come out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three great clans
were simply terrified. They had always relied on their clan leaders,
who had been completely wiped out. They naturally didn’t dare to
take any further risks, and thus they had come to a decision: “After
108,000 chaos cycles, our three great clans will once more make our
presence known within the world. By then, Daolord Darknorth would’ve
definitely died. I refuse to believe that such a freakishly strong
Daolord can succeed in the Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
secretly inspected the world for a period of time, then quietly
slipped away without causing any damage to the barriers or wards
surrounding the three great clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back to
the Endless Territories.” With the treasures they had acquired from
the Sithe lands in tow, Ning and Ninedust embarked upon their return
journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning had
reached an even more profound level in his Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop. It was now much more powerful, and thus as the two tore through
spacetime in the Great Dark they only had to spend a total of a bit
over three hundred years before they reached the Endless Territories
again.
