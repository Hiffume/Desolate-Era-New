Chapter 1 - Mid-Journey
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A boat was soaring
through the clouds and the mist, heading straight towards Stillwater
City. Ji Ning lay there within the boat, leaning against the stern of
the boat. From this position, he could stare down at the boundless
land beneath him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle. Father.
Mother. They must be avenged.” Ning pondered to himself. The scroll
his father had left him had the name of his enemy. There had been a
total of three malefactors; the primary one was named ‘Dong Seven’.
This was an extremely strange name, but this Dong Seven’s
grandfather was a Primal Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew his own power
quite well. To be able to kill Adept Xu Li truly didn’t mean
anything. After all, there were exceptionally powerful, talented
Wanxiang Adepts such as that Xue Hongyi, who Ning didn’t feel
confident in being able to defeat. As for those lofty, exalted Primal
Daoists…most likely, a single breath of primal flame from them
could incinerate Ning and shatter his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal fire…this was
a sort of ability someone only had upon becoming a Primal Daoist. No
one who was not a Primal Daoist was capable of it, much like how the
‘Myriad Manifestations’ could only be unleashed by someone who
was at least at the Wanxiang Adept level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of three
culprits, with Dong Seven being the primary one. As for the other
two, ‘Yu Dong’ and ‘Shui Yi’, they were accomplices.” Ning
pondered to himself. According to what his father had told him, Yu
Dong and Shui Yi were like manservants who followed behind Dong
Seven. Upon Seven giving the order, they would immediately attack and
kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, the
killers were actually Yu Dong and Shui Yi, with Dong Seven having
given the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Seven! Yu Dong!
Shui Yi! All three of you deserve death.” A savage light flashed
past Ning’s eyes, and then he considered what to do. “For now, I
can’t be in a rush to get revenge. My foundations are still quite
shallow; I don’t even know exactly how strong Dong Seven and the
other two currently are, nor where they are located. There’s no way
I can take revenge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s best if I
first go to Stillwater City. I should find a school and enter it.”
Ning mused to himself. Ning was no fool. His parents had previously
told him as well that after he went out into the world, he should
find a major power to take shelter under. After all, it was extremely
dangerous for a single, solitary person to go wandering the world by
himself. If he had someone to rely on, then things would naturally be
different. For ordinary Zifu Disciples, it was quite hard for them to
be accepted into a school, but unrivaled geniuses like Ning could
easily join with a major power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he obviously was
capable of joining a major power, Ning naturally wouldn’t make
things difficult for himself and act rashly by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upon entering a
school…I will be able to learn divine abilities within the school,
and even learn some supreme Ki Refining techniques.” Ning mused to
himself. Even someone like Jadechild had been able to learn the
‘Heavenly Transformation’ technique at Snowdragon Mountain. As
long as Ning chose a school that was even more powerful than
Snowdragon Mountain, he felt certain that the school should
definitely have a divine ability within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By borrowing from a
school’s strength…my own power shall rise greatly, and my
horizons shall be expanded. Only then will I be qualified to take
revenge.” Ning didn’t wish to lose his life for the sake of
revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was just as his
parents had said; taking revenge was one matter, but his life was
more important. He was going to ensure that his name was known
throughout the vast world, and that one day, he was going to meet
again with the Lord of Cui Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I am
not strong enough. Otherwise, I could simply directly enter the
Raindragon Guard.” Ning shook his head. It was too difficult for
one to join the Raindragon Guard. Even Adept Mu Xiao had entered as a
late-stage Wanxiang Adept. If Ning were to enter, even if he truly
were to pass, upon others discovering that Ning was only at the
seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and
yet capable of unleashing such great power thanks to the [Starseizing
Hand], they would certainly realize that something was amiss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine ability, the
[Starseizing Hand], was his true trump card. Ning wasn’t willing to
rely on this technique to enter the Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First find a school
and borrow from their strength to increase my own. Afterwards, I’ll
join the Raindragon Guard. The Raindragon Guard’s divine abilities
and techniques should be all-encompassing, and most likely even more
powerful than those available to the Marquisate of Stillwater.”
Ning nodded. If one was to stand at the peak, it would be sheer
stupidity to foolishly struggle randomly. Without a powerful Ki
Refining technique, he wouldn’t be able to break through to the
Wanxiang level, much less the Primal Daoist level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more precious a Ki
Refining technique was, the less willing a school would be to allow
outsiders to gain access to it. Anyone who disseminated a precious Ki
Refining technique would be hunted and killed by the school!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that his talent
was unparalleled…first entering a school, and then entering the
Raindragon Guard was the proper course of action.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of cultivation
was one where, as the saying went, every third person in a line could
become one’s teacher. The spirit of the underwater estate had also
advised Ning to take on many different teachers and masters, to
absorb the best from them, and thus more easily become one of the
great powers of the Three Realms in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
spoke out. The Whitewater Hound atop the boat turned to look towards
Ning. “Tell me. On this trip to Stillwater City, should I first
find a master and then pay a visit to Northmont Baiwei? Or should I
go see Northmont Baiwei first?” Ning said. “This man has treated
me quite well, and he asked me to go meet him if I were to go to
Stillwater City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei?”
The Whitewater Hound spoke in the human tongue. “This person has an
extraordinary background, and likes to make friends. Since he asked
you to do so, go and see him. This Northmont Baiwei must be quite
familiar with Stillwater City and the various schools within. This
will be of assistance to you in choosing a school to join.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
This made sense. After all, the only major sect within the Stillwater
Commandery area which Ning was familiar with was Snowdragon Mountain.
He didn’t know much about the others. However, within the borders
of the Stillwater Commandery, Snowdragon Mountain couldn’t be
considered one of the top schools. Only a school that had an Immortal
guarding it could be considered a top school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat Ning
was aboard didn’t fly too quickly. Each time, it would spend
roughly seventeen or eighteen hours flying, with the other six or
seven hours on the ground, where Ning would search for a place to
train, rest, visualize the [Nuwa Painting], and other things.
Travelling at this rate, he was able to advance nearly a hundred
thousand kilometers each day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth day after
Ning had left Swallow Mountain. He was aboard his flying boat, moving
through the clouds. “Eh?” Ning suddenly sensed a powerful ripple.
He couldn’t help but turn his head to look, only to see in the
distance, a tall ship was pressing down at high speed, generating
waves of air in its wake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the large ship,
there were many beautiful, flower-like women. On the second deck of
the large ship, there sat a young noble with white skin, who had
three beautiful women by his side, massaging his legs and his
shoulders. This young noble was dressed in red clothes. He held a cup
of wine in his hands. He flicked a glance towards Ning, but paid him
no heed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at that man
dressed in furs. I wonder which wild, backwater region he came from.
He has no class at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can tell with a
single glance that he doesn’t come from a major clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those beautiful,
flower-like women aboard the ship all spoke as they looked towards
Ning. Whoosh! The large ship sped off into the distance, quickly
disappearing from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ship is rather
fast, at least. I imagine that a Wanxiang Adept is controlling is.”
Ning still lay there in his own boat. It continued to ‘slowly’
and ‘leisurely’ advance at the rate of a hundred thousand
kilometers each day. Actually, through the flying speed of a magic
treasure, one could come to a rough determination regarding the
strength of its controller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The closer we get to
Stillwater City, the more frequently we encounter Immortal
practitioners. That large vessel was the sixth one we have
encountered.” Ning sighed with emotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City was the
heart and core of the vast Stillwater Commandery. Immortals and
devils congregated there. All of the larger clans, schools, and sects
would establish a branch in Stillwater City. Many Loose Immortals
also enjoyed to gather there in Stillwater City. Because so many
Immortals and devils were there, all sorts of treasures were
available in the city, which could be traded for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
security of Stillwater City was excellent. One could peacefully train
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to rest.”
With but a thought, Ning sent his boat charging downwards, towards
the desolate mountain forests below him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning’s current
power, it was indeed quite hard for him to encounter true danger
while he was adventuring. Only Primal Daoists could truly render him
helpless, but which of the Primal Daoists wouldn’t be hidden away
in their own estates or caves, training? Even if they occasionally
came out and wandered, they either travelled about in grand fashion
or moved about tracelessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The boat
charged into the mountain forest, then disappeared. Ning and the
Whitewater Hound landed on the ground. “I should rest here, I
suppose.” Ning said. With a wave of his hand, he tossed out three
formation flags which landed far into the distance, then disappeared
without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the outside world,
one wouldn’t be able to see Ning and the Whitewater Hound within
this area at all. Ning sat down in the lotus position, beginning to
train quietly, the image of Lady Nuwa floating in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
took out a scroll as well, and it lay there, staring at the dense,
complicated array of characters atop the scroll. This was a copy of
the [Nine Scrolls on Formations]. Ning had the original [Nine Scrolls
on Formations], and so by using a simple technique, ‘Water Seal
Technique’, he had printed out two copies of the scrolls. He had
left one with his tribe, then gave the other to the Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White was quite
knowledgeable regarding formations. In fact, his accomplishments far
outstripped Nong Zidao’s; naturally, he surpassed Ning as well.
Only, he hadn’t had sufficiently good scrolls on formations to
study from. Now that he acquired the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], he
naturally spent every day studying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies slowly grew
bright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
“Uncle White.” Ning looked at the nearby Whitewater Hound, who
was still lying there, staring at the scroll. Upon hearing Ning’s
shout, he immediately clambered to his feet, collecting the scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
boarded the ship, with the Whitewater Hound following him. Swoosh!
The flying boat immediately and quickly flew into the skies,
continuing to head towards Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” After flying
just a few dozen kilometers, the boat suddenly came to a halt. Ning
lowered his head, staring downwards. “What is it?” The Whitewater
Hound looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I sense a
disturbance.” Ning lowered his head, looking down at the
mountainous forests beneath him. Based on the strengths of the
ripples and the general location from which they came, he could tell
that it should be Zifu Disciples who were battling. He immediately
spread out his divine sense, quickly covering the mountain forest
below him with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even when he had first
broken through to the level of manifesting his divine sense, Ning had
been able to encompass a region of a hundred kilometers. After the
passage of half a year, his divine sense’s reach had further
expanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain
forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are the disciples
of the Meng clan.” A handsome, pale-skinned youth was roaring in
anger. By his side, there was a willowy, extremely beautiful maiden,
along with an extremely muscular and sturdy, tiger-backed,
bear-waisted youth. The three of them were struggling to defend
against their attackers, who were a pair of white-robed men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two white-robed men
had unleashed their magic treasures and had completely trapped the
three of them. “Dregs of Snowdragon Mountain. Once my father learns
of this, he will definitely annihilate you two pieces of trash.”
The handsome, white-skinned youth roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the two of you
were to leave…our clan won’t come take revenge for a trifling
matter such as this. But if we die, our Meng clan will definitely
investigate this matter to the very end.” The willowy woman shouted
in anger and fear as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only that sturdy,
muscular youth remained completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them truly
were disciples of the Meng clan. The Meng clan was one of the highly
ranked, extremely large clans within Stillwater Commandery, even more
powerful than Snowdragon Mountain. However, as one of the supreme
clans…it had quite a bit internal strife as well. Even the Ji clan
of the West Prefecture had its own internal struggles, much less a
supreme, giant clan like this one. These three were ordinary in terms
of talent, and they were born to a fairly low status within the clan.
They weren’t viewed as important, and found it hard to even gain a
change to learn some top-class techniques. Thus, after making their
breakthrough to the early Zifu Disciple stage, they immediately
joined forces and set out in the hopes of making it to Stillwatery
City and joining a school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
disciples of major clans who would enter a school. Generally, they
were all people who were not treated with importance in their own
clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, judging from their clothing, these three truly
are of the Meng clan.” The two white-robed men were speaking
mentally to each other. “Should we kill them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearly, you don’t
understand. A truly high-level member of the Meng clan, when setting
out on a trip, will have an entire entourage of maids, servants, and
guards. These three in front of us might truly be of the Meng clan,
but even so, they definitely don’t have any important status within
the clan. Kill’m.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two white-robed men
came to their decision, then immediately began to launch killing
blows.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_2___Arrival"></A>
Chapter 2 - Arrival
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, the
combined forces of the three members of the Meng clan had been enough
to just barely hold on, but when the two disciples of Snowdragon
Mountain stopped holding back, the three Meng clan members instantly
found fighting back much more taxing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had known this
would happen, I would’ve listened to what Rocky said.” The
beautiful, willowy maiden’s face was ashen. She was filled with
regret. These three hadn’t dared to continue with their training
after becoming Zifu Disciples, because if upon reaching the middle
Zifu stage, their foundation would have solidified into a set
pattern. Some of the more powerful schools wouldn’t be willing to
take them on as disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, all three of them
remained at the early Zifu Disciple stage. Prior to heading out, Meng
Roch had said: “Little Xin, our power, amongst Zifu Disciples, is
at the bottom end of the scale. If we were to fly on magic treasures,
then once we are attacked…we will be in danger. I recommend we walk
on the ground or ride on mounts, just like ordinary people, and
travel slowly. Although it will take more time, it will be far safer.
Immortal practitioners can’t be bothered to act against ordinary
commoners.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot.” The
other fellow, Meng Jun, had said with anger, “Ride on a mount and
travel slowly on the ground? That’s a distance of a million
kilometers. We’ll probably spend a year before we arrive! Hiking up
mountains and wading through lakes? Even if you are willing, I’m
not. I refuse to believe that if we fly as fast as we can, with the
goal of making it in a few days, we will be as unlucky as to
encounter someone who attacks us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky, Meng Jun’s
words are reasonable. It’s just a few days. There won’t be any
problems.” Meng Xin hadn’t wanted to spend a full year, and so
they decided to fly to Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…they
really did encounter bandits. Some Immortal cultivators kept their
heads down and toiled bitterly towards perfection, others relied on
battle to grow, while still others relied on on ambushing and
slaughtering. Ambushing and slaughtering was the fastest way to
acquire treasures. There truly were quite a few who engaged in this
line of work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash.” One silk
ribbon after another coiled about, defending against those
encroaching flying swords, but the force of the impact still caused
Meng Xin to vomit up a mouthful of blood. “Little Xin!” The
nearby, straightforward man, Roch, grew frantic. He gritted his
teeth, and his face suddenly turned red as his aura rose
dramatically. The nine black stones flying about in front of him
suddenly began to move at a far higher speed, and they howled through
the air towards the two white-robed men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, leave,
immediately leave!” Roch howled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky!” Xin’s
face changed. She naturally could tell that Roch had just used a
forbidden technique. They had come on this trip to join a school.
Using a forbidden skill resulted in harm to one’s cultivation
foundation; most likely, it would be hard for him to join a good
school now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and leave!”
Roch seemed to be on the verge of insanity. “Hurry and leave!”
The nearby, white-skinned youth had already transformed into a wisp
of azure smoke, fleeing at high speed. Gritting her teeth, Xin
followed after him and fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two white-robed
men, seeing this, just laughed coldly. They wanted to flee, as easy
as that? Those two were dreaming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a blurred
form emerged from the ground, moving as fast as lightning and
piercing straight through the heads of those two white-robed men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this be?!”
“How could…” The two white-robed men stared, their wide eyes
filled with disbelief. The two of them had engaged in quite a few
acts of banditry; they were extremely cautious. Even when engaging
others in battle, they would pay close attention to their
surroundings, but they hadn’t sensed any elemental ki ripples
earlier. And yet, they had been suddenly ambushed by a flying sword
beneath their feet, and their protective magic treasures hadn’t
stopped it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood splattered
everywhere, mixed in with a bit of white. The bodies of the two
white-robed men went limp, and then they collapsed, life having fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill.” The
simple, straightforward Meng Roch was in a berserk state, frantically
controlling those nine black stone globes. But suddenly, he saw, to
his amazement…that the two white-robed men collapsed to the ground?
Dead?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but…” Roch
couldn’t believe it. As for Meng Jun, who had been fleeing at high
speed, he turned to glance behind himself. Upon doing so, he saw
those two white-robed figures, lying collapsed on the ground. Given
his visual acuity as an Immortal practitioner, he could clearly see
the bloodstains on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister Xin!”
Jun hurriedly sent. “Don’t flee. Those two member sof Snowdragon
Mountain are dead.” Xin couldn’t help but come to a halt as well.
She turned, only to see that those two figures that had been battling
them earlier had indeed slumped to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go see
what happened.” Meng Jun said hurriedly. “Right.” Meng Xin grew
cautious as well. The two of them flew at high speed, returning to
the scene of the previous battle. Jun and Xin had confusion on their
faces. They stared at Roch, who appeared completely stunned. Jun then
said, “Rocky, what happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Suddenly, flames
descended from the heavens, completely enveloping the bodies of those
two members of Snowdragon Mountain, completely incinerating them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fire!” The three
members of the Meng clan were all startled. They watched as a figure
emerged from the mountain forest, followed by the unclear outlines of
a earthbound beast. When they took a closer look…they saw that it
appeared to be a delicate-looking, fur-clad youth, along with a
large, snowy white hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The fur-clad
youth waved his hand, and the magic treasures left behind by the
incinerated members of Snowdragon Mountain all disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior,
for your kindness in saving our lives.” The simple, straightforward
Roch fell to his knees, kowtowing to express his thanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to show such
great courtesy. No need to address me as senior either. We can simply
address each other as fellow Daoist.” Ning couldn’t help but have
a good impression of this straightforward man as he looked at him.
Previously, he had been watching with divine sense, and had
discovered that this man had used a forbidden technique and had gone
berserk while instructing the woman to leave. This made Ning think of
the uncle he had never met.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what his uncle
had done; that was why Ning’s mother had been able to escape, which
was why Ning was able to enter the world. Although Ning had moved
quickly, and even used his divine will to control the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword to attack before he himself arrived, it would be
hard for the honest-looking man to recover from the damage his usage
of a forbidden technique had inflicted on himself. “What a pity.”
Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, fellow
Daoist.” The white-skinned youth hurriedly pulled the honest man to
his feet. “The three of us are the disciples of the Meng clan. This
is Meng Roch. Next to him is Meng Xin, while I am Meng Jun. Might I
ask who you are, fellow Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky.” Xin pulled
at Roch’s hands as well, tears gathering in her eyes. At the same
time, she looked towards Ning. Towards this fur-clad youth, she felt
both curiosity and dread. Ning nodded. “My name is Ji Ning. I
encountered the three of you by luck, on this trip to Stillwater
City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, you
are headed to Stillwater City as well?” The handsome, slender youth
said with joy, “The three of us are headed to Stillwater City as
well. Brother Ji Ning, would you be willing to travel along with us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch and that maiden,
Xin, revealed expectant looks on their faces. Ning nodded slightly.
“Alright!” Earlier, when he had stretched out his divine sense,
Roch had just executed that forbidden technique. Thus, Ning didn’t
know who these three were. Judging from their names, however, he
could tell that they were from the same clan, and it seemed to be
that they definitely weren’t that old.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single clan
actually sent out three Zifu Disciples, all of the same age.” Ning
mused to himself. “And all of the same surname, Meng. The map I
have showing the various supreme powers include a clan named Meng.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons he
elected to travel alongside these three, was that Ning wanted to
learn more about the outside world from them. After all, the Ji
clan’s information regarding the outside world was far too sparse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, my friend Ji
Ning, taste this wine. This was brewed within our Meng clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My friend Ji Ning,
come taste this fruit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large boat was
sailing through the cloudy skies. Ning and the three members of the
Meng clan were all seated. There was a table before them, and the
table was covered with fruit and wine. Ning was clearly very
powerful, and the three members of the Meng clan wished to befriend
him. In addition, for Ning to travel with them meant that he was like
a guardian spirit for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So they truly are of
the Meng clan.” After having travelled with them for several days,
Ning had learned more and more things. Of the three, Meng Jun was the
most skilled in conversation as flattery; however, his flattery was
too obvious, making Ning feel rather irritated by him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Xin was definitely
an exceptional beauty, the likes of which would be hard to find in
the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Meng Roch, that
honest, straightforward man who had used the forbidden technique, he
was the only one of the three whom Ning had a good impression of and
was willing to make friends with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meng Jun’s words
are correct.” Xin shook her head, then said in a clear voice, “Our
East Bend branch has always been squeezed and pressured. Even the
clansmen of the East Bend’s main line of descent just barely get
by. As for those of us from secondary lineages, our lives are even
worse off…we are already lucky to have been able to reach the Zifu
level in training. To acquire top-tier Ki Refining techniques?
Completely impossible. The other Bends will all squeeze us and
prevent our East Bend branch from growing. Thus, the three of us,
after reaching the early Zifu stage, agreed to head out together to
Stillwater City and settle within a major school in the city. We
could go visit many schools and test them, one by one, but
unfortunately, Rocky is already…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch chuckled. “It’s
fine. It’s enough that we are alive. I only use a forbidden
technique once; the impact won’t be great. No matter what, we are
almost at Stillwater City! We’ll have the opportunity to walk
farther on the path of Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We’ve left
the clan.” Jun gritted his teeth. “When, in the future, we become
Primal Daoists…hmph. All of those old fellows of the clan will come
out and welcome us nervously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move forward stably,
step by step.” Roch glanced at him. Jun immediately raised his head
and sighed. “Unfortunately, the three of us are in an incomparably
bad situation. We come from the exalted Meng clan, but our magic
treasures were inferior to those two members of Snowdragon Mountain.”
Jun suddenly glanced towards Ning. “My friend, Ji Ning, your power
is incredible. You killed those two members of Snowdragon Mountain as
easily as killing chickens. I imagine that their magic treasures, my
friend Ji Ning, are completely meaningless. My friend Ji Ning…how
about bestowing me with one or two of the magic treasures, so as to
allow our strength to rise. That way, we won’t be slowing you
down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one or two. I
don’t ask for too many.” Jun stared at Ning, his eyes filled with
eagerness. Ning frowned slightly. This Meng Jun…engaging in
excessive flattery was one thing, but this? Ning realized that Meng
Jun had a ‘good point’; his tongue was completely shameless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one feels
irritated over having too many magic treasures.” Ning glanced at
Jun. “I am preparing to go to Stillwater City to trade for some
magic treasures, but I have too few on me. I’m afraid that I won’t
have enough. Fellow Daoist Meng Jun, how about loaning me one or
two?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun’s face
turned white. He tittered nervously, but in his heart, he cursed,
“How stingy. Last time, when I flattered young master Ruxu, young
master Ruxu gifted me with a magic treasure. I’ve spent so much
time flattering this Ji Ning and took out fine wine for him to drink,
but I didn’t gain anything from it. I saw how powerful he was and
the fact that he had a Zifu-level spirit-beast, and thought that he
must be quite incredible. But he’s still stingy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to even look at this Meng Jun. He had travelled with the
three, primarily because he wanted to learn more about the outside
world, and also because he felt kindly disposed towards Roch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
Meng Xin suddenly pointed downwards and shouted, “Look, isn’t
that Stillwater City?” “Stillwater City?” Ning hurriedly turned
to look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far in the distance, on
the vast earth below them, there was an enormous, gigantic city. One
couldn’t see to the end of the city with the naked eye. Even though
they were a thousand kilometers away, Ning could vaguely sense that a
series of ripples was emanating from that vast, towering city.
Although the ripples were seemingly weak, the power hidden within
them was endless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, just staring at
the city, felt an indescribable pressure emanating from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We made it.
Stillwater City.” Ning’s eyes were filled with anticipation.
“Stillwater City.” Jun, Roch, and Xin all had eagerness in their
eyes as well. Eagerness towards the future.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that it is
forbidden to fly in the air above Stillwater City. If anyone dares to
fly past its airspace, they will be in trouble,” Meng Jun said,
while the others landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared at the
distant city of Stillwater. This was an unfathomably ancient city
that had existed since the Fiendgod Era. They were currently only a
few dozen kilometers away , but Ning could already sense the
boundless torrent of elemental energy that was constantly coalescing
within the city grounds. At the same time, a terrifying presence
emanated out from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire
Stillwater City is like a gigantic formation; I imagine that there
should be an Immortal-rank formation there,” Ning mused to himself.
Ning and the other three members of the Meng clan hurried towards
Stillwater City’s eastern gate. The eastern gate was three thousand
meters wide and three hundred meters tall; from this, one could
imagine how vast Stillwater City’s walls were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your trading caravan
has a total of 321 members. Pay three hundred kilograms of
thundergold!” In front of Ning, there was an awe-inspiring merchant
caravan, with almost all members being at the Xiantian level. The
caravan handed over three hundred pieces of thundergold, and then
received around three hundred black embossed books as they entered
the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The city entrance
fee is two kilograms of thundergold.” A soldier dressed in
Dao-armor barked towards Ning. Ning was leading the Whitewater Hound
with him; naturally, they had to pay for two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
retrieving two pieces of a golden metal that flashed with an azure
light. This was thundergold. Its density vastly surpassed that of
normal yellow gold’s. In the past, when Ning had purchased his
Darknorth swords, he had used just a small piece of thundergold…but
to a Xiantian lifeform, two kilograms of thundergold wasn’t that
valuable. To Ning, it was even less noteworthy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Accepting the thundergold, the soldier handed out two black embossed
books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the three members
of the Meng clan and Ji Ning entered the city of Stillwater. The four
of them flipped through the black embossed books in their heads,
which had three characters on the cover: “Still” “Water”
“City”. Upon taking a closer look, they discovered that it
actually was a guide to the entire Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stillwater City is
9321 kilometers long and 8910 kilometers wide. It is divided into the
east city, the south city, the north city, and the west city, and the
Marquisate.” Ning read through the material clearly. The Marquisate
was located at the very center of the city, and was roughly eight
hundred kilometers in length. It was an absolutely forbidden
territory! Entering without permission was a capital offense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The east city, the
south city, the north city; battle was forbidden in these regions,
and they were safe places to live in. If anyone dared fight in the
city, that would mean they were challenging the authority of the
Marquisate of Stillwater! Thus, there were many, varied types of
Immortal practitioners who lived in these three regions, and even
some ancient Immortals would seclude themselves here and live
peaceful lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The west city?”
Ning’s eyes lit up. The west city. This was the most bustling,
lively part of Stillwater City! West Stillwater City was filled with
many large estates, whose owners had exalted statuses or power
rivaling the heavens. Naturally, there were some supreme clans,
schools, and sects that who set up branches here as well. Many would
come to Stillwater City and desire to take on a master, and these
people would go to these branches to request admission. In addition,
the west city had many merchants present as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was just one
thing! In the bustling, rowdy, lively west city, combat was only
forbidden in the streets. As for the various estates? No matter how
viciously or ferociously you battled within the branches of the
various schools and sects, it was fine. But of course, that was if
the masters of those estates and branches permitted you to do this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont
Blacktiger.” Ning looked at his book, and at the names of the
various estates that were situated in the west city. Amongst them was
the name, ‘Northmont Blacktiger’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Blacktiger
Estate. It has a perimeter of ten kilometers. In Stillwater City,
where every inch of ground is as valuable as gold…for Northmont
Blacktiger’s estate to be so large must mean that his power is
astonishing,” Ning mused to himself. There were also quite a few
member of high-level members of the Marquis of Stillwater’s
Northmont clan who had set up their own estates outside as well.
Still, the Northmont Blacktiger Estate, in terms of size, was
absolutely supreme amongst them. From this, one could tell what a
status he had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh!” Meng Jun
slapped his head. “So apparently, although it is forbidden for
people to fly about in the skies above Stillwater City, as long as
you are at the level of a Primal Daoist, you are permitted to fly
about! I thought that all people were forbidden from flying.” Meng
Jun had previously spoken about this in absolute terms, but upon
seeing the words written on the book regarding the actual rules, he
immediately remedied his ignorance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
West Stillwater City is an incomparably bustling place, especially
the ‘Treasure Trading Plaza’.” Meng Jun said enticingly. “Let’s
go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard that
there are thousands of Immortal practitioners who have set up shop at
the ‘Treasure Trading Plaza’,” Meng Xin was also quite eager.
Meng Roch nodded as well. “Let’s take a look then.” Ning was
quite eager as well. The Treasure Trading Plaza was a place that had
been specially set aside for Immortal practitioners to trade
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group had
entered from the gates of the east city. They had to pass through the
entire Stillwater City in order to reach the west city. This was a
journey of thousands of kilometers. Fortunately, all three of them
were Immortal practitioners…although they didn’t dare to move too
boldly and so didn’t walk too quickly, in but a single hour, they
had reached the Treasure Trading Plaza of West Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Trading
Plaza. This was actually an enormous public square, covered with a
dense cluster of stalls. Many Immortal practitioners were here,
having set up shop. Next to the stalls were various white stones that
were covered with black words, explaining which treasures the stall
owners were here to trade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many.” Ning
held his breath. “At a glance, I can see at least ten thousand
Immortal practitioners. Stillwater City truly lives up to its
reputation as a gathering place for Immortals and Devils. It is the
heart of the entire Stillwater Commandery. The Treasure Trading Plaza
actually has so many people gathered here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Trading
Plaza had all sorts of treasures, and even some extremely rare
curious. The greatest benefit to conducting trade here was…it was
comparatively cheaper! But the problem was…it wasn’t safe enough!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because it was
located in the west city. In the west city, only the streets were
safe from battle. There were no proscriptions against battle in the
Treasure Trading Plaza! It was absolutely possible that someone might
appear to kill you and seize your treasures…but of course, this was
still fairly rare, because generally speaking, anyone who dared to
bring out sufficiently valuable treasures to display also was in
possession of enough power to intimidate any thieves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although battle is
not forbidden in the Treasure Trading Plaza, there’s no way to tell
someone’s power just by looking at them. Thus, how can anyone know
how powerful someone else is? Perhaps the merchant might be a bored
Primal Daoist out for some fun,” Meng Xin said. Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Jun!”
Suddenly, a voice rang out. Meng Jun turned to look, and he was
instantly delighted. “Third Uncle!” There was a balding,
middle-aged man in the distance who was walking towards them, face
covered with smiles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Xin and Meng Roch
turned to look, immediately recognizing this man as well. They, too,
hurriedly called out, “Uncle Ming!” “Haha, all three of you
left your clan?” The balding, middle-aged man laughed. “It’s
good that you came out. In the clan, every day, you’d have to
swallow your temper and suffer indignities. It’s better to come
out. Did the three of you just arrive in Stillwater City?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun hurriedly
said, “We just arrived at Stillwater City. This time, we have come
with the intention of finding a master. However, we were curious, and
so we first came to pay a visit to the Treasure Trading Plaza.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing
special about the Treasure Trading Pavilion; it just has many
different types of treasures, some of which might be valuable.” The
balding man shook his head. “However, one gets bored after spending
too much time browsing. This is your first time visiting Stillwater
City; in the future, after you enter a school, you won’t have much
free time to wander about. I’ve spent a century in Stillwater City;
I’m very familiar with it. I’ll take you around to tour it and
see some truly excellent areas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun, Meng Xin, and
Meng Roch were all overjoyed. “And this person is…?” The
balding man had noticed Ning and the Whitewater Hound following
behind Ning. Meng Jun glanced back at Ning, but didn’t say
anything. At first, he had constantly fawned over Ning, but after
having received no benefits after so long, he had begun to look down
on Ning. Now, after he saw his Third Uncle…he had naturally
mentally discarded Ning already. In the future, he was going to join
a school; why would he need to pay attention to this Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Brother Ji
Ning,” Meng Xin said in a clear voice. “He saved the lives of us
three.” “Oh?” The balding, middle-aged man immediately said,
“Then I truly must thank you, fellow Daoist Ji Ning. Fellow Daoist
Ji Ning, why don’t you come along with us? This will allow me to
take better care of you, fellow Daoist, and show you proper thanks
for your assistance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head. Meng Xin and Meng Roch both looked at Ning, wanting
to urge him to come. But Ning laughed and said, “Let’s part here.
For us to have met was a form of karma; in the future, if karma wills
it, we will meet again.” “Alright.” Roch nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nearby Meng
Jun, he quirked his lips. He just smiled towards Ning, not saying
anything; however, his smile was clearly quite superficial. “What a
shallow person,” Ning, seeing the way by which Meng Jun was acting,
couldn’t help but muse to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After watching the
three members of the Meng clan depart behind their Third Uncle, and
especially the way in which Meng Jun continuously chattered with and
flattered the old man, causing his face to be wreathed in smiles,
Ning couldn’t help but shake his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time the Golden
Crow was about to set beneath the western mountains, Ji Ning, who had
strolled about for quite some time, finally arrived at the Northmont
Blacktiger Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a dominating
estate.” Ning stared at the distant estate. Before the gates of
this towering estate were rows of heroic-looking soldiers. The
enormous stone sculpture of a black tiger which stood next to the
gate was especially intimidating; the head of the black tiger stared
down at the passerbys, appearing quite tyrannical. All the
pedestrians walking through the nearby streets couldn’t help but
unconsciously move a bit farther away, not daring to go too close.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, he
walked straight towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who goes there?”
One of the soldiers standing at the gate to the Northmont Blacktiger
Estate shouted. Ning understood; once one reached a distance of
thirty meters of the estate without permission, the Northmont
Blacktiger Estate’s forces could simply kill the oncomer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and the ‘Northmont Blacktiger’ insignia which Northmont Baiwei
had given him appeared within it. Upon seeing the insignia, a smile
immediately appeared on the soldier’s face, and he said with
tremendous respect, “Might I ask who you have come to meet, milord?
I will make the report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Ji Ning. I have
come to meet young master Northmont Baiwei,” Ning laughed. “I’ll
have to trouble you to make the report.” “Alright, please wait a
moment.” The soldier quickly charged into the estate. As for the
other estate guards, the look in their eyes as they glanced towards
Ji Ning had become markedly more friendly. Still, they continued to
stare icily towards the other pedestrians on the street.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Suddenly, loud, clear laughter rang out. A youth strode out quickly,
dressed in a black uniform and with a crown on his head. Upon seeing
Ning, his face became filled with excitement and joy. “Brother Ji
Ning. I’ve waited so impatiently for you! You originally told me
that you would come quite quickly, but in the blink of an eye, half a
year has passed. You’ve truly broken my heart, hahaha. Your arrival
in the city of Stillwater means that you’ve arrived in my home;
there’s no need for you to worry yourself over anything. Leave
everything to me.” As he spoke, he walked forward, pulling Ning by
the arm in a very friendly manner. “Come, let’s enter the
carriage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By his side, a carriage
that seemed to be bathed in flames suddenly moved forward at high
speed before coming to a halt outside the gates. In front of the
carriage, there was a woman. The woman left the carriage, then said
respectfully towards Northmont Baiwei, “Young master.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Ninestar_Immortal_Ca"></A>
Chapter 4 - Ninestar Immortal Carriage
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come aboard the
carriage.” Northmont Baiwei pulled Ning up onto the carriage. The
carriage was roughly fifteen or sixteen meters long; naturally, the
insides of the carriage were extremely comfortable and spacious.
Baiwei and Ning entered, then Baiwei hurriedly said, “Sit, sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This carriage is
quite comfortable.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh as he spoke;
there were twelve seats within the carriage, and the seats were all
covered with incomparably soft furs, making sitting on them very
comfortable. “Young master Baiwei, the flames that cover this
carriage…?” Just now, he hadn’t sensed any particular power or
presence from the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just an
appearance generated by an emanation of elemental energy.” Baiwei
smiled as he spoke, then gave instructions to the outside: “Go to
the Carefree Caverns.” “Yes, young master.” The woman outside
immediately replied respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flaming
carriage immediately began to move forward at high speed. “Have you
noticed? This female servant of mine, along with the carriage…both
of them are constructs.” Baiwei smiled delightedly. “Ah?” Ning
was surprised. “Constructs?” He really hadn’t noticed. After
all, they were in the Northmont clan’s territory; Ning hadn’t
dared to casually release his divine sense to investigate anything in
depth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Baiwei
said delightedly, “That female servant is a golem which my father
bestowed upon me. It can explode forth with the combat power of a
peak Wanxiang Adept…and it is completely fearless. It is the best
guard one can ask for.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for this
carriage, the carriage is named the Ninestar Immortal Carriage.”
Baiwei’s face was covered with smugness. “Once it starts flying,
not even a Primal Daoist can catch up to it; in addition, it also
holds within it the Celestial Ninestar Flames. Once it unleashes
those flames…it can incinerate anything and everything. Even some
weaker Primal Daoist will be burnt to death by it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning,
hearing this, was shocked. Celestial Ninestar Flames? Capable of
burning Primal Daoists to death? Even if it was ‘only’ capable of
burning and killing some weaker Primal Daoists, this was still
inconceivable. After all, it was nothing more than a precious
construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Baiwei
laughed, then said, “My father personally bestowed that female
guard upon me, but I’m just temporarily borrowing this Ninestar
Immortal Carriage. This Ninestar Immortal Carriage is the personal
carriage of my father; even if I sold off all of my treasures, I
wouldn’t be able to afford even the slightest part of it. I’m
only permitted to borrow and use it within the borders of Stillwater
City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. So
this was the personal carriage of Northmont Blacktiger! This couldn’t
help but make Ning sigh at how deep the roots of the Northmont clan
were, here in Stillwater; even Northmont Blacktiger had a carriage as
astonishing as this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasured
construct on the level of this Ninestar Immortal Carriage actually
possesses sentience.” Baiwei stroked the carriage, clearly quite
fond of it. “Just now, when I gave instructions to go to the
Carefree Caverns, I was actually speaking with the Immortal Carriage
itself. This Ninestar Immortal Carriage will automatically lead us
there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to admit; this
really was incredible and impressive! One did indeed gain great face
when riding in this Immortal Carriage, capable of resisting even
Primal Daoists. This made Ning fully understand how wealthy and
luxurious a lifestyle the Northmont clan of Stillwater was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look outside.”
Baiwei pointed towards the outside world. Ning looked through the
windows. This Ninestar Immortal Carriage moved extremely rapidly, and
the streets of Stillwater City were incomparably wide; the scenes of
the outside world passed by in a flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most mysterious,
inscrutable part of the entire Stillwater City is the west city.”
Baiwei pointed towards the outside. “After entering Stillwater
City, you should’ve seen a book describing Stillwater City.
Although the book has the names and signs of the various estates,
have you noticed something?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve noticed that
the Northmont Blacktiger Estate is quite large,” Ning laughed.
“Haha, there are a total of more than a thousand estates with the
name ‘Northmont’ in front of them. All of them are the estates of
members of the Northmont clan with some status. The estates are
divided into three sizes; with a perimeter of ten kilometers, a
perimeter of one kilometer, and a perimeter of three hundred meters.”
Baiwei smiled. “But if you were to believe that these are the
estates of the powerful members of our Northmont clan, you would be
completely wrong.” “Eh?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The book should also
have quite a few estates which only have a name and no clan, such as
‘Kind Waters Estate’, ‘Universal Light Estate’, etc…”
Baiwei looked at Ning, who nodded. There were indeed some estates
like this. He didn’t know what the origins of these estates were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all the
private estates of Primal Daoists, as well as some Immortals.”
Northmont Baiwei looked at Ning. “Even some of the Immortals of our
Northmont clan, due to having lived extremely long lives, no longer
use the ‘Northmont’ name in titling their estates. This makes it
so that it is very hard for outsiders to truly understand how many
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals our Northmont clan of Stillwater
has.” Ning was secretly surprised upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many of the estates
are empty.” Northmont Baiwei very calmly discussed these rather
secretive matters. “In the vast, endless lands of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, there are some extremely mighty powers. If they pay a visit
to our Stillwater City, our Northmont clan will gift them with a
private estate. Although they will come visit only very occasionally,
we will always keep these estates in good condition.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so…West
Stillwater City is truly a place where fish and dragons swim
together. The more mysterious and unknown the owners of an estate
are, the less you can afford to offend them,” Baiwei said. “As
for North Stillwater City, many of the estates there have been taken
over by the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindragon Guard?”
Ning said in surprise, “I heard that the Raindragon Guard’s
headquarters in Stillwater Commandery is atop an incomparably
towering mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It isn’t
too far away; its name is the Crimson Dragon Mountains.” Baiwei
shook his head and laughed. “The full members of the Raindragon
Guard are all quite free and unrestrained; who would be willing to
remain atop that desolate mountain? Given how bustling and lively
Stillwater City is, and how they also have responsibility for
maintaining oversight over the various major powers within Stillwater
City, the Raindragon Guards naturally have occupied quite a large
amount of land.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most of the north
city is occupied by the Raindragon Guard. In the south city, most of
the residences are occupied by the Immortal practitioners that make
up the soldiers of our army.” Baiwei laughed. “This is something
of an open secret, but naturally, this won’t be recorded in those
simple information pamphlets given to everyone who enters the city.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only the east city
has many major trading unions and guilds, along with Loose Immortals,
who gather there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they continued to
advance forward, Baiwei told Ning about some secrets, but only those
which many people would learn upon reaching a certain leve. This
truly broadened Ning’s horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the east city,
there were many places for entertainment present. The most famous of
those places was the Mountain of Heavenly Treasures! “The Mountain
of Heavenly Treasures takes up an area of six hundred kilometers. It
is a mountain located within the city itself, and the entire mountain
is hollow. There are countless treasures within, along with merchants
selling spirit-beasts and slaves, and all sorts of gambles and
battles…in short, any sort of entertainment you can think of, the
Mountain of Heavenly Treasures has it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei shook his head
and said resignedly, “However, this Heavenly Treasures Mountain has
the imperial clan of the Grand Xia Dynasty standing behind it! In
this vast world, every single commandery city has a Heavenly
Treasures Mountain within it. I can’t even imagine how much wealth
they have accumulated for the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The place I’m
taking you to, right now, is named ‘Carefree Cave’.” Baiwei
winked towards Ning. “The two most exquisite entertainment venues
in the entire Stillwater City are the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and
the Carefree Cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain is something that can be seen throughout the Grand
Xia Dynasty. But the Carefree Cave is unique to our Stillwater City,
and it was established by three Celestial Fox Immortals.” Baiwei
chortled, “But of course, it also has the support of our Northmont
clan of Stillwater. After all, we can’t let the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain make all the money, right?” Ning laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master. We are
here.” The voice came from outside. As it did, the speed of the
Ninestar Immortal Carriage quickly dropped as well. Baiwei led Ning
out of the carriage, then pointed to an incomparably vast edifice in
front of them. “This is the Carefree Cavern.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly grew
rather stunned. He saw, far away, an enormous, incomparably
beautiful, dream-like edifice. It was shaped into the form of a
titanic fox; this was a giant building that appeared like a fox that
was hundreds of kilometers long. Its entrance was the mouth of the
fox, which had its head resting against the ground. The dense natural
elemental energy in the surrounding area made Ning feel incomparably
comfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
leapt out of the carriage as well. Staring at this alongside Ning, it
too had a look of shock in its eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Baiwei,
please, come, come.” Instantly, a tall, muscular, ox-horned man ran
over. His aura rolled out in waves, startling Ning; this monster
clearly wasn’t hiding its aura at all, which allowed Ning to verify
that it should be at the Wanxiang Adept level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm.” Northmont
Baiwei nodded casually. “And this one is…?” The Diremonster
looked towards Ning. “This is my good friend, young master Ji
Ning.” Baiwei explained. The Diremonster hurriedly nodded. “Is
this your first time, young master Ji Ning?” Appearing quite
courteously, he led the way forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept his gaze
forward. He quickly discovered that there were many people who had
entered the Carefree Caverns to enjoy themselves; however, most
didn’t have any attendants come welcome them. Although some
occasionally did, most of the attendants were at the Xiantian
lifeform level, or at most at the Zifu Disciple level. Only Northmont
Baiwei had a Wanxiang-level Diremonster welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Whitewater
Hound followed Northmont Baiwei forward. The wide, spacious corridor
was beautiful and almost dreamlike. Soon, they exited it and arrived
at an enormous hall. At the left side of the main hall was a row of
individuals who were either monsters or beautiful female Immortal
practitioners. To the right, there was a row of individuals who were
either monsters or handsome male Immortal practitioners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We respectfully
welcome young master Northmont and young master Ji.” In unison, the
individuals all bowed with respect, their sleeves drooping to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon being welcomed so
respectfully by so many monsters and Immortal practitioners, and
especially upon hearing them all call out loudly, Ning was instantly
stunned. Fortunately, his soul was very strong, and so he quickly
came to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How incredible. The
Carefree Caverns really live up to their reputation as a place
established by three Celestial Fox Immortals and the Marquisate of
Stillwater.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were currently
many guests seated within the main hall, and amongst them were four
people Ning knew quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun, Meng Roch,
and Meng Xin had been led by the uncle of their clan into the
Carefree Caverns as well. That balding, middle-aged man had said,
“The Carefree Caverns are the most top tier of top tier
entertainment sights. In terms of sheer pleasure, it is actually
superior to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. There are delicacies
here which those of you back in the clan would never be able to even
imagine. You will soon enter various schools, and so today, I’ll
show you around here and broaden your horizons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this the
silverpike of Jimin?” Meng Jun ate while sighing in praise. As for
Xin and Roch, they were clearly also eating quite happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to them was a
Xiantian monster who had transformed into a beautiful woman, who was
dancing about gracefully. There were also human Xiantian maidens who
were playing the zither…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The balding,
middle-aged man suddenly turned his head. Through another corridor of
the main hall, a group of beautiful women suddenly appeared, either
emanating a monstrous aura or an Immortal practitioner’s aura. A
similar group of men appeared as well. They divided up into two rows,
as though respectfully awaiting someone’s arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major figure has
arrived.” The balding, middle-aged man said hurriedly. “What’s
that?” Roch turned to look, puzzled. Xin called out in surprise,
“All of them are releasing their auras. It seems they are all
Zifu-level Diremonsters or Immortal practitioners.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, what sort of a
person are they here to welcome?” Meng Jun’s eyes began to shine.
If he was able to make friends with this major figure, wouldn’t he
instantly rise to the heavens? Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two rows of
stunningly beautiful and handsome men and women, who lined up deep
into the recesses of the corridor, all said with great courtesy, “We
respectfully welcome young master Northmont and young master Ji.”
Their voices echoed within the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Northmont?” The balding, middle-aged Third Uncle immediately said
in a low voice, “This is someone from the Northmont clan of the
Marquisate of Stillwater, and definitely someone in the main lineage
with a high status. Otherwise, there is no way the Carefree Caverns
would treat him with such great ceremony. But who is this young
master Ji?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what
sort of major figure of Stillwater City this is.” Meng Jun
immediately looked over carefully. In fact, quite a few people were
looking towards the distant corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youngster dressed in
a black uniform and a crown walked in. By his side was a youth clad
in fur. Behind them was a Godbeast Whitewater Hound, along with a
female servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning?”
Meng Jun, Meng Xin, and Meng Roch were all completely stunned.

Chapter 5 - Joining a School
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wasn’t that Ji Ning,
who had previously saved them? By his side was that Godbeast, the
Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a period of time,
Meng Jun, Meng Roch, and Meng Xin’s hearts were filled with
incomparably complex feelings. “Young master Ji Ning is this
incredible?” Xin murmured to herself softly. “I knew all along
that Brother Ji Ning was an extraordinary person.” Roch sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Jun, a sunken,
dark look was on his face. Previously, on their way over together
with Ji Ning to Stillwater City, Jun had realized that Ning didn’t
possess much worldly experience. In experience, Ning was very stingy.
Thus, he ceased flattering Ning, and even went so far as to not even
bother putting on a pretense of cordiality. He knew that Ning had
opinions about him, but in the past he hadn’t cared about that.
Now, however, he understood that it was probably too late for him to
repair the relationship between himself and Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it so very
glorious and amusing for an honorable, exalted young master to
pretend to be a bumpkin?” Meng Jun felt hidden resentment in his
heart. “And you dressed in those furs. You really know how to put
on an act! Now look at how arrogantly you are acting today. I refuse
to believe that in the future, I won’t surpass you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the three
members of the Meng clan were sighing for different reasons. By their
side, their Third Uncle spoke out. “The Ji Ning we previously met
at the Treasure Trading Plaza? Young master Ji?” The bald Third
Uncle was shocked. He then said regretfully, “Alas, I didn’t
expect that young master Ji had such an incredible status. I actually
missed the chance to befriend a person like him; what a pity, what a
pity!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun’s face
became all the uglier to behold. Just you wait, he told himself. He
would show them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt extremely
stunned to have been welcomed by so many beautiful women, handsome
men, and Diremonsters, all of whom were at the Zifu Disciple level.
For so many Diremonsters and Immortal practitioners to work here as
servants…this showed how formidable those three Celestial Fox
Immortals were, and also how much time and effort the Marquisate of
Stillwater had expended on the Carefree Caverns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Carefree Caverns
are quite a relaxing, entertaining place. Even Immortals wouldn’t
dare act brashly here.” Northmont Baiwei led Ning inwards. The two
constantly advanced through the wide, winding hallways, the
Whitewater Hound and the maidservants following behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
they had walked more than thirty kilometers. To Immortal
practitioners, this truly was a short distance. What stunned Ning the
most was that the ceiling of the thirty-kilometer walkway was studded
with many enormous jewels which flashed with all sorts of colors.
This made the walkway appear both beautiful and dreamlike. Ning had
seen some things in his life already, but jewels of such size…the
Ji clan had never possessed any like them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are jewels
which were brought here, with great effort, from the depths of the
North Sea. Every single one is a precious item that can be used to
refine magic treasures, and they are also luminous by nature, being
capable of drawing in elemental energy. A single one of these jewels
is worth approximately as much as a single Earth-ranked magic
treasure.” Baiwei continued in a soft voice, “The total value of
the jewels and decorations in the entire Carefree Caverns is enough
to render even an Immortal speechless and stupefied.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, himself, was
speechless as well. Extravagant. Truly extravagant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to be able
to compete with the Heavenly Treasures Mountain,” Baiwei said
softly. “The luxuriousness of the Carefree Caverns is definitely
not inferior to that of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a
pink-clothed woman with furry ears and a fox’s tail came towards
them from afar. Her smile seemed to be filled with an innate charm
and allure. She stepped forward, one step at a time, her fox’s tail
swaying along with her rear in an undulating, enticing manner. Ning
was instantly stunned as well, but soon afterwards, he regained his
calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
pink-clothed woman looked at Ning in astonishment, then she laughed.
“This must be young master Ji. It seems this is your first time
here.” Northmont Baiwei laughed loudly. “This is my brother Ji
Ning’s first visit to Stillwater City. I brought him here to show
him our Stillwater City’s Carefree Caverns. It seems, Miss Ziyi,
you aren’t very happy by the fact that my brother wasn’t
bewildered by your charms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t dare.”
Miss Ziyi laughed. “Young master Baiwei, the same place as usual?”
“Naturally.” Northmont Baiwei nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi looked
carefully at Ning, then led the way forward. In front of them was an
enormous hall. The entire hall had a circumference of many
kilometers, and atop the hall were many jewels of different colors.
The floor of the hall was covered with thirty-meter tall sea corals,
along with varied other decorations. The entire hall was decorated
like an abode from Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had the
benefit of his memories from his previous life, he was still stunned.
This was a hall that was kilometers in size, decorated with all sorts
of marvelous items. Even in his past life, he had never been as
stunned as he was today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were tens of
women who were fluttering about in a dance within the hall, as well
as tens of master musicians playing the zither and other instruments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Baiwei,
young master Ji, please, this way.” Miss Ziyi led them towards an
arced entrance that hung in the air, then pushed the door open.
Within, there was a secluded, refined private room that was more than
thirty meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arrange for the
Hundred Treasures Banquet,” Northmont Baiwei instructed. “Alright.”
Miss Ziyi immediately departed, leaving only Ning, Baiwei, the
Whitewater Hound, and that female servant within the secluded room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a place that
must have been sculped with the hands of the heavens.” Ning walked
to the sides of the room. He stared through the completely open
window, able to see straight down to the massive hall that was
kilometers in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is nothing.”
Northmont Baiwei lowered his voice to a whisper. “The Carefree
Caverns have many places for enjoyment. Some of them, even I am not
permitted to enter. For example, the legendary ‘Palace of
Immortals’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace of
Immortals?” Ning was startled. “Indeed. Only Immortals or
extremely important figures are permitted to enter. Supposedly,
Primal Daoists are responsible for serving them; on occasion, even
one of those three Celestial Fox Immortals will personally go welcome
them.” Baiwei continued, “Stillwater City is the heart of the
entire Stillwater Commandery. Thus, most of the Immortals are
gathered here. Normally, when they hold meetings, they hold them
within the Carefree Caverns. Only, when they enter the Carefree
Caverns, they will directly fly in through the air, and then enter
through a private, exclusive entrance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Immortals?
Given how vast Stillwater Commandery was, and how long it had been in
existence for, there truly were quite a few Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals present here. Thus, only a school that had an Immortal
guarding it could truly be considered a supreme, top-tier school.
Those which did not have any Immortals, such as Snowdragon Mountain,
were clearly on a lower level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Immortals were
truly the most supreme of individuals within the entire Stillwater
Commandery. They alone would decide the fate of Stillwater
Commandery, decide the fates of its countless tribes, decide who
would rise and who would fall. Even the Marquisate of Stillwater had
to curry favor with these Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One platter of precious
delicacies after another was brought in. They even prepared a
secondary side banquet for the Whitewater Hound, and all of the foods
they prepared were those which Godbeast Whitewater Hounds loved to
eat. All of the food was extremely exquisitely made. They all had
extraordinary pedigrees. Ning, just listening to the servants
describe each of the dishes, began to grow hungry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they ate for
quite some time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave for
now,” Baiwei instructed his servant. “Yes.” The maidservant
left respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Baiwei
lifted his beastskull goblet of wine. “Previously, you mentioned to
me that you are going to enter a school. Have you made your choice?”
“Not yet.” Ning shook his head. “Brother Baiwei, can you
introduce me to some?” Baiwei immediately asked, “What are your
requirements?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that my
school will have divine abilities, top-tier Ki Refining techniques,
and ideally specialize in sword techniques,” Ning said. Divine
abilities and Ki Refining techniques…these would be for
establishing his training foundations. However, the Dao he had gained
insight into and the Dao he had embarked upon was the Dao of the
sword. On the path of Immortals, one’s insights into the Dao was
one’s truest foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Baiwei
pondered momentarily, then laughed. “You want a school that has
divine abilities, top-tier Ki Refining techniques, and which
specializes in sword techniques…I do, in fact, have a school to
recommend.” Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This school is named
the Skysplitter Sword Sect.” Baiwei said with great confidence,
“This Skysplitter Sword Sect is ranked as one of the top three
major sects within Stillwater Commandery. In the past, didn’t you
have some disputes with Snowdragon Mountain? Compared to them…well,
Snowdragon Mountain simply can’t compare. This Skysplitter Sword
Sect has at least three Immortals! As for Primal Daoists, it has tens
of them! Zifu Disciples? It has more than ten thousand!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rendered
speechless. Tens of Primal Daoists and three Immortals? This, alone,
was enough to stun Ning. Generally speaking, a single Immortal was
enough to make a sect a supreme sect. But at least three Immortals?
No wonder it was ranked amongst the top three major sects within
Stillwater Commandery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Skysplitter
Sword Sect is famous for its sword techniques.” Baiwei continued
quickly, “Just from the name ‘Skysplitter Sword Sect’, you
should realize that they are celebrated for their swordplay. More
than eighty million years has passed since the founder of the
Skysplitter Sword Sect established the sect. The founder of the
Skysplitter Sword Sect was a Loose Immortal who had lived for
hundreds of thousands of years. He truly was an incredible figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how much time
has passed since its founding till now…the amount of sword
techniques its successive generations have developed is most likely
innumerable.” Baiwei looked at Ning. “It is estimated that this
school has at least two or three divine abilities as well, and it
certainly must have many supreme Ki Refining techniques. Otherwise,
there is no way it could have given rise to so many Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of excitement
appeared on Ning’s face. What a school! There was shade to be found
beneath the eaves of a large tree. If he was going to rely on the
power of a school to increase his own power, then naturally he had to
choose a mighty school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Skysplitter
Sword Sect has a branch within Stillwater City. Generally speaking,
it will only officially accept new students during the twelth lunar
month. Although there is one more month before then…I’ll take you
there tomorrow. I’ll simply need to say a few things to them, and
this matter will be settled in advance.” Baiwei smiled as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a look of
excitement and joy. “Thank you, Brother Baiwei.” “Haha, Ji
Ning, for you to join the Skysplitter Sword Sect is their great
fortune.” Baiwei laughed loudly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He
stared down through the open window to the nearby corridor it
overlooked, then called out in a high voice, “Brother Zhou Li!” A
white-clothed man below them raised his head, then laughed and said,
“Brother Baiwei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Zhou Li, why
don’t you come up for a few moments?” Baiwei called out in a loud
voice. “Alright.” The white-clothed man laughed, nodded, then
moved towards the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei hurriedly said
to Ning, “This person, Zhou Li, is one of the disciples of the
Skysplitter Sword Sect who has been sent to stay in Stillwater City.
He is a Wanxiang Adept, and quite influential within the Skysplitter
Sword Sect. We just need to mention this matter to him. As long as he
says yes, then the matter of you entering the Skysplitter Sword Sect
will be settled.” Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A knocking sound could
be heard. Baiwei hurriedly rose, personally going to open the door.
Ning, naturally, followed behind him to welcome the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Brother Zhou
Li, just now, I was discussing your Skysplitter Sword Sect, and now
you appear. Isn’t this quite the coincidence?” Baiwei immediately
said, “Let me make an introduction. This is my extremely good
friend, Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
The white-clothed Zhou Li, upon hearing Baiwei describe Ning as ‘my
extremely good friend’, didn’t dare to treat Ning lightly,
immediately clasping his hands in greeting as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Zhou Li.”
Ning returned the greeting. Baiwei immediately said, “Come, come in
and sit.” “Not now.” The white-clothed Zhou Li immediately
explained, “I’m here on someone’s invitation, and I must go
meet with them. Brother Baiwei, if there is anything you need, feel
free to tell me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei immediately
said, “I’ll speak frankly then. This Brother Ji Ning of mine has
heard of the fame and reputation of the Skysplitter Sword Sect, and
his heart was stirred. He would like to enter your Skysplitter Sword
Sect, and so I wanted to let you know about this, Zhou Li. I trust
that once you give the word, this matter will be settled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
white-clothed man, Zhou Li, looked towards Ning. He asked Ning,
“Brother Ji Ning, what level have you trained to?” Ning replied,
“I’m a twin-refiner; both a Ki Refiner and a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. Both are at the early Zifu stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, early Zifu
stage? Good.” The white-clothed Zhou Li immediately felt relieved.
Laughing, he said with confidence, “When accepting new disciples,
our greatest concern is that they might have trained in some
superficial, inferior techniques and destroyed their future
potential. Since you are at the early Zifu stage…your foundation
hasn’t yet become fixed and immutable. Just let me give the word
first, and when the time of the twelth lunar month comes, you can go
to our local branch of the Skysplitter Sword Sect. You will
immediately be accepted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Baiwei
laughed, then said in praise, “Ji Ning, await the twelth lunar
month. When it comes, you will be a disciple of the Skysplitter Sword
Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently. The
Skysplitter Sword Sect? In the future, he was going to be a disciple
of the Skysplitter Sword Sect!
</P>

Chapter 6 - Encountering Northmont Fox
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the refined
room closed once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can stop
worrying now.” Northmont Baiwei sat down, then picked up the
exquisitely made wine flask and poured Ji Ning a cup of wine. “With
Zhou Li’s assistance, after you enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect,
you won’t suffer much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suffer much?” Ning
raised an eyebrow. Baiwei shook his head. “It’s a major sect,
after all, with more than ten thousand Zifu Disciples. Given how many
disciples it holds, I imagine you can guess for yourself how frenetic
its internal struggles can be. The disciples are all divided into
various levels. As a new disciple, if there is no one there to help
you, I imagine that you will be treated worse than any of the
others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently. It
was true. Wherever there were people, there would be competition. A
major sect with more than ten thousand disciples…its internal
struggles would indeed be quite fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With Zhou Li’s
assistance, it will be a bit easier for you to rise.” Baiwei
continued, “But afterwards, you’ll still have to rely on yourself
and to fight for yourself! Remember; opportunity comes to those who
fight for them. Don’t show any mercy. Although I don’t know the
details of the situation, this sort of major sect surely must run
internal competitions so as to divide up its disciples into various
levels. In these competitions, do your best to be number one and
become one of the most core disciples of the Skysplitter Sword Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely!” Ning
understood this principle. In the Ji clan, he would be given the best
of everything, but in an outside school, he would have to fight for
whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you are free,
please come visit Stillwater City often. I can introduce some friends
to you.” Northmont Baiwei smiled. “The path of Immortals is an
incomparably difficult one. With powerful friends by your side,
things will become much easier. Look…take a look at this person who
just came in.” Ning turned to look through the window.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi had
personally gone to greet this person. The person she had gone to
greet was an extremely handsome young lord, who had more than ten
people in his entourage behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His bearing is
extraordinary,” Ning said with praise. “This person’s name is
Hun Wuji.” Baiwei said solemnly, “He is a formidable fellow. As
for his clan, the Hun clan, it is an enormous merchant clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Enormous merchant clan? A merchant? Generally speaking, most of the
major powers were sects, schools, or tribes; there were very few
organizations solely dedicated to trade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hun clan is no
ordinary merchant clan.” Baiwei continued, “Their business is
spread throughout virtually the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. Although
they can’t be considered to stand at the very top-tier of the Grand
Xia Dynasty, here in Stillwater Commandery, they are one of the top
two major merchant clans! And this clan rose to power only a few
short millennia ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, startled,
“Just a few thousand years ago?” Baiwei smiled. “The founder of
the Hun clan was named Hun Tianyou. He’s still alive. You tell me;
how long ago was this clan established?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. Only
a few thousand years had passed since the clan had been established,
and yet it was already one of the top two major merchant clans of the
entire Stillwater Commandery, and had spread its trade throughout the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty. This was indeed astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This founder and
Patriarch of the Hun clan, Hun Tianyou, was originally an orphan and
a gangster.” Baiwei laughed as he spoke. “He himself gave himself
the surname of ‘Hun’, symbolizing his original status as a
gangster. He then gave himself the name ‘Tianyou’, meaning
‘protected by heaven’, as he was born as an orphan and kept alive
through the grace of the heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Patriarch of
the Hun clan…he wasn’t that talented in the path of cultivation.
He became a Zifu Disciple early on, and then began to truly focus his
attention on building up his business. Who would have imagined that
he truly would rise to such heights?” Baiwei sighed, moved.
“Audacius yet prudent, and viciously decisive…this person truly
is a towering, heroic figure. In fact, when he was merely a Wanxiang
Adept, he managed to employ three Immortals to have them kill his
enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He employed three
Immortals?” Ning was speechless. Baiwei continued, “This
Patriarch of the Hun clan relied on his tremendous wealth to forcibly
increase his power to his current level, that of a Primal Daoist.
Don’t be fooled by the fact that the entire Hun clan only has a
total of two Primal Daoists. The amount of wealth they
possess…compared to your enemy, Snowdragon Mountain, they are
unfathomably more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. For
someone at the Wanxiang Adept level to be able to employ three
Immortals…one could imagine how wealthy he now was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hun clan is one
of the most supreme clans within our Stillwater Commandery.” Baiwei
continued, “For them to reach such a level in just a thousand
years…how formidable! As for that Hun Wuji who just entered? He’s
the most prominent person in the younger generation of the Hun clan.
He is viewed with great favor by the Patriarch of the Hun clan.
Naturally, we need to be friends with people like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within the borders
of our Stillwater Commandery, the Hun clan is like the embodiment of
the God of Wealth.” Baiwei continued, “On the path of Immortals,
wealth is very important as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood; magic treasures, unique items, and even spirit-pills were
all important. “Borrow from the strengths of those around you,”
Baiwei continued, “And make the strengths of others your own
strengths. Only then will you be able to walk further along the path
of Immortals!” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I trust
that in the future, you will definitely become a towering figure
somewhere.” Baiwei seemed to speak with great confidence. Ning
replied, “Brother Baiwei, you treat me so well that I truly don’t
know how to repay you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei immediately
waved his hand. “This is what my father taught me; when you
encounter someone you view as worth making friends with, you must
treat them with sincerity! As for those not worthy of being your
friends? I, Northmont Baiwei, wouldn’t even glance at them.” Ning
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must be sincere
to your friends. Otherwise, you won’t be able to make any true
friends. Then, when a critical time comes, none of those ‘friends’
will help you,” Baiwei said. “Well-spoken,” Ning concurred.
Only when you treated others with sincerity would they treat you with
sincerity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you make friends
everywhere, you will naturally build up your own strength. Ji Ning,
make some powerful friends. Within, you will rely on your own power;
without, you will have your friends to assist you. In the end, you
might end up becoming the leader of the Skysplitter Sword Sect,”
Baiwei laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, laughter rang
out from outside. “Hahaha…” The laughter was quite loud, and it
echoed throughout the giant main hall of many kilometers. Upon
hearing this laughter, the face of Northmont Baiwei, who had been
chatting happily with Ning, immediately sank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei.”
That deep voice echoed in the main hall, filling every corner of it.
Quite a few of the guests within the various luxurious rooms at the
ends of the corridors that hung in midair were listening with
curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want for your
good friend, ‘Ji Ning’, to enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect?”
That deep voice continued to laugh wildly. “Hahaha, unfortunately,
I can tell you something right now…and in fact, I can tell this Ji
Ning kid directly. Ji Ning, kid, forget about ever being permitted
into joining the Skysplitter Sword Sect!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Fox!”
Baiwei suddenly roared out with anger. “What is it?” That deep
voice let out a chuckle. “Are you upset?” Baiwei growled and
cursed, “You shameless thing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You do seem quite
pissed.” That deep voice chuckled with delight. “Unfortunately,
your good friend won’t be able to enter the Skysplitter Sword
Sect.” “Hmph.” Baiwei no longer paid the outside world any
attention. That deep voice said a few more mocking lines, but upon
seeing that Baiwei was no longer responding, it fell silent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned, then said
in a soft voice, “Brother Baiwei, who was that?” Baiwei’s face
was exceedingly ugly to behold right now. He hurriedly said, “Ji
Ning, I truly apologize. I didn’t expect that your affairs would be
disrupted because of me. That person is named Northmont Fox. He, too,
is a member of our Northmont clan.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father is
Northmont Blacktiger. His father is Northmont Yin.” Baiwei shook
his head. “His father and my father are competing to become the
next Marquis of Stillwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sucked in a cold
breath of air. The next Marquis of Stillwater? It seemed Northmont
Blacktiger’s status was incredibly high. No wonder, as soon as
Baiwei camed to the Carefree Caverns, Wanxiang Adept-level
cultivators and monsters had come to greet him in such a grand
fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His father and mine
have always been opposing each other. Thus, this kid always is
struggling against me as well.” Baiwei let out a snicker. “His
father, Northmont Yin, truly is a heroic, towering figure, as a
crafty as a fox. Northmont Yin gave his son the name ‘Fox’, but
all his son is capable of is petty scheming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly do have to
apologize. Because of me, you won’t be able to enter the
Skysplitter Sword Sect,” Baiwei said. “For Northmont Fox to
proclaim it so boldly means that he definitely must be confident of
being able to ensure it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt resignation
in his heart. Just now, he was fantasizing about how viciously he
would ‘compete’, but in the blink of an eye, it had all
disappeared. He immediately said, “This is just a small matter.
Stillwater Commandery is such a large place, and there are so many
schools here. There are many different places I can choose from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Baiwei
continued, “How about this. Later, I’ll arrange for information
regarding the various schools of Stillwater Commandery to be brought
over. You can choose for yourself. When the twelth lunar month comes,
the various schools will all be accepting new disciples. You can go
by yourself. If I don’t go with you, I can’t cause any problems.
Given your abilities, it will be very easy for you to join a school.
To be honest, my actions just now were unnecessary to begin with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, “We
were just a bit unlucky to have encountered this Northmont Fox.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So what if he didn’t
enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect? Even the ancient spirit of the
underwater estate, after seeing that Ning had mastered the Rainwater
Sword Domain, had treated him in a markedly different way. Ning felt
certain that it would definitely be simple for him to choose any
other schools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Knock, knock, knock. A
knocking sound at the door. “Brother Baiwei. I am Hun Wuji.” A
voice rang out from outside. “Wuji, please, come in. Why even
knock?” Baiwei hurriedly called out. The door opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome, refined
young man entered. This Hun Wuji had a smile which made anyone who
saw him instantly feel well-disposed towards him. He immediately
said, “If you were the only one here, Baiwei, of course I would’ve
just entered. But Brother Ji Ning is here as well; I didn’t wish to
be discourteous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, come, this
is my good friend, Hun Wuji.” Baiwei said. “Young master Wuji.”
Ning clasped his hands in salute. “Brother Ji Ning. I heard your
name just now.” Hun Wuji clasped his hands in response. “Then you
heard me being made a fool out of.” Baiwei felt resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, shortly
after I sat down nearby, I heard what was going on between you,
Baiwei, and with Fox.” Wuji sat down as he spoke. “Northmont Fox
truly is a fool. How many schools does Stillwater Commandery have? He
has a bit of a relationship with the Skysplitter Sword Sect and might
be able to prevent Brother Ji Ning from entering that sect, but what
about the other sects? For a school, accepting new disciples is a
major matter. There are so many schools in Stillwater Commandery that
are seeking new disciples, and he’s only able to affect a few of
them. In the end, Brother Ji Ning is still going to be able to enter
a school.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, as you said,
he is a fool. He always jumps at any opportunity to make trouble for
me.” Baiwei shook his head. “It is as though by doing so, he can
demonstrate superiority over me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the
extravagant music from outside changed. The sound of a zither
suddenly rang out. The gentle, watery strumming sounds were
soul-stirring to the extreme.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning, Baiwei,
and Wuji all looked towards the outside. Ning stared down into the
wide hall. He immediately sat a green-clothed woman who was seated in
front of a zither, plucking at its strings. For a moment, the entire
hall seemed to have grown quiet. Only the sound of the zither could
be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Such a beautiful zither
song.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Such a beautiful
person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, upon seeing the
green-clothed woman, instantly felt that she must be one of the fairy
maidens of legend. The sound of her zither made Ning’s soul feel
incomparably comfortable. Her skill in the Dao of the zither had
clearly reached a level of mastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the song was
finished, the hall remained quiet for quite some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it’s actually
Zither Fairy.” Baiwei sighed in praise as he spoke, then instructed
the servant waiting outside, “Go, have Zither Fairy come over.”
“Yes.” The attendant outside replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
going to invite Zither Fairy to come accompany us? The price you will
pay won’t be a light one.” Hun Wuji glanced towards Baiwei in
surprise, but Baiwei simply said, “Earlier, because of me, Brother
Ji Ning’s chance to enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect was ruined. I
wish to make sure that Brother Ji Ning will be happy today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
surprised as well. He was inviting Zither Fairy over, just for him?
And from the sound of it, the price would be significant. “Brother
Baiwei, you truly are too courteous,” Ning said hurriedly. “That
was just a minor matter, not worthy of discussing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…” That
deep voice rang out yet again. “Zither Fairy’s skill in the
zither is truly at an incomparably miraculous level. Zither Fairy,
would you be willing to accept an invitation to come to the room of
myself, Northmont Fox?” This voice echoed throughout the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s room.
Bang! Baiwei, in his anger, smashed his beastskull goblet against the
ground. Grinding his teeth, he said, “What sort of an unlucky day
is this? I’m stepping in dogshit repeatedly.”

Chapter 7 - Treasure Auction
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per Northmont Baiwei’s
orders, the maidservant outside had exited the corridor and had
arrived within the main hall. Upon hearing the words, ‘Zither
Fairy, would you be willing to accept an invitation to come to the
room of myself, Northmont Fox’, she couldn’t help but be stunned.
She hurriedly called out, “Mistress, young master Northmont Baiwei
also wishes for Zither Fairy to go to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi, next to
Zither Fairy, was stunned upon hearing this. Moments later, she
laughed. “Young master Fox, young master Baiwei is also inviting
Zither Fairy to pay a visit,” Miss Ziyi called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Northmont
Baiwei, you are also going to invite Zither Fairy?” That deep voice
instantly grew smug. “Why were you so quiet and silent about it? I
didn’t hear you say a thing. If you are going to invite someone
over, you have to show some sincerity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could I be as
boorish and uncouth as you?” Northmont Baiwei replied with a cold
laugh. The two were in different rooms, and were both calling out to
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the other rooms
were young masters of major tribes, superb figures of major clans,
and Raindragon Guards. Still, they didn’t intervene, just watched
with amusement. After all, Northmont Baiwei and Fox were both highly
ranked young masters of the entire Stillwater Commandery. They were
both descendants of the Northmont clan, and their parents, Northmont
Blacktiger and Northmont Yin, were truly incredible figures. They
didn’t dare to rashly intervene in a struggle between two such
young masters. After all, in Stillwater Commandery, the Northmont
clan was the strongest power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Fox?”
Ning looked through the window, towards the direction of that voice.
Ning could see a figure in a private room that was a few kilometers
away. Northmont Fox appeared quite muscular, and he had sideburns on
his face. His appearance was very different from his name. He had the
frame and musculature of a dominating tyrant, but his eyes were cold,
sinister, and arrogant, like those of a viper’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei
appeared ardent and heroic. Northmont Fox, however, appeared cold and
sinister. They were two diametrically different people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miss Ziyi.”
Northmont Fox called out in his loud voice, “This Northmont Baiwei
hasn’t reserved Zither Fairy in advance, has he?” “He has not.”
Miss Ziyi, standing on the ground below, shook her head. “Since
there is no reservation, and since both myself and Northmont Baiwei
are both inviting Zither Fairy over, let this be determined by who
offers the highest price.” Northmont Fox’s voice echoed
throughout the entire hall as he called out, “I’ll offer ten
taels.” Instantly, every single private room within the giant hall
became filled with lowered whispers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. Ten
taels? Ten taels of what? As for Northmont Baiwei, he said with cold
fury, “I’ll offer fifty.” “Hahaha, Northmont Baiwei, you are
going to compete against me? Are you able to win?” Northmont Fox
called out from his distant room, with a voice filled with braggado,
“I’ll offer a hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s room.
Ning, Wuji, and Baiwei were all seated. Wuji lowered his voice and
said, “Brother Baiwei, if we are going to get into a bidding war, I
can assist you.” But Northmont Baiwei just laughed and said, “No
need. In terms of wealth, how could Northmont Fox compare with you,
you little God of Wealth? Inviting Zither Fairy over is only a minor
matter. Normally, just ‘one’ is enough. To spend too much is just
foolishness. He’s now offered a hundred; as long as I raise the
price again, Northmont Fox definitely won’t make another
counter-offer. By then, I’d have to suffer the consequences.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why aren’t I
hearing anything from you?” Northmont Fox mocked from far away.
Northmont Baiwei called back, “Congratulations, Northmont Fox. You
have invited Zither Fairy to accompany you for the price of a hundred
taels of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Liquefied elemental
essence? Ning was stunned upon hearing this. So the ‘one’, ‘ten’,
and ‘hundred’ taels they were referring to…were in reference to
liquefied elemental essence! Liquefied elemental essence was the
refined, concentrated version of natural, elemental energy. One could
rely on it to engage in training, without causing any stress to the
body. Previously, Ning had acquired a a very thin layer of liquefied
elemental essence from the stone room in the mine, most likely just
ten or fifteen kilograms worth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had used up only a
third of the essence, less than five kilograms. This had allowed him
to breakthrough to the Zifu Disciple level and also establish and
stabilize as an early-stage Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten or fifteen
kilograms was comparable to the entire wealth of the Ji clan,” Ning
mused to himself. “A hundred taels of it…that’s roughly
equivalent to five kilograms. Just now, in order to have Zither Fairy
accompany him, Northmont Fox casually tossed out a sum that is
equivalent to half the total wealth of my Ji clan? He is too…too
insane.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred taels of
liquefied elemental essence.” Hun Wuji nodded. “That’s roughly
equivalent to an Earth-ranked magic treasure. Given Northmont Fox’s
temperament…for him to throw away an Earth-ranked magic treasure
for the sake of making trouble for you is his limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
speechless. Well, then. After killing Adept Xu Li, he had only
acquired three Earth-ranked magic treasures. He had worked so hard to
accumulate that amount of wealth…but compared to exalted young
masters of the Marquisate of Stillwater, he was indeed quite far off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the room,
Northmont Fox’s voice continued to ring out with arrogance and
smugness as Miss Ziyi was introducing Zither Fairy to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Northmont Fox’s
room. Northmont Fox was currently seated alongside three other men.
As for their servants and followers, they had a separate room of
their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that I would run into Northmont Baiwei here, today.” Northmont Fox
held a beastskull goblet in his hand, his red tongue gently lapping
at the wine as he laughed sinisterly. “I just so happened to
acquire a powerful retainer recently, as well as an extremely rare
magic treasure. What happened just now was just the starter course.
Today, I’m going to anger him so badly that he vomits blood. I’ll
make it so that he will never forget this day. I’ll make him feel
terror in his heart whenever he sees me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let us
congratulate you in advance, young master Fox.” “Let’s watch as
Northmont Baiwei is embarrassed.” The other three in the room, Zhou
Li included, all cupped their hands in a salute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Northmont
Fox laughed joyfully. Right at this moment, Zither Fairy came in, and
Fox immediately said, “Come, Zither Fairy, come. Please come in and
sit.” “Thank you, young master Fox.” Zither Fairy’s gentle
laugh made Fox feel as though even his bones had relaxed. This made
him feel all the more pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a beautiful woman
accompanying them, Northmont Fox’s room was filled with laughter
and amusement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Northmont Fox
looked down at the main hall, and at the dais that was beginning to
be set up. “It should almost be time for the treasure auction.”
Fox waved his hand, and a grand seal suddenly appeared within it. He
handed it to the neaby Zither Fairy and said, “Zither Fairy, this
grand seal is a top-grade Mortal-ranked magic treasure, ‘Grand
Mountain Seal’. It was forged from an actual mountain, the ‘Grand
Mountain’, which was refined into this seal. Its true value comes
from the fact that it is merely a Mortal-ranked magic treasure, but
in terms of power, it isn’t inferior to any ordinary Earth-ranked
magic treasures. Thus, this Grand Mountain Seal is absolutely a
top-grade Mortal-ranked magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade
Mortal-ranked?” “It is extremely rare to find a top-grade magic
treasure. Young master Fox actually has a treasure like this?”
Everyone nearby, Zhou Li included, was surprised. Zifu Disciples were
capable of using Mortal-ranked magic treasures, while Wanxiang Adepts
were able to use Earth-ranked magic treasures. But generally
speaking, they only used low-grade or middle-grade treasures. It was
extremely rare for someone to be in possession of a high-grade
Earth-ranked magic treasure. As for top-grade…that was incomparably
rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll deliver it
over now.” Zither Fairy rose to her feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dais rose up within
the main hall below. Miss Ziyi’s voice echoed throughout the entire
hall: “It is now time for the treasure auction. Today, our Carefree
Caverns has prepared eighteen treasures, each with extraordinary
attributes. Anyone willing to purchase them can buy them. The high
bidder wins the auction!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s room.
Ning, upon hearing this, couldn’t help but feel startled. Wasn’t
this identical to auctions on Earth? So a place like this, where
Immortals and Devils gathered, also had so-called ‘treasure
auctions’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, honored
guests, if you have any precious treasures which you are willing to
sell, you can bring them out as well and allow everyone to bid on
them as well,” Miss Ziyi said with a laugh. “Just now, young
master Northmont Fox has brought out a top-grade Mortal-ranked magic
treasure, ‘Grand Mountain Seal’, and has made it the nineteenth
magic treasure up for bidding in our treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei! I
wonder what sort of treasures you might have for sale?” That deep
voice echoed out once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a slap in the
face. He was directly striking Baiwei on the face! Within his room,
Baiwei had an extremely ugly look on his face. Hun Wuji was frowning
as well. “This Northmont Fox actually managed to procure a
top-grade Mortal-ranked magic treasure. Things are now a bit
troublesome. I can bring out quite a few Earth-ranked magic
treasures, but in terms of rarity, they can’t compare with this
Grand Mountain Seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell what
was going on. For these young masters, when they competed in
treasures, what they cared the most about was rarity! Although
Earth-ranked magic treasures were much more expensive, in terms of
rarity and uniqueness, they were far inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dogshit luck. I
truly stepped into dogshit today.” Baiwei gritted his teeth. “I
didn’t expect that not only would I run into this fellow, he
actually came prepared. I’ll have to endure. Next time, I will get
him back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwei,”
Ning said, “I also happen to have a top-grade Mortal-ranked magic
treasure.” “Oh?” Baiwei and Wuji both looked towards Ning in
surprise. A top-grade Mortal-ranked treasure wasn’t something you
could simply buy with money; the reason why they were ranked
top-grade was because they were truly few in number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please take a look.”
Ning waved his hand, and the dragon pearl appeared within it, along
with four dragon scales. The dragon pearl had the illusory dragon
swimming about in the middle of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A dragon pearl!”
Baiwei and Wuji were all startled. Wuji then cried out in
astonishment, “A four-sided formations that matches with a dragon
pearl? Judging from how complex the formation is…this is
inconceivable. What formation is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation!” Ning gave his response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation?” Northmont Baiwei said in astonishment, “Our
Northmont clan has a grand formation called the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, but that is a Heaven-ranked grand formation, and an
extremely powerful Heaven-ranked grand formation at that. So there is
actually a Mortal-ranked version of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation as well? It was actually simplified? This truly is
unbelievable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuji quickly said,
“Such a grand formation…this is far rarer than what Fox has
brought out. In addition, Fox just brought a single grand seal. What
you have here, Brother Ji Ning, is a formation! It is far more
valuable.” The value of a formation was, indeed, higher than that
of other magic treasures of the same level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The way in which Hun
Wuji looked at Ning had changed. Top-grade Mortal-ranked magic
treasures weren’t so easily procured. It seemed as though this
friend of Baiwei’s, Ji Ning, was quite extraordinary as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
truly willing to sell it? A treasure like this…after selling it, it
will be hard for you to regain it,” Baiwei said. “Yes, sell it.”
Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan now had the
protection of the Marquis of Stillwater; naturally, it no longer had
any need for the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. In addition, a
grand formation like this one required five people controlling it in
order to unleash its full combat power. The reason Ning had brought
this formation to Stillwater City was because he planned to sell it,
and thus acquire a large amount of Mortal-ranked flying swords, which
would vastly increase the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Brother Ji
Ning, I’m not going to waste too many words on effusive thanks.
This time, I’m going to give Northmont Fox a good slap across the
face.” Baiwei’s own face was turning ruddy with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei,
can it be that you, the young master of Northmont Blacktiger’s
estate, don’t have any treasures?” That deep voice once more rang
out mockingly. Baiwei laughed softly, then called out in a loud
voice, “Miss Ziyi, I have a formation here. Although it is quite
ordinary, it is still naturally far superior to what Northmont Fox
produced.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere in the
hall instantly changed slightly. Everyone understood that young
master Northmont Baiwei was finally standing up and preparing to
deliver a vicious slap to his opponent’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only, would his slap be
a loud, ringing one?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That would depend on
whether or not this formation treasure was superior to the Grand
Mountain Seal.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure auction
had begun, amidst this strange atmpshere. One treasure after another
was brought out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first treasure.”
Miss Ziyi held up a tri-colored stone, which then levitated into the
air. “14.5 kilograms of ‘Flame Flint’ which can be used to
forge magic treasures. The lowest bid must be at least 130 taels of
liquefied elemental essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“150 taels of
liquefied elemental essence.” Wuji was the first to speak out. The
other guests in the various rooms looked towards Wuji, and all of
them called out warmly, “Oh, young master Wuji is present as well?”
“Young master Wuji!” They all addressed him in a clearly warm and
familiar manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“160 taels.” A
clear voice rang out from a distant room. It was a rainbow-clothed
maiden. “180 taels.” An icy voice from a grim, callous-looking
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s private
room. Ning just sat there, listening to these people bargain. He
glanced backwards towards Hun Wuji. “Brother Wuji, you aren’t
going to bid any further?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
this is your first time here so you don’t understand.” Wuji
laughed as he explained, “The small-scale treasure auctions which
the Carefree Caverns normally offer will have treasures that start
off at a price which is quite a bit lower than its true value. I
offered 150 taels, and that’s a price at which I can definitely
make money off this transaction. But as for a price of 200 taels,
that’s a bit too much; only those who truly need it would raise it
to such a price. I’m a merchant; I don’t like doing business at a
loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. So
the first bid Wuji had made was for the sake of earning money.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, after you
grow more familiar with Wuji, you’ll understand; this young God of
Wealth is always thinking about how to make more money,” Northmont
Baiwei said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“290 taels.” A
hoarse voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long silence. “Anyone
offering a higher bid?” Miss Ziyi glanced at the private rooms in
every direction. “Since there are no other bids, then this Flame
Flint will go to young master Qu of the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next is the second
treasure…” Miss Ziyi quickly began to introduce the next treasure
to the audience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Qu is a
disciple of the Trueflower School as well as a Raindragon Guard.”
Baiwei gave a quick introduction regarding the man. “He is already
a peak Wanxiang Adept, and his future prospects are unlimited. Upon
becoming a Primal Daoist, he will truly become a major figure here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The others
within this hall might not have statuses as exalted as that of
Northmont Baiwei or Northmont Fox, but they were all extraordinary
figures who were able to converse and interact with Baiwei and Fox as
equals. After all, although these two young masters of the Northmont
clan had exalted statuses, they were still young and didn’t truly
command great power yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why the
Carefree Caverns treated them so respectfully was because behind the
two of them were Northmont Blacktiger and Northmont Yin, who were
candidates to become the next Marquis of Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That person just now
was Miss Leshan of the Meng clan,” Baiwei said. “Within the Meng
clan, she is viewed with great favor. Her training speed has been
extremely fast, and in sixty short years, she has become a peak
Wanxiang Adept. The Meng clan is one of the major clans within our
Stillwater Commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The Meng
clan? He glanced at the distant maiden, who appeared to only be
twelve or thirteen years of age. She was one of the true, proud
scions of the Meng clan. Compared to her, Meng Jun, Roch, and Xin
were far inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One treasure after
another was sold off, most of which were meant for Wanxiang Adepts to
use. Although occasionally, there were some appropriate for Zifu
Disciples, those were all extremely rare items. Of the people
present, aside from Baiwei, Fox, and some other young masters with
extraordinary backgrounds, most had already reached the Wanxiang
Adept level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the items that
our Carefree Caverns prepared, two were not bid on, while the other
sixteen have all been sold. Now, the auction for the top-grade
Mortal-ranked ‘Grand Mountain Seal’ of young master Northmont Fox
will begin. This treasure is a grand seal that was forged from the
peak of Grand Mountain. If it was an Earth-ranked magic treasure, it
wouldn’t be particularly precious; its value lies in the fact that
it is a Mortal-ranked magic treasure which can be used by Zifu
Disciples. When a peak Zifu Disciple uses this treasure, it can
transform back into its original form of the Grand Mountain and crush
downwards with astonishing force. There is no minimum price; everyone
can now commence bidding on the treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi was laughing
as she spoke. The treasures which guests occasionally brought and
auction off always started off at a minimum price of zero. The amount
that was bid would be the amount the guest would receive; the
Carefree Caverns never asked for any commission at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s private
room. “I wonder how much this Grand Mountain Seal is worth?” Ning
mused to himself. After having visited the Treasure Hall of the
underwater estate, Ning didn’t hold the Grand Mountain Seal in high
regard. If it had been left in the Treasure Hall, the first master
probably would’ve just classified as something which only barely
qualified as a high-grade Mortal-ranked treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty to a hundred
taels of liqueified elemental essences,” Wuji said. “This is the
most common of all grand seal-type magic treasures. Although it is
top-grade, it isn’t all that precious; it can just barely reach the
price of a normal Earth-ranked magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty five taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various rooms were
all making their bids. Soon, a final price was reached; 110 taels of
liquefied elemental essence. Ning stared through the window towards
the distant Northmont Fox, who had a smile on his face. Clearly, he
was pleased with this price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next is a formation
technique, one offered by young master Northmont Baiwei,” Miss Ziyi
called out loudly, a look of joy on her face. “The Marquisate of
Stillwater has a famous Heaven-ranked formation, the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. As for this formation, this is the simplified
version of that ancient, mighty formation. Although it is simplified,
our Carefree Caverns have ascertained that it was simplified in a
nearly perfect way; it is at the utmost peak of Mortal-ranked magic
treasures, a top-grade amongst top-grades.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of Miss Ziyi,
a dragon pearl and four dragon scales suddenly emerged, hovering
before her. Everyone present had extraordinary eyesight, and as they
stared towards these items, astonishment appeared on quite a few
faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ziyi!” Northmont
Fox had an extremely ugly look on his face. He barked out, “I’ve
never heard of there being such a thing as a simplified Mortal-rank
version of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. Are you sure you
assessed it correct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi just replied
in a loud voice, “Our Carefree Caverns is willing to pay two
hundred taels of liquefied elemental essence to purchase this grand
formation.” Upon these words coming out, Fox’s face instantly
blackened, and he no longer said a single word. The reputation of the
Carefree Caverns was beyond reproach; if the Carefree Caverns was
willing to make an offer, that meant that it had an extremely good
opinion of this formation technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am willing to
offer 210 taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“230 taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right away, the price
began to rise. In his own room, Ning felt his heartrate begin to
quicken; this was his treasure, after all. Slowly, the price
continued to tick upwards….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“360 taels!”
Suddenly, the clear voice of a young child rang out. Instantly,
everything fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, the price
had risen very slowly to 300 taels, and this had been viewed as a
hard ceiling to break through. For someone to suddenly increase the
price to 360 taels was surprising. And secondly, the person who had
made the bid had the voice of a child…this caused quite a few
people to look towards him. Even Ning couldn’t resist from turning
to look. He saw that in a distant, private room, there was a child
that appeared to be six or seven years of age. He had a golden
necklace around his neck, and he was nibbling on a bone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Boy of Universal
Fire?” Baiwei was surprised. “He came today as well?” Wuji was
also shocked. As for Ning, he narrowed his eyes. ‘Boy’? This was
the first time he had encountered an Immortal practitioner who looked
like a child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
according to stories, this Boy of Universal Fire is a reincarnated
Immortal,” Baiwei said in a soft voice. “He is one of the most
indisputable masters of formations, and he stands at the very top of
the field amongst those of us in the younger generation. He has
trained for less than thirty years, but he is already a peak Wanxiang
Adept. In addition, he primarily focuses his efforts on analyzing
formations, and has only spent a bit of effort on training. And yet,
he has already reached such a level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Less than thirty years
of age? A peak Wanxiang Adept? Who only spent a small part of his
attention on training? And was a reincarnated Immortal? Ning was
truly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any higher
prices?” Miss Ziyi looked towards the surrounding rooms, but
unfortunately, there were no further bids. “Then this Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation will go to the young master of Universal Fire,”
Miss Ziyi said in an extremely respectful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Boy of Universal
Fire, gnawing on his bone, instantly began to laugh loudly. “To
condense such a complicated grand formation in such a manner, yet
maintain so much of its essence…it has been a long time since I’ve
seen something like this. I truly am curious as to which formations
master carried this out. I bought it for just a bit over three
hundred taels…what a bargain, what a bargain!” The Boy of
Universal Fire waved his hand, and the dragon pearl, along with the
four dragon scales, flew straight towards him. At the same time, he
also tossed out some black marks, sending them flying towards Miss
Ziyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the dragon
pearl and the dragon scales entered his grasp, the Boy of Universal
Fire instantly began to peruse them. The distant Ning, upon seeing
this, sighed to himself. Even though this person was a reincarnated
Immortal, he was also insanely dedicated to what he did. If he
wasn’t, could he have reached his current level of accomplishments?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” In the
other room, Northmont Fox had an increasingly ugly look on his face.
He had lost. His Grand Mountain Seal had only sold for 110 taels,
while the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation had sold for 360 taels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s room.
An attendant brought in a stack of black marks, placing them on the
table. The attendant then bowed respectfully and left, closing the
door as he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is 360 taels,”
Baiwei said, delivering the stack of black marks to Ning. Ning saw
that there were three slightly larger marks and six slightly smaller
marks. On the large marks, there were the words, ‘Heavenly
Treasures Mountain of the Grand Xia Dynasty’ and ‘Exchangeable
For 100 Taels’. On the small marks, there were the words, ‘Heavenly
Treasures Mountain of the Grand Xia Dynasty’ and ‘Exchangeable
For 10 Taels’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single
commandery city controlled by every single Marquisate of the world
has a Heavenly Treasures Mountain within,” Baiwei explained. “This
elemental mark is used quite commonly. It is also a magic treasure
that requires someone to be at least at the Xiantian level to bind.
After binding it, you can carry it with you and use it to buy other
magic treasures, or trade for liquefied elemental essence. Liquefied
elemental essence is something which every single major power in the
entire world delights in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. At Earth,
one of the trillion Lesser Worlds, it could be said that gold was a
common commodity used for trade. In this vast world, however, the
refined extract of the natural elemental energy of the world was what
was used as a common currency. By relying on them, one could avoid
having to waste precious amounts of time in slowly, bitterly
gathering in energy. However, not even Immortals could be wealthy
enough to use liquefied elemental essence nonstop; at most, they
would use them to help in making breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve caused you,
Brother Ji Ning, to lose a grand formation. I truly feel ashamed,”
Baiwei said quickly. “But I acquired this liquefied elemental
essence,” Ning replied hurriedly. “As for the grand formation, it
was of no use to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei shook his head.
“It’s not the same. Such a rare formation can easily be exchanged
for liquefied elemental essence, but it will be very hard for you to
use elemental essence to buy another such formation. Still, I have to
admit, this feels excellent. Today, Northmont Fox wanted to cause
trouble for me. He first ruined our plans of having you, Brother Ji
Ning, enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect, and then he insisted on
taking away Zither Fairy. At last, I’ve given vent to my anger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given Northmont
Fox’s temperament, I imagine that he’s going wild with rage by
now,” Wuji said with a laugh. “Right.” Just thinking of this
made Baiwei begin to laugh even more happily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grinned as
well…and in his heart, he was calculating how many flying swords he
might be able to purchase with these 360 taels of liquefied elemental
essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I left Swallow
Mountain, I first made a trip to the underwater estate. I passed the
second level of the Wargod Hall and traded for the Nine Yang Swords
Formation.” Ning was pondering to himself. The Nine Yang Swords
Formation was an extremely good match for the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]; although Daoist Threelives had individually ranked those
nine swords as only being high-grade, in the modern era, they would
all definitely be considered top-grade. In addition, all nine swords
came from the same source, and they just so happened to form a
formation base for the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and so the
power of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had naturally
increased significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to acquire
some more high quality flying swords that come from the same source.
I can’t hope for top-grade Mortal-ranked flying swords like these
Nine Yang Swords, but I have to try and procure high-grade or at
least middle-grade swords.” Ning understood that there was a direct
link between the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] and
the quality of his magic treasures. The higher quality those magic
treasures were, the greater the power of the formation would
naturally become.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the current power
of his divine sense, his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would be
capable of unleashing tremendous combat power. His true killer
attack, the [Starseizing Hand], was something he would only use at
the most critical moments; under ordinary circumstances, he would
rely on the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to make his way
through the world.

Chapter 9 - Ji Ning Reveals His Fierceness
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having vented
their anger through the treasure auction, Northmont Baiwei, Hun Wuji,
and Ji Ning were now chatting and laughing amongst themselves. They
were in quite a good mood. Time passed on slowly, and night began to
approach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Midnight comes, and
the time for the betting arena comes as well.” From outside the
window, the voice of Miss Ziyi could be heard. Ning looked out
through the window, only to see that the hall had now become
completely empty. There were two jewels placed in a corner of the
room, and Miss Ziyi was standing in one of the corners while
speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The betting arena
duels are absolutely berserk,” Baiwei said as he looked out the
window. “Most of the people here are Wanxiang Adepts, and
astonishingly talented ones at that. They will send some of their
Zifu Disciple followers or retainers to engage in battle against
other Zifu Disciples and Zifu-level Diremonsters. The masters on each
side will engage in a gamble on the duel.” Ning sighed to himself
as he listened. What a tragic sight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal
cultivators and monsters who engage in the betting arena duels
participate for the sake of survival or for the sake of acquiring
treasures,” Baiwei said. “However, a duel must be between two
competitors at the same level; there absolutely would never be, for
example, a Wanxiang Adept battling a Zifu Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared down at the
hall below. An Immortal practitioner with a sword on his back had
entered the hall, and a red-haired man had entered as well. The two
stared at each other, their eyes filled with murderous intents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They first walked to
stand before the two jewels at the two opposite corners of the hall,
filling them with their elemental energy and causing each to radiate
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal
cultivator under the command of young master Qu is a peak Zifu
Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Diremonster
under the command of Miss Leshan is also at the peak Zifu level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Miss Ziyi called out in
a loud voice, “Activate the grand sealing formation.” Whoosh!
Instantly, a watery, rippling layer of light that was nearly a
kilometer in circumference suddenly appeared within the hall,
covering the Immortal practitioner and the red-haired man within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qu Yihang, I think
you had best admit defeat obediently. Otherwise, not only will you
lose your money, you will also lose your man!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Just wait and
you’ll see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Voices rang out from
the two private rooms…and the battle below them instantly began.
The red-haired Diremonster instantly transformed into a strange,
four-hooved monster of fire. Its body was covered with armored
scales, and it howled as it charged towards the Immortal practitioner
while belching forth fiery light from its mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vermin, accept
death.” The sword-wielding Immortal practitioner let out a cold
laugh. Swish! The sword on his back instantly flew out, and as it
slashed through the air, it left a rainbow-colored scar through the
air…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched the battle
progress beneath him. He nodded to himself. “The Immortal
practitioner should be the winner.” After having battled for some
time, the Diremonster let out a grief-stricken bellow, then
collapsed. The Immortal practitioner’s face was ashen as well; he
had been forced to execute a forbidden technique in order to achieve
this victory. However, in the end, he had won. Previously, his
master-uncle, Qu Yihang had told him that so long as he won, he would
help him become a inner disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” The
Immortal practitioner had excitement in his eyes. Although he had
used a forbidden technique, he hadn’t used it for very long. In a
year or so, he would be fully recovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha….” Young
master Qu immediately began to laugh. As for Meng Leshan, she had an
ugly look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Ning’s private
room. Baiwei said with a laugh, “Meng Leshan and Qu Yihang are both
dazzling, outstanding talents. Both of them have joined the
Raindragon Guard as well. Rumor said that while on a mission for the
Raindragon Guard, the two formed a grudge against each other. Outside
Stillwater City, the two would most likely be plotting each other’s
deaths. Within the city itself, they are still going all out to harm
each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Much like you and
Northmont Fox, actually,” Wuji said with a laugh. “Hahaha, yes,
just like me and Northmont Fox,” Baiwei replied with a loud laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuji looked towards
Ning. “Brother Ji Ning, although these betting duels appear casual,
in truth, many mysteries hide within. You have to select a
particularly astonishing individual at the Zifu Disciple level…but
the more talented an expert is, the less willing they will be to risk
their lives. Thus, it’s actually quite difficult to arrange for
these betting duels. Both sides have to come up with a way to recruit
someone, and if they lose, not only will they lose money and their
fighter, they will also lose face. Sometimes, if they grow desperate
due to their losses, they might even personally join the field of
battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personally join the
field of battle?” Ning was surprised. These Immortal practitioners
all had extraordinary statuses; they would personally join and fight?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s so
surprising about this? These geniuses rose to prominence through
combat to begin with. When enraged, they will personally join the
field of battle. Every year or two, there will be Wanxiang Adepts,
unparalleled geniuses all, who will fight a duel to the death here in
the Carefree Caverns. If someone dies, no one can be blamed for it!”
Baiwei continued, “But of course, aside from those who have grudges
against each other, most are just trying to win some money through
using the servants and retainers under their command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example,
myself,” Wuji said with a laugh. “I have quite a few servants and
retainers. I can send them down to engage in betting duels, and the
stakes for each duel must be at least two hundred taels of liquefied
elemental essence. I can make quite a bit of money in this manner.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood
that although Hun Wuji and Northmont Baiwei were two of the more
amiable figures amongst these exalted young masters…they were still
figures of high status. They had high standards. It was precisely
because they thought well of Ning that they were willing to treat him
as an equal and as a friend. To them, ordinary Zifu Disciples were
nothing more than retainers or servants; why would they care about
their deaths?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some time later. More
than ten betting duels had already been carried out, and the
atmosphere of the entire hall had become noticeably more heated and
wild. There was currently a very tall and muscular Fiendgod Body
Refiner standing in the middle of the hall. As a Zifu-level Fiendgod
Body Refiner with a divine ability, he possessed astonishing combat
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, everyone,
I’ve won six rounds in a row. It seems that the ‘spiritfruit
wine’ for today’s betting duels will be mine for the drinking.”
A chubby-faced, big-eared youth in a private room was laughing
merrily. “Is there anyone else? As long as you can beat my
subordinate, you will gain three hundred taels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Su-Su! You’ve won
enough. Have your man go down.” A deep voice rang out. Instantly,
Ning turned to look; the speaker was Northmont Fox. Fox flashed a
fierce glance towards Ning, giving him a long stare, then grinning
with a clearly wicked idea in mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
He had overheard quite a few things today, and now understood that
these young masters couldn’t quite be considered the
movers-and-shakers of the Commandery. The truly top-tier figures of
Stillwater Commandery were the likes of Northmont Blacktiger.
Northmont Fox? Ning didn’t fear him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The hall
suddenly trembled. A two-meter tall horned man with massive muscles
and azure skin strode into the hall, his every footstep causing it to
shake. His eyes radiated with azure light as well. Upon seeing him,
every single person understood…that this was a Diremonster! Normal
people could rarely reach the height of six meters, much less be
horned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant, muscular,
horned Diremonster strode to the two jewels in the corner, then
filled them with his elemental ki and his divine power. “Fiendgod
Body Refiner, Ki Refiner. A dual refiner.” Miss Ziyi, standing in
the corner, immediately made this report. “Both are at the peak
Zifu level. A Diremonster under the control of young master Fox.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The grand
sealing formation once more lit up, and the Diremonster stared
directly towards that Fiendgod Body Refiner cultivator. “Die,
then.” The azure-skinned, horned Diremonster let out a loud roar,
transforming into a rhinoceros with a single horn that was more than
thirty meters tall. Its entire body then radiated with light, and the
body of the Monoceros once more swelled, transforming to sixty meters
in height. The enormous Monoceros…it stared at its opponent as
though he were an ant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The Monoceros
moved as fast as lightning, intending to trample its opponent. Whap!
Whap! Whap! After three exchanges of blows, the Fiendgod cultivator
had been trampled to the point of having only half his body left. He
immediately called out in a high voice, “I admit defeat!” Only
then did the azure-skinned Monoceros come to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one side perished or
admitted defeat, that represented the end of the battle! If one
insisted on forcibly killing someone who had surrendered, one would
be punished with a fine equal to ten times the stakes of the bet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrr…” The
Monoceros raised its head, letting out a growl, then transformed into
mist before recondensing into that azure-skinned, horned man who was
six meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei.
Three hundred taels. Dare you engage in a betting duel with me?”
The distant Northmont Fox pointed from his window towards Baiwei. “I
know that you are as cowardly as a mouse, and won’t possibly dare
to engage in a betting duel. Hahaha…as cowardly as a rat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of his
laughter was so repugnant and vile. Ning now finally understood why
some people would personally go enter the arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that Northmont Fox would be here today. If I did…I would never have
allowed him to act so arrogantly for so long.” Baiwei gritted his
teeth, so hard that they were at the point of splintering. He was an
incomparably proud person; how could he not be enraged after being
mocked repeatedly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Wuji, do you
have any powerful retainers present?” Baiwei looked towards Wuji.
Wuji was like a young God of Wealth; he often relied on betting duels
to earn money. Naturally, he had some formidable retainers under his
command. Nodding, he said, “I do have a powerful retainer amongst
the servants I brought today. However, I truly do not feel confident
in his chances. That Diremonster retainer which Northmont Fox brought
out is a Fiendgod Body Refiner with a divine ability; he truly is
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well.
Monsters were powerful to begin with, and those who trained as
Fiendgod Body Refiners were even tougher to deal with, much less
those who also had divine abilities. Their combat power was at a
level higher than even Jadechild had been at. Generally speaking,
those with such a great level of power would disdain from serving as
retainers and engaging in betting duels. However, this person was a
Diremonster who had definitely been captured and tamed; thus, he must
have been forced to obey the order to go take part in a betting duel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what,
let’s give it a try,” Baiwei said. “Alright,” Wuji nodded.
“Attend me.” Baiwei called towards the servant outside, then
waved his hand and produced three hundred taels worth of marks, then
tossed them over. “Let’s bet on a duel.” The servant nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a black-robed
cultivator entered the hall. He stared coldly towards his opponent,
underwent the test, and was verified to also be at the peak Zifu
level in power. “Kill him!” From far away, Northmont Fox let out
a roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That six-meter tall,
azure-skinned and horned man stared at the black-robed cultivator,
then roared, “You are dead.” And then, it once more transformed
into a towering, massive Monoceros, then executed its Heavenly
Transformation divine ability and increased in size yet again, to
sixty meters in height! Its entire body filled the area with a savage
aura, causing the corners of the eyes of the black-robed cultivator
to crease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A stupid cow.” The
black-robed cultivator let out a cold laugh. Whoosh! A black fog
appeared out of nowhere in the area around them, filling the entire
area, including that Monoceros. The only thing that could be seen
within the black fog was an enormous, rainbow-colored serpentine
phantom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, die!”
The enormous Monoceros wildly charged and trampled about. The black
fog swirled around it, and the massive phantom serpent also coiled
around the Monoceros, causing its body to crackle and pop. Its body
was beginning to rot, and its bones quickly became visible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bangbangbang…”
The Monoceros rampaged about, its power seemingly great enough to
shatter the skies and overturn the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, I….”
Suddenly, a miserable scream rang out. BANG! An explosive sound…and
the black fog dispersed, along with the illusion of a serpent. The
enormous Monoceros stood there in the hall, vestiges of blood and
gore visible beneath its feet. Its body was completely rotted away,
and thick white bones could be seen on its back. Still, quite soon,
in just a few breaths, its body completely healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei. Is
that all you have to show?” Northmont Fox arrogantly mocked him yet
again. “I’m so very sorry…but your three hundred taels of
liquefied essence is now mine. I would now like to propose a
challenge of six hundred taels of liquefied essence…dare you
accept?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silence. Complete
silence. The entire hall had fallen silent, and nobody said a thing.
Although they weren’t afraid of Northmont Fox, they truly didn’t
have any Zifu-level experts who were capable of battling that
Monoceros monster. Everyone was waiting to see how Baiwei would
respond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s private
room. Baiwei stared towards the outside, his gaze narrowing. “Nine
hundred taels! I’ll wager nine hundred taels on a bet with you.
Dare you accept it?” Northmont Fox was continuing to shout
provocatively. He wanted to seize this opportunity to deeply
humiliate his old foe. His father, Northmont Yin, strongly encouraged
him to suppress Northmont Baiwei whenever Fox had the chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuji didn’t say
anything. He didn’t have any retainers who were more powerful than
the monster. Baiwei’s veins began to protrude from his face, and he
muttered to himself, “Endure, endure, endure…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me go.” Ning
suddenly rose to his feet. “I will go kill that rhinoceros
monster.” “You?” Wuji and Baiwei both stared towards Ning in
astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way. Ji Ning, if
you train for a few more years, it will be simple for you to kill
him, but you’ve only trained for ten or so years to date,” Baiwei
said, shaking his head hurriedly. “You can’t take this risk.”
But in his heart, he couldn’t help but feel slightly moved; he
understood that Ning simply couldn’t watch any longer, and wanted
to fight on his behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
outside. Nine hundred taels of liquefied elemental essence? What he
lacked the most right now was liquefied elemental essence; upon
killing the rhinoceros monster, he should acquire quite a bit of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.
Killing him?” Ning let out a chuckle. “That will be as easy as
killing a chicken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuji and Baiwei were
both stunned. These words were simply too dominating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Then I’ll
bet against him. If we win, the liquefied elemental essence will be
yours, Brother Ji Ning!” Northmont Baiwei felt incomparably
excited.

Chapter 10 - The Monstrous Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, you
are willing to risk yourself for me. I truly don’t know what I…”
Northmont Baiwei looked at Ning, then said hesitatingly, “You know,
let’s just forget it. Although Northmont Fox is going too far, it’s
not a big deal if we just endure it for a time. In the future, I’ll
just seek out an opportunity to avenge myself.” When he recollected
how savage that rhinoceros Diremonster was, Baiwei was worried for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to say
anything further. The liquefied essence will go to me upon winning,
right? That’s enough,” Ning said with a laugh. Baiwei opened his
mouth, wanting to say something, but nothing came out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’m
completely confident.” Ning cracked his lips into a wide grin.
“Excellent!” The nearby Hun Wuji looked at Ning. “Brother Ji
Ning, we will wait here for you to drink with us when you return.”
Ning nodded, a fierce light flashing through his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time…would be
the first time he would reveal his power in Stillwater City. Since he
had come to Stillwater City, then it was time for him to truly show
off what a ‘monstrous talent’ he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he had already
decided to join a school, and since there were so many elite members
from many schools present, Ning had come to his decision. He was no
longer going to hide himself and conceal his power. He had trained in
seclusion in the Swallow Mountain region for ten-plus years; he had
concealed enough. In Stillwater City, what he needed was reveal as
much of his prowess and talent as he could; he needed for the various
schools to view him as a priceless treasure! To make the various
powers all view him as someone tremendously important! Only then
would he be able to ascend beyond the clouds in the azure sky!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to embark on
this path, then he would embark on this path as a genius. The path of
a monstrous genius!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A rhinoceros
monster?” Ning looked through the window towards that savage,
massive rhinoceros Diremonster. “Nothing more than a stepping stone
for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attend me.” Baiwei
once more summoned the servant, then handed over nine hundred taels.
At the same time, he instructed her to take Ning to engage that
Monoceros in a duel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maid looked in
astonishment towards Ning. Within the hallway outside the room, she
had seen for herself how savage and mighty that rhinoceros monster
was. This delicate, handsome youth in front of her was going to
battle against that rhinoceros monster?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
maidservant didn’t dare say anything; she immediately led Ning
towards the outside. “Brother Ji Ning, we shall wait here for your
victorious return!” Baiwei and Wuji both rose to their feet,
watching as Ning left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” The
Whitewater Hound, resting on the ground, rose to his feet as well as
he looked at Ning. Still, the Whitewater Hound knew very well…that
Ning had killed Adept Xu Li with but a single stroke. Kill this
rhinoceros monster? Ning shouldn’t have any problems at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head,
glancing back towards him, then nodded. And then, Ning departed. Ning
headed out through the hallway, following after the maidservant.
There were some other attendants in the hallway as well. They all
looked towards Ning, a mixture of curiosity, grief, sympathy, and
pity in their eyes. As they saw it…this handsome, delicate youth
was probably a retainer who was being sent to his certain death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei, are you
quivering in fear?” That deep voice once more called out mockingly.
“Northmont Fox, have that Diremonster under your command prepare
for death!” Another voice, a clear one, rang out from the other
room. “In addition, Northmont Fox, let me tell you something. Even
if you occasionally acquire a powerful retainer, you should be
modest. The more arrogant you are, the more miserable your defeat
will be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bullshit!”
Northmont Fox instantly grew enraged. Northmont Baiwei just
snickered. “Shortly afterwards, you’ll have to swallow your own
pile of crap.” The voices of the two young masters of the Northmont
clan echoed in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he had
already departed his corridor and arrived within the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Northmont Baiwei
actually has a subordinate he can send out? Can it be that he feels
confident that his subordinate will be able to overcome that
rhinoceros monster?” A rainbow-clothed maiden looked downwards from
her window.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone dares to
battle against that rhinoceros monster? Who is it?” A white-robed
young master looked downwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” The Boy of
Universal Fire, still gnawing on that bone, looked downwards as well.
Although he had earlier been focusing on analyzing his new formation,
the betting duels was the most lively part of the night, and they
didn’t go on for too long. Naturally, he elected to watch them as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it? I refuse
to believe that he has a subordinate that can kill my rhinoceros
monster.” Northmont Fox stared downwards as well. All of them were
staring towards that corridor, and soon, they all saw a youth dressed
in fur enter the main hall, under the guidance of that maidservant.
The youth had a smile on his face, as though this was naught but a
game.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is Ji Ning.”
Zhou Li, next to Fox, spoke out. “That good friend of Northmont
Baiwei’s.” “Good friend?” Fox instantly began ro roar with
laughter, and his voice filled the entire hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei, do
you truly have no subordinates left? You actually asked your good
friend to personally enter the fray? As I recall, this friend of
yours wanted to join the Skysplitter Sword Sect. A young fellow who
is just about to enter a sword sect…has actually come out to battle
against this rhinoceros Diremonster, who is in possession of a divine
ability? He’s throwing his life away. I’m so very sorry, but it
seems your 900 taels will be mine, yet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You laugh quite
loudly, but you’ll be crying soon enough,” Baiwei said with a
cold laugh of his own, off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formidable figures
within the private rooms all stared down at Ji Ning. Upon hearing
that Ning was Baiwei’s friend, they all mused to themselves that
given Baiwei accepted him as a friend, he must certainly have some
extraordinary attributes. Although he appeared to be a youth, the
younger one appeared to be, the more one needed to be wary of that
person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please come.” Miss
Ziyi looked at Ning. “This jewel is for testing your divine
strength, while this one is for testing your elemental ki. Prior to
the betting duel, you must have your basic level of power tested. It
is absolutely forbidden for a Wanxiang Adept to battle against a Zifu
Disciple, or something similar. If it does happen, then the Carefree
Caverns will take the life of the cheater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
immediately filled those two jewels with his Crimsonbright divine
power, as well as his elemental ki. The two jewels radiated with
light which was far weaker than the previous opponents had generated.
The light that emanated from the elemental ki test was particularly
dim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Miss Ziyi
looked towards Ning in surprise, then called out in high voice, “The
Immortal practitioner who Northmont Baiwei has sent out is a dual
refiner, both a Ki Refiner and a Fiendgod Body Refiner. As a Fiendgod
Body Refiner, he is at the late Zifu stage. As a Ki Refiner, he is at
the early Zifu stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An uproar in the
audience! “Elemental ki at the early Zifu stage?” “Only a late
stage Fiendgod Body Refiner?” “Not even at the peak of the Zifu
stage; is he suicidal? This is insane.” “No wonder he wishes to
enter a school; his elemental ki is only at the early Zifu stage. He
is indeed a highly suitable candidate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formidable figures
seated above, upon hearing Ning’s level of power in these two
aspects, all began to shake their head and sigh. Prior to this, they
had felt hopeful regarding Ning’s chances of victories, but now, it
seemed clear that the youth beneath them was throwing his life away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate the sealing
formation.” Miss Ziyi gave the order. Around them appeared that
giant barrier of light. Ning gave the light barrier a glance, then at
Northmont Fox, who was watching far away, up above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, you are dead
for sure! Even if you have a slightly stronger Fiendgod Body Refining
technique, you are only at the late Zifu stage. You actually want to
compete against the rhinoceros monster I command? You are committing
suicide. You probably won’t even have the chance to beg for mercy!”
Fox was incomparably brash right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just prepare your
second opponent for me,” Ning said with a laugh. Northmont Fox was
startled momentarily, but then he bellowed with rage, “Such
audacity. Monoceros, go and kill this punk!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere
instantly grew tense. In the private rooms above them, Wuji and
Baiwei were feeling concern for Ning, while Fox was hoping for Ning’s
death. Others were all watching this play out with amusement. Still,
in their hearts…they felt that Ning’s chances for survival were
simply too slim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The
six-meter tall, azure-skinned, horned man instantly transformed into
an enormous Monoceros. Immediately afterwards, its entire body began
to emit a blurry light as it once more transformed, this time into a
sixty meter tall colossus. It had already completely executed its
Heavenly Transformation technique to the utmost; its current level of
power and speed could be described as incomparably astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to die.”
The rhinoceros monster galloped forward, its enormous legs causing
the hall to tremble with each step. As for Ning, two Darknorth swords
appeared out of nowhere into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant rhinoceros
monster instantly charged towards Ning, its enormous hooves slamming
and crushing down towards Ning, but missing each time. “Whoosh!”
The Darknorth swords in Ning’s hands transformed into lines of
rainwater, slashing past one of the giant hooves. Instantly, blood
splattered out, falling down like the rain. One of the rear hooves of
the rhinoceros had been completely severed. It had been charging at
high speed forward, and it instantly collapsed to the ground, its
momentum carrying it to roll forward and slam directly against the
grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A colossal,
mountain-shaking collision. Even the grand sealing formation
trembled, a few ripples appear as it blocked the Monoceros monster
which had lost a leg. The female attendants outside the grand sealing
formation, along with Miss Ziyi, had been badly startled upon seeing
the Monoceros charge towards them. They knew, rationally, that it
couldn’t touch them, but they still took a few steps back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rear hoof of the
Monoceros flew straight towards it, once more connecting with the
trunk. “Growl….” The Monoceros rose to its feet, staring at
Ning, a hint of dread and nervousness in its eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silence! All of the
private rooms above them had fallen silent. Fox’s eyes were wide as
he stared downwards. Everyone could easily tell who held the
advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how massive the
Monoceros monster was, its hooves were enormous, yet tremendously
quick. It was actually extremely hard to dodge its trampling
attacks…but Ning had done so easily. Clearly, Ning’s agility was
exceptionally formidable, far above that of the Monoceros. In
addition, and more importantly, Ning’s swordplay was particularly
powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to the
magic treasure protecting the body of the Monoceros, after using the
Heavenly Transformation technique, the body of the Monoceros was
incomparably tough. And yet, its rear hoof had been chopped out with
one blow? The power of this sword technique…was absolutely…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What no one realized
was that Ning’s divine will was controlling his Darknorth sword. At
this point in time, Ning’s divine will was actually a bit more
stronger than even that the power of a peak Zifu-stage Fiendgod Body
Refiner. When matched with the ‘Dao Domain’ level of swordplay
and executed with the Darknorth swords, which were more powerful than
ordinary Mortal-ranked magic treasures to begin with, how could the
power of the blows not be astonishing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you going
to admit defeat yet?” Ning glanced at the distant, towering figure
of the Monoceros. There was a huge difference in size between the
two, but at this point in time, the Monoceros’ aura was clearly far
feebler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admit defeat? It
isn’t so easy to kill a Fiendgod Body Refiner. Even if you chopped
me a hundred times, I wouldn’t die.” The Monoceros was entering a
berserk state. “Kill him, kill him!” Northmount Fox roared from
above, and the Monoceros raised its head, glancing at him. “Don’t
worry, Master.” The Monoceros stared straight at Ning, its eyes
seeming to emit flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since this is the
case…then I will send you on your way.” Ning held his Darknorth
swords in his hands, leisurely strolling forward. “Growl…” The
Monoceros bellowed, once more charging towards Ning, its savage aura
filling the heavens and seeming to contain the power to topple the
mountains. As long as he could step on, strike, or even brush against
Ning, Ning’s body would probably explode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…in
terms of technique and comprehension, the difference between the two
was simply too great. “Die,” Ning said. His entire body
transformed into a line of rainwater and slashed outwards. Whoosh…the
thick neck of the Monoceros monster was slashed through. Ning flew
upwards past him as blood sprayed wildly everywhere. The body and the
head of the Monoceros had been completely cut into two pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotuses.”
Ning willed it. BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having reached a
new level of power as a Fiendgod Refiner, the amount of fire and
water Ning could control had clearly increased significantly. If he
was to reach the Celestial Fiendgod level, then most likely his
control over fire and water alone would be enough for him to easily
slaughter a Primal Daoist, without him needing to use any other
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Waterflame Lotus
after another appeared out of nowhere in the surrounding area, slowly
swiveling. Each one of them were at least thirty meters in diameter.
In total, twelve Waterflame Lotuses had bloomed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Monoceros
which had just been decapitated by Ning, its body and its head were
still in two locations. Its head fell between two Waterflame Lotuses
and was instantly ground down by them. The Waterflame Lotuses
continuously swiveled, crushing and destroying its body. The
completely defenseless head was completely crushed into smithereens,
but even after transforming into dust, it continued to be assaulted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other ten
loti, they surrounded the entire enormous body of the Monoceros.
Although there were parts of it that weren’t completely surrounded,
there was no way for the remaining parts of it to reform into a whole
in this situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grind!” Ning stood
there, within the enormous hall. His twelve giant Waterflame Lotuses
bloomed, and the petals of the lotuses swiveled, wildly grinding down
the enormous body of the Monoceros, slaughtering it and preventing it
from reforming. Naturally, this meant it didn’t have a chance to
admit defeat either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene, both bloody
and beautiful, caused the entire hall to fall silent. Ning just stood
there…and then, he raised his head to look towards Northmont Fox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you to
prepare a second subordinate.” Ning laughed calmly, as casual and
as relaxed as he had been when he first entered the hall.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 11 - The Battle Which Brought Fame
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” Back
in the private room, Northmont Baiwei’s face was red from
excitement. By his side was Hun Wuji, and his eyes were also filled
with shock and delight. “I truly didn’t expect that Brother Ji
Ning would be able to execute that rhinoceros monster with such
ease,” Wuji said. “Those movements…that swordplay…he is truly
inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei nodded
hurriedly. “Formidable.” Baiwei was grinning so widely that his
face threatened to split apart. He immediately shouted loudly,
“Northmont Fox, I told you earlier that you were spouting crap.
Now, you’ll have to swallow your crap back down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox’s face
was ashen. Both the actions of the seemingly ordinary youth below him
as well as the words of Baiwei caused his heart to clench. He felt
extremely miserable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How formidable. What
formidable swordplay!” Young master Qu stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to
effortless execute that rhinoceros monster? Was that a divine
ability? Or pure swordplay?” A black-robed youth frowned as he
stared down towards the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Boy of Universal
Fire, that child who appeared six or seven years old and who had a
golden necklace around his neck, had a look of deep contemplation on
his face. He stared downwards at Ning, in the hall beneath him. “That
sword technique…such power. It shouldn’t be a divine ability!
Given how miraculous his swordcraft is…can it be that he has
already reached the Dao Domain realm? That seems unlikely; he’s
merely a Zifu Disciple. It’s rather unlikely that he could’ve
reached such a high level of comprehension. But that sword…? Can it
be that I was seeing things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
quite a few formidable figures present, Ning had executed his sword
technique too quickly. Only the Boy of Universal Fire had been able
to just get a vague sense that perhaps Ning had reached the ‘Dao
Domain’ level in swordplay…but even he didn’t dare to feel
confident about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand sealing
formation vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal
practitioner which Northmont Baiwei sent out…was victorious!”
Miss Ziyi called out in a clear voice, and then she looked towards
Baiwei. “Are you willing to continue accepting further betting
duels?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning,
standing near her, spoke out instead of Baiwei. Baiwei, within his
private room up above, was startled. He hurriedly sent to Ning,
“Brother Ji Ning, you wish to continue?” Ning sent back, “As
long as Northmont Fox is willing to send someone out, then we’ll
keep betting against him. Don’t worry. It’s already quite
incredible that he was able to send out a rhinoceros monster. I
imagine it will be quite hard for him to send out anything more
powerful. And, even if he does…I am confident in being able to kill
it. As for the stakes…you can add the 900 taels of liquefied
elemental essence I won on top of the stakes as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mentally
transmitted voice was filled with absolute confidence. He himself had
already actively told Fox to prepare a second person; how could he
choose to retreat now? “Fine.” Baiwei’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Fox, my
good brother, Ji Ning, is down there awaiting your challenge. Weren’t
you bragging quite fiercely earlier? As for the stakes…I’m
willing to accept 900 taels, or even 1800 taels! I’m just afraid
that you aren’t!” Baiwei snickered as he spoke, his eyes filled
with disdain and contempt. The words Baiwei had said, as well as the
manner in which he had said them, when matched with that look in his
eyes…these things instantly caused the distant Fox to be utterly
enraged. His face turned red and swollen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox’s face
looked ghastly. He glanced at several of his nearby friends, then
said in a low growl, “I’ve suffered such humiliation…I am
definitely going to slaughter that one named Ji Ning.” Zhou Li
shook his head and said, “To kill Ji Ning…that will be hard. This
person’s agility techniques are shocking, and his swordplay is
exceedingly formidable. Even the rhinoceros monster who had used a
divine ability was executed…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t
completely flawless.” Another person nearby, a blue-robed,
middle-aged man spoke out. “His divine ability is merely at the
late Zifu stage, and his elemental ki is only at the early Zifu
stage. His abilities as a Ki Refiner are so weak as to be negligible;
he’s only able to bring out his close-quarters-combat techniques in
a fight. Thus, as long as you prevent him from drawing nearby, you’ll
have won half the battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox’s eyes
lit up. Right. This Ji Ning was only skilled in close combat. As long
as one didn’t let him draw near, then his defeat would be nigh.
“Attend me,” Northmont Fox immediately commanded. “Have the
Whitewitch come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox said to his nearby
friends said, “This Whitewitch was offered to me by the White
Warlock Sect. I had planned on enjoying her slowly, but after
suffering such humiliation…I can’t be bothered with personal
enjoyment. Although this Whitewitch is somewhat weaker than the
rhinoceros monster, she perfectly counters this Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The White Warlock
Sect?” Everyone nearby, Zhou Li included, was stunned. The White
Warlock Sect…this wasn’t a sect that was located within
Stillwater Commandery. It currently desired to be permitted into
Stillwatery Commandery, and it had offered a witch to Northmont Fox
as a tactic. Zhou Li and the others naturally didn’t dare to say
too much about this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a barefoot woman
walked in. She was dressed in a white robe that was hemmed with
flowery patterns, and had long black hair that fell to her buttocks.
She had a pair of dazzling, bewitching eyes, and she exuded an
indescribable magnetism. Her gaze was fixed upon Northmont Fox’s
figure, and Fox felt a fire build in his loins as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an exceptional
specimen.” Fox ground his teeth, then said, “Whitewitch, your
White Warlock Sect gave you to me. Your life, your everything…it
all belongs to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your slave
understands. Your slave belongs entirely to you, Lord.” The
Whitewitch responded in a soft voice, so gentle it seemed to be
caressing his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox nodded. “That kid
named Ji Ning, standing there in the hall below us, killed that
rhinoceros monster under my command. Now, I have a feeling of rage
that I must give vent to. I order you…to go kill this Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your slave is to go
kill Ji Ning?” The Whitewitch, who had been calm this entire time,
was instantly stunned. Previously, she had been with the other
servants in the other private room. Through the window, they had
watched everything happen below them. She knew exactly how formidable
this Ji Ning was! She knew that in terms of power, she was quite a
bit weaker than even the Monoceros. As for Ji Ning…she had no
confidence in being able to defeat him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the White Warlock
Sect had sent her here, they had done so in order for her to entice
and mesmerize Northmont Fox!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Fox frowned.
“Are you not going to go? Then what’s the point of keeping you!”
“No.” In her heart, the Whitewitch secretly cursed this man, who
was of the primary lineage of the Northmont clan, for his
viciousness. She hurriedly said, “Young master, it isn’t that
your slave isn’t willing. It is that your slave doesn’t feel
there is any chance of killing this Ji Ning. Your slave personally
witnessed him killing the rhinoceros monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fox shook his head.
“You don’t need to worry about this. This Ji Ning is extremely
weak as a Ki Refiner; his only strength lies in his close combat
abilities! So long as you can make him unable to draw near you, you
will definitely win. As I recall, you have a secret binding skill
that is extremely formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewitch gritted
her teeth. That was a technique that was meant for pleasure on the
bed. When she and Northmont Fox had been making love, she had once
made it so that her hair had rapidly lengthened, then tied herself up
with it. At that time, while they were lovemaking, Northmont Fox had
even asked her about her technique, and she had naturally bragged
about it. Who would have imagined that the end result was this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are skilled in
constricting your foes. In addition, your White Warlock Sect is most
famous for your venomous bugs. Amongst them, your technique of
‘Body-Birthing Bugs’ are particularly famous,” Northmont Fox
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewitch’s face
turned ashen. The Body-Birthing Bugs? This was indeed a technique of
the White Warlock Sect that made others terrified upon hearing of it,
but if she were to execute it…if she was lucky, she would only
suffer severe damage to her elemental ki, but if she was slightly
less lucky, she would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whiteweitch stared
at Northmont Fox…she understood that this Northmont Fox fully
intended to have her fight to her death, if that was what was needed
to kill Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can choose to
go. Or, you can choose death.” Northmont Fox’s voice was cold.
The Whitewitch gritted her teeth. “Your slave shall go.” “Good.”
Fox nodded. “The skills of your White Warlock Sect perfectly
counter him. You still have a chance at surviving. Go to the hall and
kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Whitewitch immediately turned and left, her body swaying. As
Northmont Fox watched her depart, a lecherous light flashed through
his eyes. He let out a low sigh. “What a waste of a beauty. Still,
there are plenty of beauties in the world. This Ji Ning, however,
must die. I have to give vent to my rage.” He turned to stare
through the window towards Ning, his eyes filled with savagery now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei.
You just won 900 taels, but now you are going to give them back to
me? Fine. I’ll bet against you again and have you send me those 900
taels back to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall. Ning
stood there by himself, a hint of a faint smile on his face. He was
calm and unflappable. Since he had already decided to reveal his
fierceness…how could a single battle be enough?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
forward. From a staircase up ahead, a barefoot, white-robed woman
came striding down, her long black hair falling to her buttocks. Her
swaying motion as she walked was filled with allure. “She has come
to fight me?” Ning frowned, puzzled. “This woman seems to be more
suited for seduction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewitch walked
to the jewels in the corner, filling them with her elemental ki. Miss
Ziyi called out in a high voice, “The Immortal practitioner which
young master Fox has sent out is a peak Zifu-level Ki Refiner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a Ki Refiner? A
Ki Refiner is at a disadvantage to begin with when facing a Fiendgod
Body Refiner. She actually dares to come?” Ning pondered for a
moment. “She must have a special technique.” Although he was
merely at the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] as a Ki Refiner, the jewels served as a test for the purity
and density of the divine power within his body, then determined his
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since ancient times to
the present day, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had
always been the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Although
Ning was only at the seventh stage, the purity of his divine power
truly was comparable to a late Fiendgod Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!” The grand
sealing formation once more lit up. Within the enormous barrier of
light, only Ning and the Whitewitch remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A lady of a sect of
warlocks, filled with allure. A handsome, delicate-looking fur-clad
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was forced to
come. Please show mercy.” The Whitewitch bowed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just smiled. He
didn’t say anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Suddenly, every
single strand of the Whitewitch’s long black hair, previously
waist-long, emanated with a devilish red light. Instantly, that long
hair began to grow rapidly…and an instant later, it filled the air.
Countless strands of black hair swept all-encompassingly towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Baiwei,
in the private room above, was shocked. “If Ji Ning is caught and
bound, he will be in trouble.” Wuji was nervous as well. “Ji Ning
is skilled in close combat. His elemental ki is only at the early
Zifu stage; the power with which he can control magic treasures is
simply too weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
all-encompassing strands of hair, but just revealed a smile. He knew
what his opponent’s ability was, now. “So she wants to bind me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle rustle rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around
them, rainwater appeared out of nowhere. The rain was very light.
When landing on someone, it felt cool, refreshing, and comfortable.
The countless drops of rainwater instantly filled the entire grand
sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Layered Water
Walls.” Ning’s gaze was focused on the black hair sweeping
towards him. Instantly, one layer after another of incomparably
sturdy curtains of water began to condense. In the past half year,
Ning had developed the [Rainwater Sutra], and he had indeed risen
quite a bit in terms of comprehension and insight. The power of the
‘rainwater’ of his Rainwater Sword Domain had risen the most, and
Ning had furthermore spent a great deal of time focusing on these
curtains of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, he had focused
on developing this ‘Layered Watered Walls’ technique, and in
terms of intricacy, it was nearly comparable to the ‘Rain Line’
technique, except it was meant to pressure and bind his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash slash slash…”
The countless strands of black hair strove to draw close to Ning, but
the layers of watery curtains were incomparably durable and
entangling. This technique of the Whitewitch’s was meant to be used
for pleasure on the bed; while it was exceptionally strong in terms
of binding power, in terms of the innate penetrating power of those
strands of hair, it was very weak. There was no way it could pass
through the Layered Water Walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those countless strands
of hair flailed in midair, effortlessly blocked by the Layered Water
Walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater Sword
Domain!” The Boy of Universal Fire rose to his feet as well. He
tossed that bone to the side of the table, staring down at Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Domain.
Rainwater. Rainwater Sword Domain…a Zifu Disciple who has a Dao
Domain?” All of the formidable figures who had been calmly watching
this battle were now shocked. For someone who was merely at the Zifu
Disciple level to have reached the Dao Domain level, this…this was
something out of the legends! None of them had been this powerful at
the Zifu Disciple level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Zifu Disciple
capable of comprehending a Dao Domain? Oh no…oh no! So many people
are watching here today. When word of this spreads…if the sect
learns that a monstrous genius such as him was refused entrance
because of me…I will be in trouble.” Zhou Li, next to Northmont
Fox, had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The emergence of the
Rainwater Sword Domain had shocked everyone. As for Ning, he stood in
the hall, as calm as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admit defeat. I’ll
give you a path to survival.” Ning stood there, surrounded by
rainwater. He glanced at the distant Whitewitch.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_12___The_Pebble_That_Aro"></A>
Chapter 12 - The Pebble That Aroused a Thousand-Story Wave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewitch, upon
seeing Ji Ning display the might of his Rainwater Sword Domain, felt
her heart instantly turn icy cold. “A path to survival? What path
to survival do I have?” She immediately began to activate the
secret technique of her sect within her body. All of the elemental ki
in her blood, flesh, and essence began to condense, and her entire
body began to emit a bloody glow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within her Zifu,
twelve Gu-Bugs that were hidden there began to move about. The bugs
within the bug nest she kept on her also began to move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” The distant
Ning shook his head. It seemed as though this woman was being forced
by Northmont Fox to fight to the death. Ning immediately prepared to
execute his Waterflame Lotus, planning to send this woman directly to
the Yellow Springs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We admit defeat!”
A deep voice rang out. “Eh?” Ning raised his head, glancing over
in astonishment. Northmont Fox, up in his private room, appeared very
calm. He even grinned towards Ning. “I didn’t expect that today,
I would have the chance to see a genius such as young master Ji Ning.
You are merely an early-stage Zifu Disciple, and yet you’ve already
comprehended a Dao Domain…admirable, admirable. I, Northmont Fox,
am wholeheartedly convinced by my defeat at the hands of young master
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewitch stared
in astonishment towards Northmont Fox as well. She knew exactly how
savage and wild Fox had been previously; he had insisted on her going
all out to kill Ji Ning. But now, in the blink of an eye, before she
had even lost, Fox had admitted defeat? In this battle, she
represented Fox, and Fox was the one doing the betting. Thus, upon
his admission of defeat, the battle ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The long
black hair of the Whitewitch quickly retracted, changing from three
hundred meters to its normal waist-high length.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji Ning
was victorious,” Miss Ziyi instantly called out in a high voice.
The way in which she had referred to Ning had changed; previously,
she had referred to him as ‘the Immortal practitioner who Northmont
Baiwei sent out’, but now, she directly referred to him as young
master Ji Ning. This was because she knew very well what it meant for
a Zifu Disciple to gain insight into a Dao Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Domain was a
level which only Primal Daoists were generally able to reach. For a
Zifu Disciple to be able to comprehend a Dao Domain…anyone capable
of this was a truly monstrous talent, or perhaps even a major power
who had reincarnated. Based on what she had heard regarding people
like this, so long as they survived, they would train in the finest
of Ki Refining techniques, and there was no question that they would
become Primal Daoists!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was said that she
treated Northmont Baiwei and Northmont Fox with care, due to their
family background, she now treated this Ji Ning with the same care
due to his innate, terrifying talent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood…
Primal Daoists were truly influential figures. If one then ascended
to become an Immortal, even the Marquisate of Stillwater would
actively reach out to befriend that person. Such a person would be
capable of influencing the major powers of Stillwater Commandery. A
monstrous talent like Ning…so long as he survived, he would have a
100% chance of becoming a Primal Daoist. As for becoming an Immortal?
The chances for that were extremely high as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, are you going to continue with another betting duel?” Miss
Ziyi smiled towards Ning, and as a fox-spirit, her smile was
dazzlingly bewitching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, after young
master Ji Ning revealed his Dao Domain, who would dare battle him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way for
us to find another Zifu Disciple who has comprehended a Dao Domain.
Anyone we send would definitely lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the betting
duels come to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spiritfruit wine
for this series of betting duels shall go to young master Baiwei and
young master Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughter rang out from
each of the private rooms. Since they didn’t have any grudge
against Ning, why would they wish to offend a monstrous talent like
him? Although these people were elites amongst their various sects,
and although many were Wanxiang Adepts, it was still quite hard for
Wanxiang Adepts to leap to the Primal Daoist level. Actually, they
still weren’t even ware that Ning’s soul had already reached the
‘divine sense’ level. If they did, they probably would be
completely speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that by relying on his Rainwater Sword Domain and divine sense, Ning
had passed even the ‘divine abilities trial’ left behind by
Daoist Threelives, once of the most ancient of individuals who had
been born when the Cosmos were first created. Thus, he had acquired
the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ning
knew that the amount of talent he had displayed today was enough. The
divine ability [Starseizing Hand]…he definitely couldn’t reveal
it to anyone. If he did, he would be courting death! Of course, he
could still use it; after all, given the monstrous talent he had
already revealed, even if he unleashed an attack that exceeded the
expectations of others, onlookers would come up with their own
explanations, such as Ning having learnt some sort of a special
divine ability, or being in possession of a very unique magic
treasure, or that his level of comprehension was very high. In short,
it was normal for a monstrous talent like him to reveal monstrous
levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning.” Northmont Fox was in his distant room, a smile on his face.
He called out in high voice, “Northmont Baiwei and I have always
been at loggerheads. Previously, I offended you, but it wasn’t
because of you, young master Ji Ning; what I did, I did to take aim
at Northmont Baiwei. Still, I did offend you, and I hope you will
pardon me for that. At the same time, I would like to warn you, young
master Ji Ning, that Northmont Baiwei is a two-faced tiger. He’s
quite the faker! Don’t be fooled by him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
giving him a glance. What a Northmont Fox! Formidable! Previously, he
had acted with such red-eyed bravado and arrogance, but now, after
seeing Ning display his Rainwater Sword Domain, it was as though a
bucket of ice water had been poured over his head, waking him up. He
thus immediately stated that his earlier actions were directed
towards Northmont Baiwei, so as to ease the tensions between him and
Ning. At the same time, he also tried to disrupt the relationship
between Ning and Baiwei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And, young master Ji
Ning, if you wish to enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect…there will be
absolutely no problems at all.” Fox laughed as he spoke. Just
moments ago, he had arrogantly stated that Ning could forget about
ever joining the Skysplitter Sword Sect, but in the blink of an eye,
he had changed his tune. Ning mused to himself that one truly
couldn’t underestimate any of the young masters of the Marquisate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Fox, you
truly are shamelessly thick-faced. As for entering a school? Given
the talents of my brother, Ji Ning, he can enter any school he
wishes.” Baiwei immediately began to laugh. “As for you trying to
stir up strife between us, everyone in Stillwater City knows of your
reputation, and everyone also knows what sort of a person I,
Northmont Baiwei, am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only after spending
much time with a person will you understand their heart. You
two-faced tiger, do you think I can’t see straight through your
façade?” Fox let out a cold laugh. Baiwei shook his head. “Oh?
Then I’ll just wait for you to see through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a figure shot
out from one of the private rooms through the window, moving as fast
as a streak of light. The grand sealing formation had already been
dispersed, and the figure flew directly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
at this woman. She seemed to be roughly ten years old, and was
innately endowed with a noble grace. “Young master Ji Ning, my name
is Hu Shui. My grandfather is the leader of the Thousand Rivers
School. Given your talent, young master Ji Ning…as long as you are
willing to enter our Thousand Rivers School, I imagine that even the
Immortal ancestor of our Thousand Rivers School would be willing to
accept you as a disciple.” The beautiful, lithe maiden with
hairpins in her hair laughed as she spoke, and her voice was so
pleasant to the ear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced in
surprise at this young woman named Hu Shui. Thousand Rivers School?
What school was this? He had never heard of it before. He had to
admit, though, the number of schools within Stillwater Commandery
that he knew of could be counted on one hand. He came from Swallow
Mountain, and his experience was rather lacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miss Hu Shui, your
Thousand Rivers School, in our Stillwater Commandery, isn’t even
ranked in the top ten. You wish for young master Ji Ning to join your
Thousand Rivers School? Haha…aren’t you being a bit
presumptuous?” A black-robed man flew down as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
One figure after another immediately flew down, and even Northmont
Baiwei and Hun Wuji flew down as well. Baiwei hurriedly send to Ning,
“Ji Ning, for now, don’t agree to enter any of these schools.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
also understood the principle of not acting impetuously or with
haste. Stillwater Commandery had many schools, and the relationships
between the various alliances and schools could be very complex.
Choosing a school, for him, was a major affair. Naturally, he had to
be cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately looked
at all of the powerful figures. Only some of them were from branches
of major schools; others included members of tribes and sects. Some
just wanted to make friends with Ning. A heroic figure like him…why
wouldn’t they want to befriend him? As for being jealous? Perhaps
in their hearts, they felt a hint of jealousy towards him, but they
all understand that Stillwater Commandery was filled with countless
geniuses. If they kept on feeling jealous of this one or that one,
then they might as well not bother training to becoming Immortals at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone,” Ning
said hurriedly, “I’ve just arrived at Stillwater Commandery a
short time ago. Joining a school is a major affair, and I must
consider it carefully. I’m unable to come to a clear decision in
such a short period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, true. One cannot
be rash with regards to such a major affair.” “Young master Ji
Ning, I am Meng Shan of the Meng clan.” “Young master Ji Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them began to
chat conversationally. Immortal practitioners had astonishingly good
memories, and so Ning quickly learned and memorized everyone’s
names. In truth, there were many figures who hadn’t revealed
themselves prior to this. Ning now met them one by one, and only now
did he truly understand that Stillwater Commandery was a place of
crouching tigers and hidden dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning? Swordplay?”
The Boy of Universal Fire said a few words with Ning as well, then
departed. While leading his servant to leave the Carefree Caverns, he
furrowed his brows, pondering to himself about Ning. “Since he
chose to reincarnate in Stillwater Commandery…if he is the
reincarnation of a major power, then in his previous life, he
should’ve been living within Stillwater Commandery as well. But in
the past few decades, I haven’t heard of any major powers who were
skilled in swordplay who entered the cycle of reincarnation. Even if
they reincarnated, their Immortal friends should be here to welcome
them. Why would they voluntarily wish to join a school?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that an
error occurred in the reincarnation process, and that in his past
life, he didn’t live in our Stillwater Commandery? Or is there some
other reason?” The Boy of Universal Fire continued to ponder this
question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a reincarnated
Immortal, he hadn’t been living for particularly long in this life.
His recollections of his previous life were still hazy and
indistinct. Every so often, a memory would flash past his mind, or he
might suddenly feel that something was very familiar to him! Although
his memories from his past life had yet to completely awaken, his
ability to comprehend formations and understand the Dao had risen at
an astonishing speed. Clearly, he was benefiting from the hidden
memories from his past life. As his strength grew, his memories would
become increasingly clear, until one day, he would completely regain
his past memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were also some truly major powers who would directly awaken their
memories, but that was extremely, extremely difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Fox also went
up to say a few words to Ning. He verbally sparred with Baiwei as
well, and then led his group of servants to depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his carriage.
Fox sat there by himself. He was frowning. He was thinking back to
everything that had happened within the Carefree Caverns, starting
from the very first words he exchanged with Baiwei. He thought very,
very carefully…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fighting against
Northmont Baiwei is one thing. How did this Ji Ning get involved? It
seems as though this person has tremendous potential; in the future,
he might be influential enough to affect the major powers of
Stillwater Commandery, and even the question of whether or not my
father will be able to become the Marquis of Stillwater.” Fox
frowned as he continued to ponder this matter. There were actually
quite a few potential candidates within the Northmont clan for the
position of the next Marquis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the more supporters one would have. Naturally, the greater one’s
chances would then be of becoming the next Marquis of Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh! Northmont
Baiwei actually encountered a monster like him. His luck is too damn
good.” Fox gritted his teeth, then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning bade Hun Wuji
farewell, then followed Northmont Baiwei to the Ninestar Immortal
Carriage once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the carriage.
The Whitewater Hound was lying to the side, while Baiwei and Ning
were both seated. Baiwei’s face was all smiles, and he was
incomparably delighted. He hurriedly said, “Ji Ning, the Rainwater
Sword Domain you displayed this time truly stunned everyone present.
You didn’t see the way Northmont Fox’s face instantly changed. I
understand this punk quite well. Although he’s vicious and
arrogant, he can also change his attitude very quickly. This is one
of his rare strengths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, stay with
me. My estate has many places reserved for guests. This time, you’ve
truly made a name for yourself. There were many people there within
the Carefree Caverns, and news of this battle of yours will quickly
spread to quite a few schools and sects. There will definitely also
be many who will wish for a genius such as yourself to join them. If
you stay in my place, you won’t be disturb. Tomorrow, I’ll
prepare an intelligence report for you which will introduce you to
all of the larger powers within Stillwater Commandery. Naturally,
this will also include information on the various schools. You can
make a good choice based on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled.
“Then I’ll have to trouble you for that, Brother Baiwei.”

Chapter 13 - Northmont Blacktiger
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already late at
night. The light of the crescent moon shone down upon this giant,
ancient city. Within it was a Ninestar Immortal Carriage, wreathed in
fiery flames, which was entering the Northmont Blacktiger Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
“Young master.” The late night guards all called out towards the
carriage respectfully. Northmont Baiwei led Ji Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and his maidservant out of the carriage, and then the Ninestar
Immortal Carriage, without anyone controlling it, entered the estate
on its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Baiwei said with a smile, leading them forward. Ning looked around
carefully. The door they were entering was a side door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How large.” As
they moved forward, the scenery continuously changed, and there were
pavilions and buildings everywhere. Everything was unspeakably
beautiful. “An estate more than ten kilometers in
circumference…this can compare with some of the cities I saw in my
past life on Earth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come into this
garden. This place is where all of our guests stay.” Baiwei was
striding forward atop a series of lotus petals which formed a path
over a large pool of water. There were also all sorts of fishes
around them, and beneath the water there were some luminous pearls.
The light from them caused the entire pool to seem like a jade lake
for Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the
quiet, private courtyards. “Brother Ji Ning, you can rest here for
a period of time. Generally speaking, schools take on new students in
the twelth lunar month,” Baiwei said with a laugh. “Tomorrow, I
will arrange for a book detailing the various major powers of
Stillwater Commandery to be brought to you. You can choose carefully,
and you can also often come out for a stroll and listen to the
conversations going on in the outside world. Only then should you
decide which school to join.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning nodded.
Baiwei continued, “Alright, it is quite late, and I won’t disturb
you any further. If there is anything you need, just instruct the
servants. I will leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This residence was
clearly meant for entertaining guests. It was quite large and quite
roomy, and there were five buildings within this residence itself,
along with twelve servants that could be summoned at any time, all of
them beautiful, flower-like women.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
twelve maidservants all bowed. Their leader was a tall, willowy
Xiantian lifeform. “Prepare my bath for me,” Ning instructed.
“When bathing, I do not wish to be disturbed.” “Yes.” The
tall, willowy woman acknowledged his commands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all Immortal
cultivators possessed extremely good self-control. Even those who
were lustful would only view women as a form of enjoyment. For
example, even someone like Northmont Fox would order the Whitewitch
to her death when he felt it was necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later.
Within the room. Within an enormous bathtub made from slick, polished
rock. Hot air steamed everywhere. Ning lay there within the bathtub,
head resting against a pillow. By his hands was a tray of fruit and
wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” The
Whitewater Hound, resting next to the bathtub, glanced at Ning. “You
shocked everyone today with your exploits, and did so in the Carefree
Caverns, one of the top entertainment venues of the entire Stillwater
Commandery. This news will surely spread quickly. Did you do this
with the intention of…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I intended to
shock everyone today,” Ning said. “The only people I truly have
grudges against belong to Snowdragon Mountain. There are no problems
between myself and the various other major powers. A monstrously
talented youth whom they have no grudges against, who had just
reached the early Zifu stage who wishes to join a sect…they will do
anything they can to get me to join their schools, or to befriend
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for my sole
enemy, Snowdragon Mountain, I don’t know if they are still paying
attention to me. Even if they are…I am currently within the
Northmont Blacktiger Estate. There is nothing they can do to me,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded. “If my predictions are correct,” Ning
said solemnly, “Perhaps tomorrow, Baiwei’s father, Northmont
Blacktiger, will come to pay a personal visit to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
was exceptionally sensitive. He knew right away that there weren’t
any eavesdropping tools or monitoring tools here. This was a place
for receiving guests; if guests were to discover that they were being
monitored, then it would cause tremendous problems. Northmont
Blacktiger naturally wouldn’t act in such a manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dark space. A
tall, muscular, bald man dressed in a black uniform was seated in the
lotus position atop a fiery red boulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slither…” A
giant black serpent, more than three hundred meters long, coiled
around this dark region. This giant black creature looked like a
serpent, but upon taking a closer glance…one would find that it was
completely formed from black flames. Its scales, fangs, and body were
all formed from countless black flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black flames
swirled around this area, and the head of the serpent was close to
that of the bald man. “Eh?” The black-uniformed bald man frowned,
then opened his eyes. His gaze was like thunder, striking fear into
the hearts of men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” He
exhaled, and instantly, the black flaming serpent around him
transformed into countless black flames, wildly surged into his
mouth. He swallowed it all into his stomach. “Baiwei. Come in.”
The bald, black-uniformed made gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaaak. A door
appeared in this dark space, and Baiwei walked in. He said
respectfully, “Father, I have news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This person was the
awe-inspiring potential candidate to be the next Marquis of
Stillwater - Northmont Blacktiger. Someone whose power was truly
capable of shaking the heavens. “Speak,” Northmont Blacktiger
glanced disdainfully out of the corner of his eyes at his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei instantly
recounted with great clarity todays events at the Carefree Caverns.
Blacktiger, hearing this, frowned. “The reincarnation of a major
power?” Blacktiger mused to himself, “If he is a reincarnated
Immortal, he should’ve been received by his friends from his former
life long ago. Why would he choose to enter a school?” Baiwei just
waited to the side quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei,”
Blacktiger nodded lightly. “It is good that you can make a friend
like him. Tomorrow, I will go visit him. It’s late. Go get some
rest.” “Yes,” Baiwei said, then immediately left this dark
space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the darkness,
Blacktiger continued to ponder, a considering look in his eyes. “The
various schools, clans, sects, and Fiendgods…I haven’t heard of
anyone entering the cycle of reincarnation in the past twenty or so
years. However, for this person to have reached such a level at such
a young age…even if he isn’t the reincarnation of a major figure,
he must have encountered some sort of incredible stroke of karmic
luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whooosh.”
Blacktiger no longer considered this matter. He opened his mouth, and
countless flames charged out from it, quickly forming that enormous
serpent of black flames around him once more. This giant serpent
seemed to be quite comfortable within this dark region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next morning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow hung
high in the sky, its light covering the entire Stillwater City.
Within Stillwater City’s Northmont Blacktiger Estate. Within the
residence where Ning was currently located. He was seated in front of
a table which was covered with fruits and wine. Ning’s fingers were
outstretched in a plucking manner, and between them was hanging a
Waterflame Lotus that was constantly swiveling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Water, fire, wind,”
Ning mused softly to himself. “Waterflame Lotus…this is formed
from three different types of the True Meaning of the Dao; that of
fire, water, and wind. They condense and form it. With regards to
water, I have comprehended my Rainwater Sword Domain, but am somewhat
weaker in fire and wind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at his
fingers and the Waterflame Lotus swiveling between them. He focused
on the mysteries contained within, slowly gaining greater insight
into them. At his current level of insight, with but a thought, he
could begin to touch the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a maidservant
ran over from far away. “Hm?” The Waterflame Lotus between Ning’s
fingers disappeared into thin air. “Young master, young master
Baiwei sends word. He will immediately come to visit you, along with
the master of the estate.” The maidservant’s face was filled with
nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The master of the
estate? Ning frowned, then immediately rose to his feet. “Alright.
I understand. You can leave now.” “Yes.” The maidservant
immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The master of the
estate? Northmont Blacktiger? So he really did come.” Although
Ning’s will and resolve was firm, in the face of this potential
next Marquis of Stillwater, he still felt an invisible pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
that had been lying next to him stood up as well. “Come,” Ning
said. “Let’s go welcome him.” He immediately led the Whitewater
Hound towards the doorway. But as soon as he arrived at the doorway,
he saw three figures appear in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person walking in
the center was a bald man in a black uniform who appeared extremely
heroic and imposing. This bald man’s eyes seemed to be as deep as
the abyss, and as he slowly walked over, it seemed as though he was
one with the surrounding universe. An invisible, majestic presence
swept towards Ning, making Ning feel as though he couldn’t even
breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dangerous,
dangerous, dangerous!” Ning looked at this person, but in his
heart, he had an inexplicable feeling of tremendous danger impending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that it
wasn’t because he was in imminent danger; rather, it was that the
person before him simply posed far too great of a threat to him, and
was most likely capable of instantly killing him without giving him
the chance to resist at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he is Northmont
Blacktiger? How could his aura be so powerful and so dominating?”
Ning was secretly shocked. Baiwei was a graceful, handsome young
master. But his father, Blacktiger, was like an ancient Fiendgod who
had been lying hidden for countless ages, filled with inexhaustible
savageness and dominance. The look in his eyes…the way he walked…it
was all filled with ‘savagery’. As he walked over, it was as
though an ancient, primordial beast was walking over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One’s aura was built
up over the course of many years. The fact that the two of them,
father and son, had such completely different auras made Ning feel
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two by his
side…” Ning glanced at them. To one side of Blacktiger was his
son, Baiwei. To his other side was a pale-faced, beardless old man.
This old man had a pair of triangular-pupiled eyes. Even when
smiling, he gave others a sinister, cold feeling. Upon noticing this
old man, Ning immediately realized how terrifying he was as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Blacktiger could be
described as an ancient, primordial beast, then this old man was like
an icy, sinister viper. If one didn’t focus on him, one might not
even notice his presence, but upon focusing on him carefully, one
would discover how frightening he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dangerous!” Ning
sensed how terrifying this old man was as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Blacktiger.
The triangular-pupiled old man. The sense of danger these two made
Ning feel…was incredibly strong. Even that Xue Hongyi who he had
encountered was like nothing more than a weak ant before these two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power. They are
too strong, too powerful. No wonder he is someone capable of becoming
the next Marquis of Stillwater,” Ning said to himself. But of
course, Ning’s soul was extremely powerful, and so he was
superficially able to maintain his calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Blacktiger laughed loudly, and his heroic, noble laughter caused the
surrounding space itself to tremble. “I heard Baiwei praise his
friend endlessly, but I didn’t believe him. Now that I have had a
chance to see him for myself…he truly is extraordinary. A Zifu
Disciple who stands before me without batting an eye? I can count
such figures on a single hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came here to take
a look at you. Not bad, not bad,” Blacktiger laughed. “Today, I
have other matters to attend to, so I won’t tarry. In the future,
after you join a school, you must often come and visit my estate.
Baiwei is lucky to have a friend such as yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Making friends with
Brother Baiwei is also the good fortune of myself, Ji Ning.” Ning
acted and spoke with modesty and respect. Blacktiger laughed loudly,
then departed with the triangle-pupiled old man. The old man gave
Ning a long look, then nodded slightly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Baiwei let
out a long breath. He half-turned, first verifying that his father
had departed. Only then did he completely relax. “It’s been so
many years, but I’m still so nervous whenever I am in front of my
father.”

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_14___Black_White_College"></A>
Chapter 14 - Black-White College
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji Ning, this
book holds records of all of the major powers that are located within
Stillwater Commandery. It is quite detailed.” Northmont Baiwei
waved his hand, and a foot-long book, appearing as massive and as
heavy as a shield, appeared. There wasn’t a single word on the
cover of this book. He handed it directly over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
enormous, shield-sized book. He blinked. “This is too big…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei began
to chortle. “Think about how large Stillwater Commandery is! This
book holds detailed records regarding every single power within
Stillwater Commandery, and it even describes some of the magic
treasures and techniques which the more important Immortal
cultivators of each sect possess.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s as detailed
as that?” Ning was amazed. “I just want to choose a school to
enter.” Baiwei grinned. “I couldn’t be bothered to compile
something, so I just had my estate prepare a copy of the pre-existing
intelligence report regarding the various major powers in the region.
This is classified at a fairly low level. The top-secret version is
hundreds of books long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
All he needed to do was consider which school he was going to join,
but Baiwei had prepared a copy of a full intelligence report. No
wonder there wasn’t even a single word on its cover. “Take it,”
Baiwei said. Ning immediately accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei continued, “I
imagine you will need quite some time to read this intelligence
report. Actually, given your current power, Brother Ji Ning, if you
are to enter a school, you must select one of the absolute best
schools which Stillwater Commandery possesses. Within our Stillwater
Commandery, aside from the Raindragon Guard and the Marquisate, there
are a total of eight supreme powers. I’ll give you a brief
explanation of them. Later, when you read the book, you’ll be able
to move through it much more quickly.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These eight supreme
powers are divided up as into three major schools, three major
tribes, and the two major churches,” Baiwei said seriously. “They
all have incomparably long histories, and their roots are
unfathomably deep. Although some of the other powers might have
Immortals guarding over them, compared to these eight supreme powers,
they are still lacking in some manner. Their Immortals might not be
strong enough, or their foundations might be a bit unstable, or they
might not have existed long enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three major
schools refer to the Black-White College, the Skysplitter Sword Sect,
and the Hundred Flowers Fairyland,” Baiwei said. “These three
schools vastly surpass all of the other schools within Stillwater
Commandery. The Thousand Rivers School, the North River School…they
are all much weaker than these three major schools.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All three have an
incredible background.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Skysplitter
Sword Sect is the only one of the three which focuses on swordplay.
It has many disciples, and only by by slaughtering a bloody path
through the others will the elites of the school rise to the peak.
All of them are exceptionally talented, combat-eager figures.”
Baiwei continued, “Enough about this one, though; you already know
about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Please
describe the other two.” Baiwei smiled. “The Hundred Flowers
Fairyland only recruits female disciples. Since they only accept
female disciples, no matter how much of a genius you are, Ji Ning,
you won’t be able to enter. This school is situated in a standalone
dimension which a major power set up single-handedly. That place is
known as the Hundred Flowers Fairyland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Established a
standalone dimension? Ning’s own underwater estate was also in a
dimension of its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no intentions
of joining the Skysplitter Sword Sect, and I can’t enter the
Hundred Flowers Fairyland. Then what of the Black-White College?”
Ning asked. Baiwei chortled. “For now, let’s not discuss the
Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why not?” Ning
asked urgently. “I have my reasons,” Baiwei said. “Let me now
describe the three major tribes of the eight great powers. They are
the Eastriver clan, the Dragonhunter clan, and the Bluewood clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dragonhunter
clan has a divine ability suited for archers that it does not teach
to any outsiders,” Baiwei said. “This Dragonhunter clan often
produces some truly powerful master archers. Master archers,
especially extremely powerful, top-tier ones….they can locate their
enemies from far away with their divine sense, at a distance of a
thousand kilometers or even greater, then release their arrow and
badly injure or even kill their foes from that distance. Even if they
cannot kill their foes, they can immediately retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
He himself was in possession of a divine sense that could stretch to
a distance of over a hundred kilometers. In addition, his divine
ability, the [Starseizing Hand], allowed the power of his hands to
reach a terrifying level. He could use one hand to grip the bow, and
the other to knock the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastriver clan.
They are extremely skilled in commanding water. I’d strongly urge
you not to fight against experts of the Eastriver clan in an aquatic
environment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Bluewood clan is
the oldest of these three major clans, comparable to our Northmont
clan in age. This is a tribe that was established as far back as the
Fiendgod era,” Baiwei said. “The Bluewood clan is extremely
skilled in controlling golems and constructs, and many of the
constructs within Stillwater Commandery were provided by them. Over
the course of countless years…who knows how many powerful
constructs the Bluewood clan has amassed? They, too, are a power
which no one wishes to antagonize.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Three
major schools, three major tribes. All of them were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two major sects
are the Heavenly Saint Church and the Blood God Church.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly Saint
Church acts in a manner which is big-hearted and honest, but also
dominating and overbearing,” Baiwei said. “They have existed for
an extremely long time, and they are also exceptionally mysterious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Blood God Church
was erected sixty million years ago; it is extremely evil and crazed.
The members of the Blood God Church can be described as ‘madmen’;
they will often commit major sins, then suffer pursuit and assault
from the Raindragon Guards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindragon
Guards will pursue after and kill them?” Ning asked, puzzled.
Baiwei smiled. “Ji Ning, you should know that in this world, there
is such a thing as karmic merits, yes?” “Yes,” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course he knew. It
was precisely because of the good karma that he had accumulated that
after being sent to the Netherworld Kingdom, he had been assigned to
be reborn in the Heaven Realm. However, because of that disturbance
in the Netherworld Kingdom, he had entered the mortal realm yet
again. If he hadn’t been able to react quickly, he probably
would’ve had his soul shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acting benevolently
accumulates positive karma; acting vilely results in the creation of
sin,” Baiwei said. “The greater your karmic merits are, the more
you shall be loved by the heavens, and the greater your luck shall
be. But if your sins are too great, your ‘three disasters’ and
‘nine tribulations’ will be very terrifying, and your luck will
be reduced as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing those
creatures who have committed great sins will result in the
accumulation of major karmic merits,” Baiwei said with a smile.
“The Raindragon Guard serves as the army of the Grand Xia Dynasty.
Per the orders of the Grand Xia Dynasty, they will seek out and slay
those who have committed grave sins, resulting in the karmic merits
of the Grand Xia Dynasty as a whole to rise…and thus, the Grand Xia
Dynasty’s fortunes will grow increasingly rosy, and its foundations
will become increasingly firm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was astonished. So
the reason that the Raindragon Guards around the world pursued those
who had committed grave sins…was to improve the fortune of the
Grand Xia Dynasty? He had no idea, but upon being informed, it was
all so simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who have
rendered karmic merits shall have a clean aura swirling about them.
But for those sinners, a corrosive aura will swirl about them,”
Baiwei said. “Supposedly, those with extremely high levels of
karmic merit will emit a golden light, while those who have committed
tremendous sins will radiate a bloody, vile light. Unfortunately,
only someone who has opened the Celestial Eye will be capable of
seeing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. He
himself had opened his Celestial Eye, and had noticed through his
divine sense that a faint, clear aura swirled about him. So this was
‘karmic merit’. However, although he had activated his divine
sense many times afterwards, he had never found any others with this
clear aura around them. Clearly, it was quite difficult to reach this
level of karmic merit, much less the level of emanating golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can one
accumulate sufficient karmic merits?” Ning asked. “Only by doing
good deeds can one gain karmic merits, while carrying out vile deeds
will result in sin. As for the details…I’m not too clear on them
either,” Baiwei said. “Karmic merits and sins; all of these
things are determined by the heavens. They are too complicated.
However, no matter what, Immortal practitioners must not wantonly
slaughter ordinary mortals. It doesn’t matter if an Immortal
practitioner kills another practitioner, but if he kills mortals…then
his sins will definitely accumulate. This is something my father
warned me of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Killing common mortals would result in accumulating major sin? “Thank
you for your guidance, Brother Baiwei,” Ning said gratefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you join a
school, you will quickly learn about the various taboos and
proscriptions,” Baiwei said. “Killing common mortals is
forbidden. Killing one or two is one thing, but the more you kill,
the more trouble it will be. That Bei Zishan you killed? It was
precisely because he murdered far too many common mortals that he was
covered in sin, and thus hunted by the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this topic of
conversation, Ning suddenly thought of something. “You’ve already
spoken of the Heavenly Saint Church, the Blood God Church, the
Eastriver clan, the Bluewood clan, the Dragonhunter clan, the
Skysplitter Sword Sect, and the Hundred Flowers Fairyland. These are
seven of the major powers. Then the final one, the Black-White
College; what’s that all about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cared more about
the schools. He didn’t wish to enter the Skysplitter Sword Sect,
and wouldn’t be permitted to join the Hundred Flowers Fairyland.
The Black-White College was the only one remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College is the most powerful of the eight major powers!” Baiwei
looked towards Ning. “Most powerful?” Ning instantly grew
curious. “Yes.” Baiwei’s eyes were shining. “The other seven
powers are on par with each other; they are all very ancient, and
their roots are deep. But the Black-White College is the true cream
of the crop. In fact, the Black-White College has even produced a
Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial
Immortal?” Ning’s heart instantly began to pound. Good heavens.
Although quite a few of the powers located in the Stillwater
Commandery had Immortals, those were all Loose Immortals or Earth
Immortals. He had never heard of any power being in possession of a
Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Celestial
Immortal.” Baiwei continued, “The Black-White College, at its
peak of power, was once comparable to my Northmont clan of
Stillwater, as well as the Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Countless years have
passed. Although that ancient Celestial Immortal departed long ago,
the Black-White College remains the strongest of the eight powers.”
Baiwei laughed as he looked at Ning. “And, do you know? Of the
three supreme schools, the Skysplitter Sword Sect has a headquarters
that stretches a hundred thousand kilometers, the Hundred Flowers
Fairyland has its own separate dimension, but the Black-White
College…it is located right here in Stillwater City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stillwater City?”
Ning couldn’t believe it. “Stillwater City is so small. How could
a school be located here, and such a supreme school at that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei laughed. “That’s
because this Black-White College’s members range from Immortals to
Zifu Disciples, and they only number in the hundreds. The entire
Black-White College has, in total, a hundred Zifu Disciples, two
hundred Wanxiang Adepts, thirty-plus Primal Daoists, and a number of
Immortals who disappear and reappear randomly. Supposedly, they have
at least six Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. What? A
hundred Zifu Disciples? Two hundred Wanxiang Adepts? There were even
fewer Zifu Disciples than Wanxiang Adepts? They had a ridiculous
number of Primal Daoists as well…and they had at least six
Immortals! That was even more than the Skysplitter Sword Sect had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now do you
understand?” Baiwei looked at Ning. “The Black-White Palace has
exceedingly few members. To enter it is also exceedingly difficult.
Even though I think highly of you, all I can do is recommend you for
entry into the Skysplitter Sword Sect. However, now that you have
already reached the Dao Domain level, you are qualified to enter the
Black-White Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only someone like me
can enter it?” Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College’s name is known even in the royal capital of the Grand Xia
Dynasty.” Baiwei looked at Ning. “Each year, it will accept at
most three or four disciples. Sometimes, it won’t accept any at
all. They only accept those who are true geniuses with unparalleled
abilities to comprehend things. If one’s foundation is even
slightly lacking, one won’t be able to enter. The vast majority of
those who are able to enter the Black-White College are the most
monstrous geniuses of the various tribes within the Stillwater
Commandery. Even some of the major powers outside Stillwater
Commandery will send their geniuses over in the hopes of joining the
Black-White College.”

Chapter 15 - Capturing Fiendgods
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The royal capital of
the Grand Xia Dynasty?” Ji Ning felt a certain itchiness in his
heart. He couldn’t help but immediately begin to flip through this
enormous compiled intelligence report.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei,
seeing how eager Ning was, laughed then said, “Intrigued? Now do
you know what I saved it for last?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning flipped to
the relevant page regarding the Black-White College. “So
actually…so it’s….” Ning, upon reading the information
regarding the glorious history of the Black-White College, began to
mumble to himself, his eyes shining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black-White Diagram?
The Black-White Bedstone Diagram?” Ning, after reading towards the
end of the report, raised his head and looked towards Baiwei, his
eyes filled with curiosity. “Brother Baiwei, is this Black-White
Bedstone Diagram truly so incredible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it not
be?” Baiwei laughed. “After you join the Black-White College, you
will personally see the Black-White Bedstone Diagram. By then, you’ll
understand how miraculous it is.” Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White Diagram
was the most precious treasure of the entire Black-White College! It
was an enormous sculpture that was carved into the diagram of a
black-and-white bedstone. The black-and-white bedstone appeared
ordinary, but in reality it was covered with complicated runes, with
white and black lines crisscrossing it. It was so intricate and
detailed…that the simple crisscrossings of the black and white
lines created incomparably profoundness which contained many
different types of Dao. It was simply unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It allured many of the
major figures from outside sects, who would come to stare at it and
meditate. But of course, since this was the most sacred treasure of
the Black-White College, the major figures of other powers who
occasionally received a chance to view it would be given a time
limit. Only the disciples of the Black-White College would be given
unlimited amounts of time to meditate on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father once
said,” Baiwei explained, “That the Dao is even profounder than
the profound. If one wishes to comprehend it, it is like seeking a
flower in a fog…while the Black-White Bedstone Diagram seems to
summarize the profundities and mysteries of the countless Daos in a
very detailed, expert manner. Those countless crisscrossing black and
white lines…by viewing them in a different way, you will gain
different insights into different mysteries. Such a marvelous item
must have been born from nature itself, which naturally formed this
diagram.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White Diagram
had been found by an Immortal in one of the minor worlds, who had
brought it back here. By relying on the Black-White Diagram, the
College had grown famous and powerful, and had even changed its name
after it, becoming the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to go for a
stroll,” Ning said, rising to his feet. “Go where?” Baiwei
asked. “The Black-White College,” Ning said. “Haha, you can’t
resist taking a look?” Baiwei laughed. “Only when I see it with
my own eyes will I have a better grasp of whether or not I will
choose to join this Black-White College.” Ning was indeed quite
eager to see this Black-White College; after all, every single
disciple of a school such as this could be described as a
unparalleled genius. Ning was naturally quite eager to see what this
place, a gathering spot for supreme geniuses, was like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, I’ll
accompany you.” Baiwei rose to his feet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Baiwei, the
Whitewater Hound, and that golem maidservant walked together within
the estate, heading towards the outside. “Eh?” Baiwei suddenly
noticed several distant figures from the corner of his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was his father,
Northmont Blacktiger, and that triangle-pupiled old man, along with a
third, tall, skinny man. “Xuan Six?” Baiwei frowned, musing to
himself. “Why has Six returned to the estate? Can something major
have occurred?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the only child of
Blacktiger, Baiwei naturally knew many secrets. He instantly
recognized that tall, skinny man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked. “Nothing. Let’s go to the Black-White College,” Baiwei
laughed. “We’re in no hurry today. Let’s just walk.”
“Alright.” Ning laughed, then followed Baiwei out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger and the old
triangle-pupiled servant just stood there, listening to the report
from that tall, skinny man - Xuan Six. The triangle-pupiled old man
glanced sideways, noting the distant Baiwei and Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After discovering
his whereabouts, we did everything we could to set down an
all-encompassing net. In the end, we finally captured that Primordial
Fiendgod. We captured him alive!” The tall, skinny man spoke with
great respect. “Our side lost a squad, a Primal Daoist, and twelve
Wanxiang Adepts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Well done.”
Blacktiger nodded, his deep, abyssal eyes flashing faintly with
lightning. “And where has this Fiendgod been imprisoned?”
Blacktiger asked. “In the second ‘Kun’ trigram character,”
the tall man replied respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktiger nodded
gently. “You can leave now.” “Yes.” The tall, skinny Xuan Six
immediately, quietly slipped away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby
triangle-pupiled servant hurriedly whispered, “Congratulations and
felicitations, master. You caught a Primordial Fiendgod alive.”
Blacktiger responded in a low voice, “Let’s first see what sort
of Fiendgod it is, how strong it is, and what divine abilities it is
skilled in. These Primordial Fiendgods have been able to struggle at
death’s doorstep and survive to this era; none of them are easy to
deal with. Even the weakest of them…might have others of the same
race in hiding. No matter what, we have to take a look. Come, let’s
leave the city.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
triangle-pupiled old servant replied with respect, and soon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A wave of black
energy appeared. Eight black divine dragons, pulling a carriage
behind them, flew out from the Northmont Blacktiger Estate, flying
directly into the heavens, finally disappearing into the skies above
Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Baiwei, by
contrast, were quite relaxed. The two strolled through the
incomparably wide streets, moving a kilometer with each blink of the
eye. The Whitewater Hound and the maidservant were able to
effortlessly keep up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are. The
Black-White College is up ahead,” Baiwei said, pointing towards the
front. The two quickly came to a halt. Ning lifted his head, staring
straight ahead. Up ahead was an enormous edifice, the main gates
three hundred meters tall and nearly six hundred meters wide. The
main gates had three characters inscribed onto it - ‘Black-White
College’. In addition, in the center of these characters, there was
a complicated black-and-white diagram of a bedstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
Bedstone Diagram?” Ning took a look, and as he did, he could sense
infinite mysteries contained within it…but when he took a closer
inspection, he felt as though they were all blurred, and that he
couldn’t get a clear grasp on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those characters in
front of the Black-White College, along with that bedstone diagram,
were left behind by that Celestial Immortal to the Black-White
College.” Baiwei explained, “It isn’t the true Black-White
Bedstone Diagram; the true Black-White Bedstone Diagram is far larger
than this one, and far more complicated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
is.” Ning nodded. On the second floor of the main gate of the
Black-White College, there was an enormous inky-jade stone sculpture
of a lion, as well as the inky-jade stone sculpture of a divine
dragon. They stood at each side of the bedstone, with many soldiers
in the nearby area as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those soldiers
belong to my Marquisate of Stillwater,” Baiwei said. “They’ve
been sent here to help guard this place. That lion and that divine
dragon? They are the true gate guards for the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Them? Guards?”
Ning was astonished. Even with his vision, he hadn’t been able to
tell that the stone lion and the stone dragon were guardians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are two
constructs which the Black-White College purchased from the Bluewood
clan at enormous cost,” Baiwei explained. “Supposedly, these two
constructs have close to an Immortal’s power, and they have
intelligence no lower than an ordinary person’s. They have already
stood guard here for countless years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
Constructs? That were close to Immortals in power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackcurrent!”
Baiwei suddenly called out in a high voice. “Baiwei!” From within
the Black-White College, a white-robed youth who was leading a group
of followers laughed in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei immediately sent
mentally to the nearby Ning, “This person is named Northmont
Blackcurrent. He, too, is a member of our Northmont clan of
Stillwater. However, he’s from an extremely distant branch of the
family. Although his talent was exceptional, he wasn’t viewed as
being very important. Afterwards, however, he actually was able to
successfully enter the Black-White College. His status within our
Northmont clan instantly rose dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning looked
at the white-clothed youth with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, be careful of
this person. This person is extremely good at putting on false
pretenses. My father once said…this Northmont Blackcurrent is a
viper dressed in a sheepskin. You cannot let yourself grow too close
to this sort of person, but there’s no need to create any grudges
between you either.” This was what Baiwei sent to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. A viper
dressed in a sheepskin?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northmont clan of
Stillwater had managed to last from the Fiendgod era to the modern
era. One could imagine how many members it had. Some of the more
distant branches…probably wouldn’t have statuses that were much
higher than that of the Ji clan’s. Only if they produced a supreme
genius would the Marquisate of Stillwater value them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person had
probably been stifled terribly in the past, and so his personality
became distorted.” This was what Ning guessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei, why have you
come?” Blackcurrent laughed. “I brought my good friend, Ji Ning,
to come take a look,” Baiwei replied. “Brother Ji Ning also
wishes to enter this Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spoke out: “It
is extremely hard to enter the Black-White College. I just want to
give it a try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Blackcurrent
glanced at Ning. He instantly felt a hint of dislike towards him! His
experiences in his youth had caused him to view all of the members of
the primary lineage of the Northmont clan, all those exalted young
masters, with extreme jealousy and dislike! Thus, he now easily began
to view Ning as being on Northmont Baiwei’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Even though you
might fail, you should still make an attempt,” Blackcurrent said
with a laugh. He looked at Ning…but a hint of pity was in his gaze.
“You might be lucky. You might get in. By then, we will be fellow
disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
this Blackcurrent had an arrogant, lofty demeanor about him. Clearly,
as Blackcurrent saw it, he himself was an unparalleled genius. As for
this Ji Ning? Since he had come alongside Baiwei, Ji Ning’s status
was extraordinary, but what of it? What the Black-White College cared
about was a person’s innate talent and comprehension ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwei, I can’t
stay here for too long. I have business. Let’s have a good chat,
sometime in the future.” Blackcurrent clasped his hands, then led
his group away. Every member of this group had an extraordinary
demeanor. Based on what Ning could sense, it seemed as though all of
these followers were Immortal cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on
with those followers?” Ning asked. “Didn’t you say that he is
an ordinary member of a distant branch of your Northmont clan? Why
are there so many Immortal practitioners following him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei shook his head.
“Every single disciple of the Black-White College is an
unparalleled genius. You can’t expect them to all do everything for
themselves, can you? Thus, the Black-White College will permit every
single formal disciple to accept ten retainers. Thus, although the
Black-White College only has a few hundred disciples, it has
thousands of retainers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These thousands of
retainers will act on behalf of the Black-White College, and they can
also go listen to the Primal Daoists, or perhaps even the Immortals,
expound on the Dao. They can also be gifted with Ki Refining
techniques. If there is a particularly talented person amongst them,
they might even be promoted to the rank of full disciple. But of
course, it’s rare for even a single retainer to be promoted to full
disciple, even after a hundred years. The Black-White College’s
requirements for its full disciples are quite strict, after all.
Still, no matter what, to be a retainer in the Black-White College is
better than going to be an ordinary disciple in an ordinary school,”
Baiwei said. “Thus, many Immortal practitioners are willing to go
be retainers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
Formidable. By accepting retainers, these genius disciples
essentially formed their own coteries! This helped make the
Black-White College more stable as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, this fellow
clansman of mine, Blackcurrent, seems to not hold you in particularly
high regard, Brother Ji Ning,” Baiwei said. “When the time comes,
after you enter the Black-White College, the look on his face will be
priceless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “My
mind is settled!” Baiwei was startled. “Are you saying…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the twelth lunar
month, I will enter this Black-White College.” Ning raised his
head, staring towards the words left behind by that Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black-White
College…this was the place where he would begin his sudden rise to
prominence!

Chapter 16 - The Twelfth Lunar Month, Entering a School
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, and in the
blink of an eye, the twelth lunar month arrived. The first to the
third days of the twelfth lunar month were the days which many of the
schools located in Stillwater City would accept disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Meng Xin,
Meng Jun, and Meng Roch walked out of an alley, arriving at the main
street. “There are so many people here,” Meng Xin breathed in
amazement. Meng Jun said, his expression exuberant, “That goes
without saying. Today is the first day of the twelfth lunar month,
the very first day in which one can join a school. There are
countless people in Stillwater City who will join a school today.
There are ordinary mortals, Xiantian lifeforms, and also Zifu
Disciples like us! However, those top-tier schools generally will
only accept early Zifu stage experts! We are all early Zifu stage
experts; it should be much easier for us to join a school.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Xin secretly gave
the neaby Meng Roch a sideways glance. Previously, when the
Snowdragon Mountain experts had ambushed them, Roch had executed a
forbidden technique in order to save her. This had resulted in damage
to his cultivation base, and it would now be much harder for him to
join a school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister Xin,
let’s go,” Jun said. Suddenly, he gave the nearby Roch a sidelong
glance, and then a look of amusement appear on his face. “Rocky,
although your cultivation foundation was damaged, you are still an
early stage Zifu Disciple. If you are lucky, perhaps you’ll
encounter some schools that didn’t investigate too carefully, and
you’ll still be able to join them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch found it hard to
hide the anger from his face. What did Jun mean by ‘didn’t
investigate too carefully’? Accepting new disciples was something
which determined a school’s future. Which school was careless in
doing this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oho, you are angry.”
Jun let out a snicker, then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother Rocky.”
Meng Xin couldn’t help but call out to him, but Roch said in a low
voice, “You two can go. I’ll go by myself to try out some
schools.” Xin hesitated, then said, “Big Brother Rocky, I’ll go
with you. Let’s go join a school together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch couldn’t help
but feel surprised and delighted. But right at this moment, Jun, who
had already walked quite far away, turned and called out to Xin,
“Little Sister Xin!” Xin stood there by Roch’s side. “I’ll
stay with Big Brother Rocky,” she said. This caused a hint of
excitement to appear on Roch’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jun stared. “You’ll
go with him? How can he possibly enter any decent school?” Xin
replied, “When Big Brother Rocky used that forbidden technique, he
saved your life as well. And you actually treat him like this? I
won’t go with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because she was both
beautiful and talented since she was a child, Xin had always been
doted on. Thus, she had a bit of a spoiled streak. Although she
slightly looked down on both Roch and Jun, she still felt very
grateful towards Roch for having rescued her life on the journey
over. As for Jun…Xin naturally now held Meng Jun in great contempt,
due to the way he treated his savior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Jun
stared. “Hmph.” Xin just snorted coldly. Jun turned and left. As
he did, he said, “You just wait and see. I want to see what sort of
a school you two will end up joining.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Xin turned to look
towards Meng Roch. “Big Brother Rocky, let’s go.” As for Roch,
a blazing fire was in his heart, and so he followed Xin forward. The
two would try to join a school on their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Stillwater.
Northmont Blacktiger’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwei, no
need to send me off,” Ji Ning laughed. Northmont Baiwei laughed as
well. “Then I’ll wait for your good news, Ji Ning.” Ning
clasped his hands, then turned and left, taking his Whitewater Hound
with him as he headed directly towards the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The recent days he had
spent in Northmont Blacktiger’s Estate had all been quite calm and
peaceful. Ning had learned through Baiwei that in recent days, thanks
to the power he had displayed in the Carefree Caverns, there had
indeed been quite a few schools which had sent people to the Estate
with the goal of having Ning join them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them had made
extremely good offers. Some offered an Immortal as his master; others
offered five hundred kilograms of liquefied elemental essence; still
others had prepared a Heaven-ranked magic treasure for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many offers had been
made, and these offers were good enough to make even a Primal Daoist
envious. In terms of value, there weren’t at all inferior to the
entire value of the elemental ore mine that had been discovered in
the Ji clan’s territory. Unfortunately, the Skysplitter Sword Sect
wasn’t amongst them, nor the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the three major
schools that were amongst the eight great powers of Stillwater
Commandery, the Hundred Flowers Fairyland only accepted female
disciples, while the Skysplitter Sword Sect was extremely proud and
wouldn’t go recruit disciples. As for the Black-White College, of
course it would never, ever proactively reach out to potential
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those schools are
all much weaker than the three major schools. The Ki Refining
techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts they have to offer are
all on a lower level as well.” Ning shook his head. This lower
level represented a difference that was as great as that between the
heavens and the earth. The more top-tier a Ki Refining technique was,
the better a chance one would have of becoming an Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later. “Here
we are.” Ning raised his head, staring towards the distant
Black-White College. The Whitewater Hound looked at it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really are
quite a lot of people here today,” Ning sighed. The Whitewater
Hound sent mentally towards him, “This Black-White College is
extremely exacting in its standards for taking on new disciples.
Ning, son, don’t be careless and end up eliminated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, Uncle
White.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Today, the gates to the
Black-White College were wide open. People were allowed to freely
enter, and Ning entered, the Whitewater Hound by his side. Within the
thronging masses of people present were the various Immortal
cultivators who wished to enter the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, I will
definitely work hard. I’ll enter the Black-White College at one
try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College. I’ll definitely enter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will definitely
become a disciple of the Black-White College. Sister Ru promised that
she would be my wife if I succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Immortal
cultivators were gritting their teeth. Near them, many spirit-beasts,
servants, family members, and friends were present as well. “There
has to be thousands of people here,” Ning said to himself,
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From up ahead, an angry
voice rang out. “Why have you, a middle stage Ki Refiner, come to
my Black-White College? Hurry up and leave. Everyone who wishes to
enter our Black-White College, listen up; you must be an early stage
Ki Refiner. Our Black-White College will only accept early stage Ki
Refiners! If you aren’t an early stage Ki Refiner, hurry up and
leave, unless you want to listen to me curse at you. NEXT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm. The toughness
of your meridian channels is insufficient. Begone. NEXT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve used a
forbidden technique, and you still have come to my Black-White
College? Scram! NEXT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your meridian
channels are insufficiently wide. Begone. NEXT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm. You barely
qualify. Go inside and wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning heard every single
evaluation with perfect clarity. Hearing the voice ring out from far
away, he couldn’t help but feel surprised. The vast majority had
been eliminated, just based on their physical qualifications. From
this, one could tell how strict the standards were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later.
Ning moved closer to the front, and he saw the scene happening up
ahead. There was a lake in the distance, and above the lake there was
a boat with a black-haired middle-aged man seated on it. The man sat
there, holding a flagon of wine, appearing quite relaxed. An enormous
bronze mirror hung there in the air above him, and it shone down
towards the Immortal practitioners that flew towards the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
A young man flew forward, standing atop the water without sinking
down. Rumble…the light of the bronze mirror shone down upon him.
“Mm. You just barely qualify. Go inside and wait,” the
black-haired, middle-aged man said casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior.”
The young man instantly walked forward atop the water, moving at high
speed across the lake and arriving at the opposite end of it. There
were tens of young men and women waiting there already, as well as a
few youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Immortal cultivator
after another was eliminated, and they all had to return to the side
of the shore from whence they had come. As for those who passed, they
all flew to the other shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another graceful
young master glided towards the top of the lake. Cupping his hands,
he said, “Meng Tang greets you yet again, senior.” The giant
bronze mirror shone down on him from above, and the black-haired,
middle-aged man revealed a rare hint of a satisfied smile. “Go in.”
Meng Tang bowed modestly, then flew to the other shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White. Wait
here for me.” Ning looked at the Whitewater Hound by his side, then
sent him a mental message. The Whitewater Hound nodded. Swoosh!
Ning’s figure flickered, and he too appeared atop the lake.
Clasping his hands, he said, “My respects to you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dressed in
animal furs?” “This young man is dressed in animal furs? How
rare.” “I wonder where he came from.” “He looks quite young…I
imagine he must be quite talented.” The spectators were all
chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
quite calm. Although some of those people looked down on his animal
fur clothes, these clothes were a perfect copy of the fur clothes his
mother had personally sown for him. When he wore these furs, he felt
incomparably comfortable, as though his mother was right there by his
side. As for the actual fur clothes his mother had sown, he couldn’t
bear to wear them, for fear of wearing them out. He kept them safely
hidden away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired,
middle-aged man on the boat gave Ning a glance. “Move faster. No
need to put on airs.” The bronze mirror in the sky shone down
towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning
suddenly had a strange feeling, as though this light had penetrated
through his skin, flesh, and bones throughout his body. “Eh? A
Fiendgod Body Refiner?” The black-haired, middle-aged man gave Ning
a surprised glance, then nodded in satisfaction. “Your talent isn’t
bad. And you’ve already reached the Zifu level as a Fiendgod as
well, and seemingly in a very perfect manner. What technique do you
train in?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!” Ning gave a direct response, and his
words instantly elicited surprised cries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary number
one Fiendgod Body Refining technique? Someone was actually able to
train to the Zifu level in it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He appears to be
simply a youth…it really is true that the younger an Immortal
cultivator appears, the more one must be wary of them. For him to be
able to successfully train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] at such a young age…formidable, formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really are
quite a few geniuses that have come to join the Black-White College.
I came very early in the morning, and this is now the second person I
have seen here who trains in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] and is at the Zifu level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ears twitched.
Oh? He wasn’t the only one here who had successfully trained in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
black-haired, middle-aged man nodded with a smile. “Go. Still, you
must not be the slightest bit careless. Perhaps you might be able to
enter my College after all.” Ning bowed, his heart filled with
surprise. “Thank you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though the
Black-White College’s requirements for accepting new disciples
truly were exacting. Even someone at the seventh stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]… only ‘might’ have
a chance at entering? Still, the Black-White College attracted the
interest of all of the supreme talents of Stillwater Commandery, and
even some of the supreme geniuses outside of Stillwater Commandery
would come here. Each year, they would at most select three or four
disciples, or perhaps none at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just by relying on the
fact that Ning was at the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens], he could probably easily enter the Skysplitter
Sword Sect. But it was incredibly difficult to become one of the very
few disciples of the Black-White College!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning moved
forward, and it was as though he was one with the water under his
feet. Quite easily and simply, he flashed across the surface of the
water, arriving on the opposite shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifth Bro, yet
another practitioner of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] has come.” A youth was currently speaking to a
black-clothed youth next to him. The black-clothed youth gave Ning a
glance, and Ning glanced back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] have you reached?” The
black-clothed youth asked. But Ning just turned his head, not even
glancing at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed youth
frowned. Within his clan, he was viewed as a peerless, heaven-favored
genius. He was used to being pampered. Moreover, he had reached the
seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and
was now at the Blood-Drop Rebirth level of power. He, too, had
decided to join the Black-White College. He was accustomed to not
holding others of the same generation with any regard, and by relying
on his divine ability, he was even able to fight those at a higher
level. Naturally, he was an extremely proud man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. He doesn’t
know his place.” The black-clothed youth gave Ning a glance, then
paid him no more attention. As for Ning, he chose a large rock, then
sat down atop it in the lotus position. He couldn’t be bothered to
notice that black-clothed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time passed on, the
number of young men and women nearby grew more and more numerous.
Some were from major tribes, and there were even those from outside
Stillwater Commandery. Even members of the Northmont clan of
Stillwater had come. Ning occasionally would glance at them, but he
wouldn’t engage any of them in conversation. He knew that of the
people in front of him, most likely at most one or two would actually
be able to enter the Black-White College.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, and in the
blink of an eye, it was sunset. By now, only the silhouette of half
the sun could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, things will
end here. Those who wish to join my Black-White College, please come
early tomorrow morning.” The black-haired middle-aged man on the
boat within the lake waved his hand as he spoke, and the bronze
mirror in the air above him rapidly began to shrink to the size of a
palm as it landed towards his hand. After that, the ship
automatically began to move towards the other side of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man stored away the
ship, then disembarked. He looked at the thronging masses of youths,
then nodded slightly. “Those who are confident in themselves will
generally come on the first day to apply for entry. The majority of
those who were accepted by my Black-White College all came on the
first day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of 962 of
you have passed the preliminary selection process on the first day,
but the number of which you who will truly be able to join my
Black-White College can be counted on one hand. Thus, all of you must
be incomparably cautious. You must put forth your full effort.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The nine
hundred plus selectees all responded in unison. The black-haired man
nodded. “Mm. Follow me.” Turning, he walked away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, this group
of young Immortal practitioners all moved to follow him. Ning turned
to glance backwards, and he saw that on the other side of the lake,
there were quite a few people still waiting quietly. These should
most likely be the family, friends, and servants of the selectees.
There was also a large Whitewater Hound who stood there, quietly
staring towards this side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White
College, located within Stillwater City, took up an area with a
circumference of roughly nine hundred kilometers. Amongst the various
Immortal practitioner schools, this was definitely one of the smaller
ones. Still, nine hundred kilometers…in his past life on Earth, one
of the trillion minor worlds, it would be comparable to a local
county. As for Stillwater City, the very heart of Stillwater
Commandery and a place where countless powerful experts gathered, it
was larger than entire countries back on Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that it was
roughly comparable to a county in size, strictly speaking, the
Black-White College couldn’t be described as ‘small’ per se.
And within the Black-White College, there was even a small mountain
range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
his group, under the guidance of the black-haired man, quickly
advanced more than a hundred kilometers, arriving within a gorge.
“Halt,” the black-haired man said. The nine hundred plus
individuals all came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise,” the
black-haired man suddenly barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wide, spacious
gorge had a perimeter of many kilometers. Suddenly, from far away, a
curtain of clear water could be seen, which had formed into an
enormous grand sealing formation. This grand sealing formation was
extraordinary large; not only did it cover the entire gorge, it even
covered several of the nearby mountain peaks. Naturally, the nine
hundred plus selectees were trapped within it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
“Rumble…” “Rumble…” Multiple mechanical noises rang out.
From within one of the caverns within the region covered by the grand
sealing formation, multiple giant shadows suddenly flew out. 810 of
these shadows flew out consecutively, halting in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were 810 dragon
heads, all of which had their mouths open wide as they stared down
below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grand construct
formation.” “A grand formation formed from more than 810
constructs!” Some of the nine hundred plus Immortal cultivators
below instantly began to call out, quite a few of their faces ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The
black-haired middle-aged man charged into the skies, flying to the
top of those 810 dragon heads. At the same time, five additional
figures flew out from the cave next to him, each with powerful auras.
There were a total of six figures, including the black-haired man;
five men, one woman. All of them stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up,” the
black-haired man barked. “Afterwards, the grand golem formation
will launch attacks…what all of you need to do is endure the
attacks and charge into the skies, and to arrive at this cavern by my
side. You have as much time as it takes for a stick of incense to
finish burning. If you do so, that means you’ve succeeded. But if
no one manages to reach this cave before the stick of incense is
burnt up, that means none of you are qualified to join my Black-White
College!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the nine
hundred plus youths below were confident, while others were nervous.
Still others just waited quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hiss.” A stick of
incense appeared out of nowhere within the black-haired man’s
hands, and then it was immediately set alight. At the same time,
those 810 dragon head’s simultaneously began to glow with a
dazzling azure light, and then, from the mouth of every single dragon
head shot out rays of azure lightning. The sound was thunderous!
Boom! Boom! Boom! One bolt of lightning after another rained down
upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though ten
thousand bolts of lightning were descending at the same time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It begins now!”
The black-haired man barked at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the dragon
heads had begun to vomit lightning, and that the stick of incense had
already been lit, everyone knew that it had begun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charging into that
cave won’t be easy.” Ning raised his head, giving it a glance. In
his heart, he instantly realized that because the 810 dragon heads
were next to the side of the cave, if one wished to enter it, one
would have to fly directly past those 810 dragon heads…which were
constantly raining thunderbolts downwards towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Down below, given how
much space there was, each person wouldn’t have to face too many
thunderbolts. But the closer one flew towards the cave, the more
tightly packed the thunderbolts would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Ning,
wielding his Darknorth swords, chopped directly towards one of the
encroaching thunderbolts. The Darknorth swords were filled with
elemental ki, and were capable of blocking lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So powerful.” Ning
felt his hands tremble violently. “The power of this lightning is
significant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Up!” “Let’s
go!” “Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, multiple
figures mounted their magic treasures and, in unison, charged towards
the sky. But the farther up they went, the more thunderbolts awaited
them. They were only able to hold on for a few breaths, making it
halfway up, then were knocked downwards by the dense rain of
thunderbolts, forced to land again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Primal Daoists
of the Black-White College who were above the dragon heads watched
on, chatting and laughing amongst themselves. “Everyone, of these
youths, how many do you think will enter the caves?” A middle-aged
man with a long beard laughed as he asked this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short, chubby, bald
man chortled. “Perhaps not even a single one.” “It shouldn’t
be that bad,” a white-robed woman said with a laugh. “There
should at least be three or four who can enter the cave. Look,
there’s someone charging upwards. She shouldn’t be too weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the other
Primal Daoists turned to look carefully. A black-clothed woman was
charging into the skies, her body surrounded by multiple tendrils.
When the lightning bolts struck against her, the tendrils and vines
would actively go block the lightning, defending against one bolt
after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, she made it to
the halfway point, and moved closer and closer towards the formation
of dragon heads. “Half of the grand golem formation.” The
black-haired, middle-aged man suddenly spoke softly, and instantly,
of the 810 dragon heads, 405 of them focused on that black-clothed
woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, thousands of
bolts of lightning wildly, completely focused on that black-clothed
woman. Although those tendrils and vines struggled ferociously, they
weren’t able to do anything. BOOM! Vines and tendrils exploded, and
the black-clothed woman fell down from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She couldn’t even
withstand half.” The black-clothed, middle-aged man shook his head.
The white-robed woman shook her head as well. “She can’t be
considered a true genius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no rush to
charge forward. He watched for a period of time first. He watched as
that black-clothed youth who also trained in the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] charged upwards. As that youth moved
extremely close to the formation of dragon heads, he suddenly
suffered the attack of every single dragon head. As the youth slammed
to the ground, Ning understood everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the very bottom,
you only have to meet an occasional bolt of lightning. The higher up
you to, the more bolts will strike you. If you pass the halfway
point, you will suffer an attack from half of the dragon heads. And,
when you are extremely close, you will suffer mass attacks from all
the dragon heads.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be able
to withstand the full might of all of the dragon heads in order to
enter the cavern. At such short range…even if two or three people
joined forces, upon suffering the full bront of the attacks of the
dragon heads, whether or not they work together becomes of little
importance.” Ning understood this principle. When they were
extremely close to the dragon heads, the amount of space for
maneuvering was too small. The myriad thunderbolts would form a
nearly complete, solid attack. A web of lightning would completely
surround that entire region, and to pass, one would have to charge
through. There were no shortcuts around it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!” After
making sure that there were no other oddities, Ning’s body
instantly became surrounded by six full layers of Waterflame Lotuses.
At the same time, a flying sword appeared beneath his feet, and he
immediately controlled the sword to soar into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
“Charge!” At virtually the same instant Ning flew upwards, eight
other figures charged upwards as well. These had all been watching
silently. After seeing how the black-clothed man had, in the end,
suffered attacks from all the dragon heads…they all realized that
there were no shortcuts to be taken, and so had decided to charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!” The
black-clothed man, who had fallen down halfway, gritted his teeth
upon seeing the others charge upwards. He, too, flew upwards yet
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 810 dragon heads
were clustered in one location, quite close to the cave. To enter
this cave, one would have to pass through the center of them…which
ensured that one would have to face all 810 attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Six Primal Daoists
stared downwards, watching. “This fellows are all quite spirited.
None of them are holding back now.” The black-haired, middle-aged
man laughed. “Everyone, who do you think will pass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That fellow
controlling the Azure Dragon construct.” The white-clothed woman’s
eyes lit up as she stared at a white-clothed youth who stood atop an
Azure Dragon. This white-robed youth was clearly quite young; there
was still a hint of youthful shyness on his face, but the Azure
Dragon construct under his control was incomparably nimble,
occasionally dodging while knocking aside the bolts of lightning at
other times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within this grand
sealing formation of ours, one can only use a golem or construct
which one personally made.” The white-clothed woman continued,
“Look at how he controls that construct. He’s at the level where
it is like controlling part of his body; he is the construct, and the
construct is him. He is absolutely a genius of the Dao of
Constructs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” “Right.”
“Formidable.” The others all nodded and assented. These Primal
Daoists were no ordinary Primal Daoists; they were the Primal Daoists
of Black-White College. All of them were naturally extraordinary
figures, and their judgment was impeccable. They could instantly tell
that this white-clothed youth had astonishing talent in the Dao of
Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think of
the others?” The black-haired, middle-aged man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The others?” “I
don’t see anyone particularly outstanding.” “They are average.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Primal Daoists
all had extremely high standards; although all of the others, Ning
included, had displayed formidable abilities, there was nothing which
could make these Primal Daoists feel surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” The
black-haired, middle-aged man instantly began to laugh loudly. “All
of you bury yourselves in training. We’ve asked you to come this
time to organize the acceptance of new disciples, but you aren’t
aware of many things. As for this old Daoist…I collect news from
everywhere, and know that there is a true genius in this group. Look
over there; that fur-clad youth whose body is surrounded by those
blooming lotuses of fire and water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” The other
five Primal Daoists looked over. The white-clothed woman said,
“Although his lotuses of fire and water is quite marvelous, it
can’t be described as astonishing. What about him?” And indeed,
the other Primal Daoists didn’t understand either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired man
laughed. “He is dressed in furs, can create lotus flowers of fire
and water, and uses a sword…nine out of ten says that he is that
youth, Ji Ning, of the Carefree Caverns. A young, early stage Zifu
Disciple who has already gained insight into a Dao Domain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gained insight into
a Dao Domain?” The other five Primal Daoists were all shocked, and
they all lowered their heads, looking towards Ning, who had seemed so
ordinary and unremarkable.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten thousand
thunderbolts shot down simultaneously, crashing down towards the
figures below. Those Immortal cultivators, in turn, all flew for the
skies, each displaying their own abilities. Layers of golden light
appeared around some of their bodies, while others had illusory
divine dragons appear about them. In this situation, the Waterflame
Lotuses swirling around Ning’s body truly wasn’t that special.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-clothed youth
was currently standing atop an Azure Dragon construct. The Azure
Dragon coiled about, its body occasionally lashing out while its
sharp claws swept out in each direction. Even its draconic tail
whipped about. For now, not a single bolt of lightning was capable of
drawing close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Dragon Swings
Its Tail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Dragon Flies
Skyward.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-clothed youth
was gently mumbling a few words every so often, his eyes blazing with
heat. Clearly, he was completely lost in controlling his Azure Dragon
construct, and he appeared to be incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half the construct
formation, focus.” The black-haired, middle-aged man hovering high
in the air gave the order. Instantly, more than four hundred of the
dragon head constructs began to focus their lightning bolts down
towards Ning and the others who were charging skywards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Awesome, wonderful,
incredible!” The white-clothed youth grew increasingly excited. The
Azure Dragon construct he controlled was displaying all of its unique
points and releasing tremendous amounts of combat power. It was able
to effortless block all of the oncoming bolts of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” With but a
twist of its tail, multiple lightning bolts were knocked aside by the
dragon, but Ning was right by its side. The Waterflame Lotuses
swirled around Ning, who had the Darknorth swords in his two hands.
Those lightning bolts, despite being able to pass through the
protective Waterflame Lotuses, were easily blocked by Ning’s two
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword light
flashed forward like water, moving with ease and grace as he blocked
all of the bolts of lightning. “Eh?” Ning’s face changed. Three
bolts of lightning had suddenly attacked him, and they were too
close. They instantly arrived, catching Ning, who had been
unprepared, completely off-guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watertight.”
Ning’s swords instantly changed directions, hurriedly moving to
block those lightning bolts. At the same time, Ning couldn’t help
but give that white-clothed youth close to him a glance. Just now, he
had been affected by the actions of that youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-clothed youth
was currently looking towards Ning as well, and a look of
embarrassment was on his face. He hurriedly sent, “I’m ashamed,
I’m ashamed. It was accidental.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing how the
white-clothed youth was sending a mental message, even at a critical
time like this, Ning actually felt kindly disposed to him. He sent
back, “No worries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll be more
careful in the future,” the white-robed youth sent back. “Just be
careful. We’re about to face the combined attacks of all those
constructs,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were both able
to converse mentally at a time like this; clearly, they still had
energy to spare. They continued to fly higher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outlines of the
dragon heads up above them grew increasingly clear. The 810 dragon
heads were clustered together quite tightly, and of the group that
had charged up alongside them, two had already been struck down. Only
eight figures were able to continue to fly upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire construct
formation, focus!” The black-haired, middle-aged man gave the order
once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, it was as
though the skies had shattered and the earth had collapsed. All of
the dragon heads focused their attacks on a single area, and for a
moment, it seemed as though the entire world was filled with
lightning bolts. Every inch of the surrounding area seemed to be
filled with azure bolts of lightning; clearly, they had completely
satured the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotuses!”
Ning’s eyes flashed with a fierce look, and one layer after another
of Waterflame Lotuses began to manifest around him. Whenever one
layer was damaged, a new one would be born. As for the two swords in
Ning’s hands, they flashed about, filling the area around Ning with
sword light. Not a single bolt of lightning was capable of
penetrating Ning’s swordplay defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, Ning
managed to pass through this saturated field of attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! As he charged
through the heavens and past the formation of dragon heads, Ning was
now able to clearly see, with a single glance, the six Primal Daoists
who were watching this event.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” An
incomparably dominating Azure Dragon charged into the heavens, also
moving past the dragon head formation. The white-clothed youth atop
the Azure Dragon, seeing that Ning had charged out as well, revealed
a hint of a friendly smile towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Ning
immediately flew towards the cave, and the white-clothed youth also
flew over, then stored away his construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Clash!”
“Boom!” Continuous sounds of explosions could be heard, with
furious roars mixed in. Three more figures charged past the saturated
field of lightning and into the cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cave was many tens
of meters wide. The white-robed youth walked forward alongside Ning.
“My name is Mu Northson. I truly am embarrassed for what happened
earlier. My mastery over my craft was insufficient, and I ended up
harming you, fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Ji Ning.”
Ning smiled towards him as well. “You can’t be blamed. You were
trying to enter the school, just like me. How could you be careless?”
The white-clothed youth hurriedly nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could clearly
sense that this white-clothed youth seemed slightly immature. By the
looks of him, he was even younger than Ning himself. Most likely, he
had reached the Xiantian level even before Ning had. He immediately
asked, “Brother Mu, I’m sixteen years of age this year. How old
are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fourteen.” The
white-clothed youth, Mu Northson, gave an honest response. Instantly,
the other three youths who had charged into the cave had changed
looks on their faces. The three of them looked towards Ning and
Northson with incomparably complicated looks on their faces.
Monster…monsters! One was sixteen, while the other was fourteen!
How young were they? And yet, these two had actually broken through
the lightning construct formation before everyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
even had some injuries on his body. He gave Ning a hard look. “This
person named Ji Ning is only sixteen, but he’s already at the Zifu
level in terms of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. In
addition, he was actually able to charge in with ease. I had to make
two attempts before succeeding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, he had been
the first to try to charge in, but had ended up failing on his first
attempt. It was only after seeing him fail did Ji Ning and the others
make their charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had immediately
charged in behind Ning, and then followed the Azure Dragon construct
of the white-robed youth, Northson, in charging past. With the Azure
Dragon construct blocking some of the lightning, things had been
slightly easier for him. Still, it had only been slightly easier; he
still suffered an injury in order to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It truly was hard.”
The white-clothed youth, Northson, glanced downwards, then sighed,
“This grand lightning construct formation truly was hard to pass
through. The Black-White College really lives up to its reputation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked downwards
as well. Below them, the other Immortal cultivators were still
continuing to charge upwards, time and time again. “It is hard,”
Ning agreed softly. “However, the vast region controlled by the
Stillwater Commandery holds many geniuses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another figure
passed through the blocking field of lightning. Slashing forward in a
lonely arc, it landed at the entrance to the cave. This was a
violet-robed maiden whose face was like the frost and the snow.
Judging from the look in her eyes…clearly, she had been arrogant
since she was a child. Still, every single person who was able to
enter the cave was a true talent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few moments later.
“The time has come to an end.” The black-haired, middle-aged man
spoke out in a high voice, and instantly, the 810 dragon heads came
to a halt. Those Immortal cultivators who were in midair still wanted
to fly upwards, but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, go
down!” The black-haired man gave a sudden roar, and his eyes
instantly became terrifying to behold. A terrifyingly powerful divine
sense swept downwards, and instantly, all of the Immortal cultivators
who had wanted to fly upwards came to a halt. And then, all of them
began to drop downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine sense?”
Ning’s eyes lit up as he saw this. “A divine sense attack!”
When those Immortal cultivators had been hit by the attack, their
gazes had turned dim, and then they had fallen out from the skies.
Clearly, their souls had been impacted by the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there are
attacking techniques for the divine sense as well?” Ning instantly
felt an itchiness in his heart. His greatest strength was his divine
soul, which was already comparable to a Primal Daoist’s. In
addition, by relying on the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique,
his divine soul was continuing to grow stronger by the day. At this
point, however, he had only been able to use his divine will to
control items to assist himself. He had never heard that there were
techniques which could allow one to use one’s divine sense to
directly attack someone’s soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A divine sense
attack? How would that even work? I’ve never heard of it…it must
be an extremely high-level technique. Since that black-haired man is
able to use it, then I imagine the Black-White College must have this
divine sense technique amongst this records.” Ning instantly made
up his mind that no matter what, he had to acquire and learn this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired man
and the rest of the six figures flew into the cave. They all appeared
different; one looked graceful, another was short and chubby, a third
was cold-faced…but they all possessed shockingly powerful auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the nine called out respectfully, “Respectful greetings, seniors.”
The six Primal Daoists swept Ning and the rest of the nine with their
gazes. “Mm.” Quite a few gazes paused for a period of time after
landing on Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” The
black-haired, middle-aged man pointed to a blue-clothed youth who
wore a crown and whose gaze was flashing. The blue-clothed youth’s
face changed, and he hurriedly said, “Senior, this junior is
Eastriver Lush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
gave him a glance. Eastriver clan? That was one of the eight major
powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastriver clan?”
The black-haired, middle-aged man laughed coldly. “I don’t care
where you came from. Everyone, even a member of the Northmont clan of
Stillwater or the imperial clan of the Grand Xia Dynasty, must obey
the rules of the Black-White College if they wish to join our
Black-White College. You used a Dao-seal. You violated the rules.
Hurry up and begone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crowned youth
gritted his teeth, then immediately transformed into a ray of light
as he flew towards the cave entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used a Dao-seal?”
Ning stared in astonishment at this disciple of the Eastriver clan.
When testing new disciples, there had been, at the gate, a list of
the various necessary requirements. Dao-seals and other external
sources of support were forbidden. One had to rely on one’s own
power to pass the trials. All who used external sources of power
would be expelled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are Mu
Northson?” The black-haired man turned to look towards the
white-robed youth, a smile on his face. “Greetings, senior,”
Northson said respectfully. The black-haired, middle-aged man nodded.
“Fourteen years. Not bad. Let me take a look at your construct.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
knew the rules; there were restrictions on utilizing constructs. If
one was an Immortal practitioner who walked on the Dao of Constructs
and golems…if they wished to bring a construct into a trial, it was
forbidden for the construct to possess sentience! Nor could there be
an elemental energy core within the construct. It had to be
completely controlled by their own elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, during the
earlier trial, the six Primal Daoists could already tell the truth of
the matter. This ‘examination’ was just for the sake of following
the rules to the letter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The inspection
concluded. “Mm.” The black-haired, middle-aged man nodded.
“Acceptable.” Northson immediately accepted the Azure Dragon
construct back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you.”
The black-haired, middle-aged man swept Ning and the other seven with
his gaze. “You’ve passed through the first test. Next is the
second and final test. As long as you can pass it, you will become a
disciple of our Black-White College. If, however, you are unable to
pass, I’ll have to ask you to all leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second and final
test?” Ning was surprised. Even that black-haired youth who had
reached the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] had just barely passed the first test. And yet, there was a
second, follow-up test?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chong, child.” One
of the six Primal Daoists, that white-robed woman, spoke out. The
black-clothed youth said respectfully, “Aunt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you reach the
ninth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], you
will definitely be able to enter our Black-White College. But you are
only at the seventh…” The white-robed woman shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t wait any
longer. I’ll need at least ten to twenty years to reach the ninth
stage,” the black-clothed youth replied impatiently. The
white-robed woman shook her head. “You won’t be able to pass the
final test.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunt. I wish to
try.” The black-clothed youth gritted his teeth. How could he
casually give up at a time like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His response caused the
white-robed woman to shake her head.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_19___The_Final_Guardian"></A>
Chapter 19 - The Final Guardian
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As one of the managers
of this recruitment effort, Fairy Hua Yun naturally knew how
difficult the final test would be. This junior of her clan, Hua
Chong, had no chance of success at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you,
follow me,” the black-haired, middle-aged man said. The six Primal
Daoists began to walk in front, while Ji Ning and the rest of the
eight followed from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at the nearby black-clothed youth. The youth’s eyes were filled
with defiance and madness. His aunt was Fairy Hua Yun…her status in
the Hua clan was extremely high, and although the Hua clan had an
Immortal guarding it, since Fairy Hua Yun was a Primal Daoist of the
Black-White College, her combat prowess was definitely comparable to
an Immortal’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to honor and
respect the words of Fairy Hua Yun. But…he also had to enter the
Black-White College. He, too, wished to be like his aunt and be a
member of the Black-White College! “I have to enter. The Dao of the
Heavens ensures that one will always have a chance.” The
black-clothed youth gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking through
the dark, gloomy caves for a period of time, they arrived at an exit.
Up ahead, there were nine different entrances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt,” the
black-haired man said. Ning and the other seven all came to a halt.
“These nine entrances are each guarded by a Zifu Disciple of our
Black-White College.” The black-haired, middle-aged man swept Ning
and the others with his gaze. “The eight of you shall each choose a
passageway.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Ning and
the rest of the eight all changed. What?! Guarded by full disciples
of the Black-White College? These were people who trained in supreme
techniques and arts, while the eight of them were all only early Zifu
Ki Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you each enter
your chosen corridors, you will encounter these guardian disciples.
As long as you are able to charge through out of cave while they are
guarding it, you will become a disciple of our Black-White College.”
A smile was on the face of the man. “Don’t worry. These Zifu
Disciples on guard are only permitted to use a single type of
technique, while all of you can go all out. In addition, there is no
need for you to defeat the guardian disciple; you only need to charge
out of the cave. Afterwards, we shall all reunite at the peak of this
mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
the rest of the eight all nodded. “Go, then,” the black-haired,
middle-aged man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They quickly each
selected a corridor. Ning pondered slightly, then chose one for
himself as well. Only the black-haired youth hesitated for a period
of time…and then, gritting his teeth, he entered a corridor as
well. All of them entered their corridors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu Xiu.” The
short, pudgy, bald man laughed. “You are in charge of this disciple
recruitment, and are managing it from start to finish. Tell me, of
the eight, which will be able to become disciples of our Black-White
College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired,
middle-aged man hesitated. “If I have to choose…of the eight, I’d
say Ji Ning will definitely succeed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, he’ll
definitely succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone knows that
Ji Ning will succeed, old Daoist Wu Xiu. What about the other seven?”
All of the others were laughing while speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired,
middle-aged man pondered for a bit longer, then said, “Of these
eight, only Ji Ning will definitely succeed. It will be hard for all
of the other seven. If you insist on me choosing someone…that
fourteen year old kid who controls the Azure Dragon construct, Mu
Northson. There’s a chance for him as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Aside from Ji
Ning, the others will all find it quite difficult, especially that
clansman of Fairy Hua Yun. He found it rather difficult to even make
it through the lightning construct array; he definitely won’t make
it past this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone knows how
smart you are.” The white-robed woman gave the bearded, middle-aged
man who just spoke a hard look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the Primal
Daoists were chatting amongst themselves, they were also using their
divine senses to investigate what was going on within each of the
mountain tunnels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, it’s
Bloodrinker Bladask.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The corridor which
Ji Ning chose is guarded by that kid, Bladask? He’s quite arrogant.
He definitely won’t make it easy for Ji Ning to pass through.”
The Primal Daoists all leisurely watched the events going on through
the eight corridors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the corridor
Ning had chosen. Roughly a hundred meters past the entrance, there
was a white-robed youth. This youth had three bloodstains on the side
of his chest. A white vest, with three drops of blood on the
chest…only the genius disciples who had acquired the legacy of the
Bloodrinker clan were qualified to wear this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodrinker
clan…was one of the supreme tribes that was located outside of
Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They had me stand
guard?” The white-robed youth, Bladask, just stood there, a flying
sword hovering around his body. He gently stretched out a finger and
tapped it. Rumble…a sword hymn instantly filled the cave. He
couldn’t help but close his eyes, revealing a look of enjoyment on
his face. “No matter how much of a genius you are, you can forget
about successfully passing through the tunnel I have chosen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodrinker Bladask’s
arrogance made it so that he definitely would not permit any juniors
of the early Zifu Disciple stage to successfully pass through his
cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single sword…they
only permitted me to use this single sword. Still, it will be
enough.” The white-robed youth tapped the sword again, and the
sword hummed out in response, as though it were behaving coquettishly
towards him. He couldn’t help but smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the day he was
born, he had held a wooden sword as he slept. His parents had named
him ‘Bladask’, and in the past thirty years, he had focused all
of his efforts on his blade. He was at the point where he was his
blade, and the blade was him. Although he was in possession of the
consummate skills of the Bloodrinker clan, the clan had still sent
him to the Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery. He had lived
up to their expectations and had entered the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
The white-clothed youth sensed the impending ripples. Suddenly, he
heard a resigned voice ring out from outside. “Nine corridors,
eight contestants. Mine ends up being the only one with no
selectee…my fellow disciples, I hope that none of you will let
these juniors make it through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
senior apprentice-brother Ox.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ox, how sad for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve waited all
this time for nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ox, although I’m only permitted a single magic
treasure, these juniors definitely won’t be able to pass through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One voice after another
rang out in response. Bladask also shouted back, “Junior
apprentice-brother Ox, please wait just a moment. After I turn back
this kid, we’ll go back together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Footsteps rang out.
Bladask immediately stared forward carefully. He saw, from afar, a
figure emerge from the depths of the tunnel. A youth with delicate,
handsome features emerged, holding a sword in each hand, dressed in
furs, and a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior.”
Bloodrinker Bladask tapped the flying sword in front of him, and the
sword hummed in response. Bladask said calmly, “In the future,
remember this clearly - the one who prevented you from entering the
Black-White College is me, Bloodrinker Bladask.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am…” Ning was
about to say something, but Bladask interrupted calmly, “No need to
tell me. We won’t meet again. You don’t need to give me your
name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. How
arrogant. Since this was the case…then he might as well just go
ahead and win this quickly and cleanly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the lightning
descend!” Bladask called out softly, and as soon as he did, that
flying sword in front of him began to emit a thundering sound. One
bolt of lightning actually appeared in the surrounding area, all
swirling around that flying sword, then flooding towards Ning with
shocking power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strength of this
blow alone was far superior to the power of Adept Xu Li and the
Monoceros. The sword seemed to have transformed into countless bolts
of lightning, striking at an astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the lotus flower
bloom.” Ning had a faint smile on his face. Instantly, Waterflame
Lotuses appeared around him. One layer after another of the flower
bloomed; a total of six layers of flowers appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle crackle
crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword of lightning
cut directly through all six layers, but its speed had clearly
dropped somewhat. Ning’s Darknorth swords swept out in a
deceivingly simple manner, deflecting that powerful, vicious sword
blow to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
frowned slightly. It had appeared as though he had received that blow
with ease, but in reality, his hand had cracked slightly at the point
between his thumb and index finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you do have some
ability. It is useless, however!” Bladask suddenly let out a loud
roar. “Thundergod’s Hell!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying sword
continued to hang there in midair, but around it, one violet bolt of
lightning after another appeared. These bolts of serpentine lightning
zigzagged into the shape of a prison, and a powerful pressure filled
the entire caverns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Feel proud that you
were defeated by this technique of mine,” Bladask said coldly.
“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thundergod Prison
technique flew rapidly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College’s disciples live up to their reputation. With but a single
flying sword, he’s still able to unleash such power and activate so
much of the energy of the world.” Ning mentally sighed in praise as
made one flying sword after another appear in the area around him. In
total, 729 flying swords emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sword formation!”
The distant Bladask’s face changed. Anything that had to do with
the word ‘formation’ could not be belittled, and there were many
swords in this one. If one could perfectly focus all of the energy
into a whole, then the power of that one blow would be explosive! As
a disciple of the Black-White College, Bladask naturally also was in
possession of sword formation techniques, but for the purposes of
this assignment, he was only able to use a single sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 729 flying swords
hung there in the air. Amongst them, there were eighty one
Mortal-ranked flying swords; they included the Nine Yang Sword
Formation swords that Ning had acquired from the underwater estate,
and the seventy two flying swords Ning had acquired after killing
Adept Xu Li. Although he had some other other Mortal-ranked flying
swords as well, there weren’t enough of them, and they were all
varied and different in nature. Thus, Ning didn’t use them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine flying swords
of the Nine Yang Swords served as the core formation base, while the
other seventy two Mortal-ranked flying swords, all of which came from
the same origin, swirled around them, forming a grand formation of
eighty one flying swords. They, in turn, guided the six hundred-plus
unranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” Ning’s
elemental ki filled those flying swords and was transformed by them.
His divine soul, which was at the divine sense level, was completely
capable of controlling all of these swords, and soon, in front of his
chest, a shocking, awe-inspiringly powerful sword light appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
technique was now truly astonishing. The reason why it was so strong
was primarily because of those nine incredibly rare flying swords he
had acquired from the underwater estate. Every single one of them was
comparable to an Earth-ranked magic treasure, and they all came from
the same source, which was even rarer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning willed
the attack. Swish! The sword light, now completely in the shape of a
real flying sword, shot out through the air, forcibly slashing open
the impending prison of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Moments later,
the lightning prison detonated in awe-inspiring fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go, go.” Ning
hurriedly executed three more attacks of sword light, striking out in
succession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Bladask’s face changed dramatically. He was a peak Zifu Disciple,
after all, while Ning, by controlling and transforming his ki through
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] and forming it into his sword
light, had a purity of ki that was comparable to a Wanxiang Adept’s.
In terms of sword techniques…Bladask was of the Bloodrinker clan
and was an elite member of the Black-White College; naturally, he was
formidable. But in terms of true insight and comprehension, Ning was
on an even higher level. Thus, when Ning activated his [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], Bladask actually was at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Polaris.” Bladask
had no other choice. In an instant, seven flying swords appeared,
flashing with lightning. The seven flying swords swirled around him,
forming into the pattern of an enormous constellation; it was the
Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Down!” Bladask
growled. Bang! Bang! Bang! Ning’s three flashes of sword light were
all shattered by the slowly revolving Seven Stars of the Northern
Dipper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Bladask
turned his head, collected his flying swords, then transformed into a
ray of light and departed. Per the rules, he was only permitted to
use a single flying sword…since he had been forced to bring out his
other magic treasures, he had naturally lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How formidable.”
Ning watched as that disciple of Black-White College, ‘Bloodrinker
Bladask’, departed. He couldn’t help but sigh in amazement. “The
school should have limited him to using just a single flying sword.
As soon as he showed his real power…he instantly suppressed my
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. He’s a peak Zifu Disciple,
after all, while I am an early stage Zifu Disciple. The difference in
elemental ki strength…when I encounter another unparalleled genius,
the difference is clear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
realize…was that actually, all he had to do was fly out of the
cave. And yet, he had insisted on forcing the guardian to show his
real power instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College.” Ning slowly strolled forward, walking out of the cave. He
stepped onto a flying boat, then stared at the boundless, beautiful
mountain scenery around him. From this day forward, he would truly be
a member of the Black-White College.

Chapter 20 - Ji Ning, Disciple of the Black-White College
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Primal Daoists
at the entrance to the caves were roaring with laughter.
“Hahahaha…this Ji Ning really is formidable. He lives up to his
reputation as someone who has gained insight into a Dao Domain. That
sword formation technique…although I’ve never heard of it, it
clearly is an extremely complicated and powerful sword formation. For
it to control more than seven hundred swords…the demands it must
place on his soul and on his level of comprehension are definitely
extremely, extremely high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, chubby old
man shook his head. “He, an early stage Zifu Disciple Ki Refiner,
was able to force the peak Zifu-level Bloodrinker Bladask to release
his own sword formation to block it. Bladask didn’t have any face
to remain after that, and so he immediately left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He clearly could’ve
just charged out of the cave, but he insisted on fighting one-on-one,
fighting to the point where he forced the guardian disciple to
voluntarily retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Primal Daoists
all sighed with praise. Naturally, all of them took a liking to such
a formidable disciple. This meant that their Black-White College
would rise in power yet again. Centuries later, perhaps the
Black-White College would produce yet another formidable Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We must provide him
with good guidance and tutelage. This Ji Ning has the potential to
become an Immortal,” the black-haired, middle-aged man said. The
white-robed woman nodded. “Indeed, he must be properly guided. He
can’t be pampered; if we end up ruining this piece of unpolished
jade, that would be a huge waste.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tutelage was an art all
its own. Geniuses were naturally endowed with arrogance and pride,
and the path of Immortals was that of the three calamities and nine
tribulations. One would grow up in the midst of battle, and there was
no way one could avoid establishing grudges with anyone. All these
things could possibly result in a genius perishing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode atop his
boat, moving straight to the very peak of the mountain. “A total of
eight people went for the trial. I wonder how many passed.” Ning
continued to wait there. “I wonder if that Mu Northson was able to
pass or not.” Of the others, the only one who Ning had spoken with
was Northson, and he had quite a good impression of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a ray of
light flew towards Ning, followed by yet another ray of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, someone passed?
Which cave was it? Which of our fellow disciples was guarding that
cave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared into the
distance. He could just barely make out the appearance of a disciple
of the Black-White College. That disciple gave Ning a few curious
glances, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
Whoooosh. That distant ray of light shot over; it was an Azure Dragon
construct. “Mu Northson.” Ning was surprised, then immediately
clasped his hands. “Congratulations, felicitations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same to you, same to
you.” The white-robed youth, Northson, landed and stored away his
construct, his face filled with joy. “Brother Ji Ning, you truly
are formidable. I was nearly defeated, but in the end, I finally
managed to charge out of the caves. But you were even more
formidable; you made it out so quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
joy radiating out from Northson as he spoke. His eyes were filled
with excitement as well. “Success. I’ve finally become a disciple
of the Black-White College. If Mother finds out, she will definitely
be very happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, his gaze growing distant. If his own mother knew that he had
become a disciple of the Black-White College, she would definitely be
proud as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father…mother…just
wait and see. I, Ji Ning, will definitely have my name be spread
throughout these vast lands. I will become one of the supreme
existences of this world. Definitely! Those disciples of Snowdragon
Mountain who caused your deaths…I will definitely execute them
all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Six
figures flew out in an arcing pattern, laughing as they did so. They
instantly arrived at the top of the mountain. It was the six Primal
Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, pudgy, bald
one laughed, “This year, our Black-White College has taken in quite
a few disciples; two at once!” The black-haired, middle-aged man
said, “Today’s only the first day. We still have two more days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Everyone
capable of joining our Black-White College is a true, unparalleled
genius. Geniuses like that are all supremely confident; if they were
to join, they would make us their very first choice. Thus, they would
come on the first day.” The short, pudgy, bald man shook his head.
“It’s been so many years; how many people ended up joining our
Black-White College on the second or third days? If they did, it was
only because they were delayed slightly and unable to make it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired,
middle-aged man looked towards Ning and Northson. “Ji Ning. Mu
Northson. The two of you, starting today, are now the disciples of
our Black-White College.” Ning and Northson both felt surges of joy
in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The grand ceremony
of formal apprenticeship will occur after the next two days of
recruitment are finished.” The black-haired man waved his hand, and
two insignias appeared. One side of each insignia was white, while
the other side was black. “This is the insignia of our Black-White
College’s disciples. You can bind it now, and in the future, you
will be able to freely enter many of the locations of the Black-White
College without being attacked by the various restrictive formations
within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
Northson each accepted an insignia. They naturally were able to
easily bond it, and upon doing so, Ning could immediately sense that
there was a grand formation throughout the entire Black-White
College. He could sense…that this was a terrifying formation
indeed. It encompassed the entire college…and he could sense that
it acknowledged him. Ning felt as though this insignia was quite
similar to the control talisman for the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A disciple of the
Black-White College.” Ning looked at the insignia. How many people
desired this insignia? That Hua Chong, the black-clothed youth who
had also trained to the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens]…he had failed, in the end. There were also
several other geniuses who were even more talented than Hua Chong,
but they had been eliminated as well. Only Ning and Northson had been
accepted as disciples of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu Xiu, we’ll let
you make the arrangements for their residences. We’re going back
now,” the bearded, middle-aged man grinned. “Yes, we’re
leaving.” The other Primal Daoists immediately flew into the air,
quickly departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired,
middle-aged man waved his hand. A mist instantly arose, lifting up
the three of them. “Let’s go.” The black-haired Wu Xiu
immediately guided Ning and Northson to fly forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire
Black-White College is divided into multiple areas, and it has many
rules.” Wu Xiu waved his hand, then took out two books which he
tossed to them. “This book has the rules of our Black-White
College, as well as some other things which you must know. You must
memorize everything within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
accepted the book. Lowering their heads, they saw just two words on
the book; ‘Black’ and ‘White’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the peak of a
small mountain, there was a graceful little villa. There were
multiple buildings surrounding it, but at the peak of this little
mountain, Ning was the only person present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
I am the master of this peak.” Ning stood in midair, staring down
at his mountain peak. Because the Black-White College had so few
formal disciple, one could choose any mountain one wanted to become
one’s estate. Ning thus selected this one, giving it the name
‘Darknorth Peak’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth…this was
also the name of the swords he wielded. They symbolized that he would
embark on a path of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth. This also
was the place where his parents had met and fallen in love. This was
a way of memorializing his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother…”
Ning was silent for quite some time as he reminisced. And then, he
turned his head and immediately flew towards the skies atop his
flying boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, he arrived at the
formal gates to the Black-White College. His Uncle White had been
waiting here the entire time. Ning immediately saw that large, snowy
white dog who was quietly waiting by the side of the lake. The
Whitewater Hound was simply standing there, waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
immediately charged down. The Whitewater Hound lifted his head, a
questioning look in his eyes. “It’s done.” Ning landed, then
nodded. “I’m already a disciple of the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Big Brother
Yichuan knew this, he would definitely be ecstatic.” The Whitewater
Hound’s eyes became filled with delight and excitement as well. The
Black-White College! What sort of a school was this? The status of a
formal disciple of Black-White College was far higher than that of a
Wanxiang Adept of an ordinary school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Brother Ji
Ning, you only have eyes for this spirit-beast of yours. You didn’t
even notice me.” A voice rang out, and Ning immediately turned to
look. There was a carriage parked before the gates, and Northmont
Baiwei was descending from that carriage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwei.”
Ning immediately went to greet him. Baiwei said, “I expected that
you would definitely become a disciple of the Black-White College, so
I predicted that you would return at around nightfall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for making you
wait so long, Brother Baiwei,” Ning said. Baiwei’s eyes radiated
excitement as he spoke. “Not long at all. You have no idea how
happy I was as I waited. Especially towards the end, when those other
geniuses emerged, like Hua Chong, Liu Shuilian…they have been
famous for quite some time now, but in the end, all of them had been
eliminated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
“Hua Chong and the others you mentioned; they should have been
eliminated after the final trial.” Ning had a fairly deep
impression regarding Hua Chong, who also had reached the seventh
stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and whose
aunt was a Primal Daoist of the school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, they
all slunk away in defeat,” Baiwei said. “In the end…the
Skysplitter Sword Sect, the Hundred Flowers Fairyland, and the other
schools will still accept many disciples. Given their talent, they
can easily enter. Only the Black-White College…unless one is truly
a supreme, unparalleled genius, they won’t accept them. Even the
most talented of geniuses must undergo a thorough examination. Given
their pride, of course they came. What a pity, what a pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no hint of
pity on the face of Baiwei at all; all he had on his face was a look
of schadenfreude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. How many
disciples did the Black-White College accept this time?” Baiwei
hurriedly asked. “Today was the first day. They took in two
disciples,” Ning replied. “I was one. Another is named Mu
Northson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei nodded lightly.
“Mu Northson? This is a name I’ve never heard of before. It seems
as though some of the backwater, out-of-the-way areas will
occasionally produce a supreme genius from time to time. When you are
free, why don’t you bring this Mu Northson over? We’ll meet and
make friends with each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Easily done,” Ning
nodded. Baiwei said, “I came for two reasons. First, to
congratulate you on becoming a disciple of the Black-White College.
Secondly, to ask you for some help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “As
long as I can help, I will.” Baiwei looked at Ning. “Here’s the
situation. You should know that formal disciples of the Black-White
College are permitted to bring in ten retainers with them, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Ten
retainers…to be a retainer of a disciple of the Black-White College
was far more alluring a position than being a disciple of an ordinary
school. This was because the retainer would live within the
Black-White College! Even though it would be very, very hard for them
to acquire any techniques, anything they did acquire would be
supreme, top-tier techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loan me three of
those positions,” Baiwei said. “You should know that I have many
family and friends. There are many that I will find hard to reject,
once they ask me to help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Why
the courtesy? Of the ten positions, you can take nine of them. Just
leave one for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That one…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thought back to
Meng Roch, who he had encountered on the road to Stillwater City. He
knew that after Roch had used a forbidden technique, he had
definitely harmed his own foundation. He would most likely find it
hard to join any school.

Chapter 21 - Viewing the Sculpture at Night
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave you with just
one?” Baiwei hurriedly shook his head. “How can I do that?
Although your Ji clan isn’t too large, you still have people who
broke through to the Zifu Disciple level. I imagine some of them
would wish to become a retainer for a full disciple of the
Black-White College. In addition, in the future, you might encounter
a powerful figure who would ask you for a slot. How about this; I’ll
shamelessly take five of your retainer positions, while you hold on
to the remaining five. If, in the future, the five you have is
insufficient, come talk to me…I’ll come up with some methods for
having those Zifu Disciples enter a good school. But of course, they
must be of the early Zifu stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
nodded. “That’s fine as well.” But in truth, he really did only
need a single slot. Retainers entered the Black-White College for the
sake of gaining top-tier Ki Refining techniques, but they ideally
needed to be early stage Zifu Disciples as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one entered as a
middle stage or late stage Zifu Disciple, one’s path would have
become set; there was no way to go back! The Ji clan’s Zifu
Disciples consisted of Patriarch Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, Ah Xing,
and Ji Truekeep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch and the
others were all peak Zifu Disciples, while Truekeep was a middle
stage Zifu Disciple; their paths were already set. As for the younger
members of the Ji clan? For one of them to reach the Zifu Disciple
would probably need some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if our Ji clan
is capable of producing a new Zifu Disciple, they can still rely on
their own power to join another sect,” Ning mused to himself. “If
my help is truly needed, in a few years, my power and status will
most likely be higher as well.” In his heart, though, Ning wanted
to let those future descendants of the Ji clan fight for their paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At most, he would
occasionally give them some opportunities! Only when one adventured
through the world by one’s self would one not fear the wind and the
waves of life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Baiwei
nodded. “In two days, after the Black-White College has concluded
its recruitment cycle, I will send five Zifu Disciples to you, as
well as some ordinary commoners.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary commoners?”
Ning was startled. Baiwei smiled. “Given how few in number the
formal disciples of the Black-White College are, each of them take up
an entire mountain for themselves…although the Zifu Disciple are
servants and retainers, they still have to train as well. You can’t
make them spend all their time boiling water, watering the plants, or
doing cleaning, right? You can give them some important tasks, but
for the normal tasks, you can have the commoners carry it out.”
Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t tarry any
longer. Take a good stroll around the Black-White College.” Baiwei
laughed. “The Black-White Diagram of the Black-White College has
attracted jealousy from countless powers for many years now. Even the
Grand Xia Dynasty will occasionally send people over here, begging
for a chance to see the Black-White Diagram. Only formal disciples
like you, however, can view it whenever you want.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Baiwei
laughed then entered his carriage, departing. Ning turned to look at
the Whitewater Hound by his side. “Uncle White, let’s go.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded, following him. “Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The man and the
snowy white hound both boarded a flying boat, then sped into the air
at high speed. It was already dark. The Black-White College, shrouded
by the night sky, appeared incomparably tranquil.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White,” Ning
laughed, “You are at the early Zifu stage. Don’t be in a hurry to
train. Soon, I will ask the school for a top-tier Ki Refining
technique for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thanks for taking
the trouble, Ning, son.” The Whitewater Hound looked at Ning. That
child who had ridden atop his back while training in archery in the
mountains had already grown up. Had become even more powerful than
the hound’s elder brother, Ji Yichuan. “Yichuan…I will watch as
Ning becomes a truly majestic, heroic figure within these lands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t know what
his Uncle White was thinking. He instructed, “Uncle White, your
status within the College will be that of my spirit-beast, and so
you’ll be able to follow me around and listen to some Primal
Daoists and even Immortals expound on the Dao. When following me,
you’ll also be able to enter the various parts of the Black-White
College. If you are moving about by yourself, however, you’ll only
be able to enter these places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand and
retrieved that black-and-white book, flipping to one of the pages
within it. “This is the map of the Black-White College; there are
red lines marking the places where you, Uncle White, can go freely,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
gave it a quick look, memorizing everything. “Thanks for taking the
trouble, Ning.” Ning laughed. “No trouble at all.” When he
looked at Uncle White, he felt as though he had returned to those
days when he had lived together with Uncle White, Father, and Mother.
His parents were now gone…and Uncle White was his closest family
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spirit-beasts and
retainers were different. Retainers who wanted to train in top-tier
techniques had to work hard for themselves and be acknowledged by the
Black-White College; only then might they have the rare chance to
acquire a top-tier Ki Refining technique. In addition, they would
only have access to a small number of top-tier Ki Refining
techniques. The retainers had to do everything for themselves. For
the formal disciples to allow them to enter the Black-White College
alongside them was kindness enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Uncle White had
entered the Black-White College as a retainer, he too could’ve
relied on his own power, but things would have been very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for spirit-beasts,
spirit-beasts themselves absolutely could not acquire top-tier Ki
Refining techniques. But Ning, by paying a certain price, could ask
for a Ki Refining technique for him. It was incomparably easier for a
formal disciple to acquire a top-tier Ki Refining technique, compared
to a retainer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given how
exacting the requirements the Black-White College placed upon its
formal disciples, they couldn’t hurry fast enough to learn
techniques and arts; how many of them would be willing to sacrifice
their own advancement chances for the sake of their spirit-beasts?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” The boat
flew to the top of Darknorth Peak. “This is Darknorth Peak.” Ning
pointed down towards the mountain peak below. “From today onwards,
this peak shall belong to me, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, the
only people living at Darknorth Peak for now are you and me. Go and
get some rest. I’m going to the restricted area of the Black-White
Diagram to take a look,” Ning said. “The Black-White Diagram is
located in the innermost reaches of the entire Black-White College.
Only formal disciples may go view it. Retainers and spirit-beasts are
not permitted to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
Whitewater Hound laughed, then leapt downwards from the boat,
transforming into a streak of light that landed atop Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Whoooosh.
His ship immediately turned and flew towards another direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning descended from the
skies. This was a very wide square, and the innermost heart of the
entire Black-White College, a restricted area amongst restricted
areas. Even the Grand Xia Dynasty or the various supreme powers would
have to strive mightily and use all their connections they had in
order to come view this Black-White Diagram. Retainers and
spirit-beasts were naturally forbidden to come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
Diagram?” Ning stared at the giant stone wall that was erected
within the center of the square. The stone was of an unknown type; it
radiated an inky black aura, and was covered with dense,
crisscrossing black and white lines that formed countless structures.
These two different colored lines intersected in innumerable ways,
but in doing so formed the image of an enormous, circular bedstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black. White. It was
like the night and the day. Like yin and yang. Like water and fire.
Like darkness and light…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Pangu’s creation
of the universe, everything in the universe had a ‘dark’ side and
a ‘light’ side; upon seeing those crisscrossing lines, Ning felt
as though a powerful aura was surging towards him, and he immediately
even felt his soul begin to ache in pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not right.”
Ning hurriedly turned around. “The Black-White Diagram actually has
so many different lines all tangled together.” Ning was secretly
amazed. The Stellar Hall of his underwater estate allowed the various
Dao Paths to be completely condensed into separate lines, so that
those within could separately focus on comprehending these various
Daos. But as for this Black-White College…it mixed in countless
Daos, and some were only fragmentary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But those various
fragmentary Daos, when mixed with the other Daos…actually formed
this complete Black-White Bedstone Diagram!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although in terms of
comprehending the Dao, this Black-White Diagram is inferior to the
Stellar Hall of the underwater estate…in terms of how the various
Daos complement and connect with each other, this Black-White Diagram
is actually on a higher level.” Ning understood, however, that the
Stellar Hall was comparatively far more valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was one’s
foundation; swordplay and techniques were all extraneous. When Ning
had risen in comprehension and gained the Dao Domain, he had done so
because he had risen in his understanding of his Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the likes of the
Waterflame Lotus, it was a technique that was fused from aspects of
various different True Meanings of the Dao; it was a matter of
applying the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was the
foundation. Techniques were an application. The Stellar Hall…it
separated the various different Daos, allowing others to clearly
comprehend them. Its value was priceless, and it was the reason why
Immortal Juhua, a Loose Immortal, was able to live for millions of
years, so that even the princes of the Grand Xia Dynasty sought to
become his disciple to no avail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White Diagram
was most likely formed by nature itself, and thus contained many
different things within it. It allowed others to easily gain insights
into some of those things and develop certain techniques, such as the
Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” An Azure Dragon construct, a figure on
its back, descended from the skies. It was Mu Northson. “I didn’t
expect you’d arrive even earlier than me, senior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson.” Ning laughed, then instructed, “No
matter what, don’t stare directly at that Black-White Diagram. The
Daos contained by the Black-White Diagram are simply too vast and
unfathomable; we aren’t capable of withstanding them. Just look at
a small part of it at a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, his
words were slightly too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had
landed, Northson had unconsciously glanced at the Black-White
Diagram; naturally, in doing so, he had stared at the entire thing.
Instantly, he felt the world start to spin, and his body began to
slump and fall from the Azure Dragon construct. Clearly, in terms of
the strength of his soul, he was far inferior to Ning, and so his
ability to withstand the Black-White Diagram was weaker as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing Ning’s words,
Northson hurriedly nodded. “Right. We can’t stare directly at the
entire Black-White Diagram.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s view
it slowly.” Ning immediately walked past the stone wall. He stood
next to the Black-White Diagram and began to inspect it closely.
Actually, next to it, there were two other walls to the left and to
the right of it, made from similarly unusual materials which radiated
white light. Ning could sense that these three stone walls all had
incredibly powerful formations overlaid atop them; most likely, the
Immortals of the entire Black-White College paid extremely close
attention to this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the
Black-White College had only risen to power after acquiring the
Black-White Diagram. This was their life, their heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each new Immortal of
the Black-White College had frenetically added their own powerful
formations to seal the diagram, causing it to become terrifyingly
powerful by now. Upon being activated, the formations of countless
elders of the Black-White College would simultaneously explode. Most
likely, even Celestial Immortals would find it hard to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A three-sided wall.
One is the Black-White Diagram, while the other two must have been
left behind by the previous Immortals.” Ning glanced at it all. The
three-sided stone walls were all more than three hundred meters wide,
and they were covered with dense, clustered words, most likely more
than ten thousand utterances. From this, one could estimate how many
Immortals had been born from the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze quickly
halted at one of the corners of the Black-White Diagram. He began
staring at a small part of it, focusing on that part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white lines and
black lines intersected…they were opposite, and yet alike. A
sensation of the marvels of nature completely engulfed Ning.
Northson, by his side, was absorbed by the Black-White Diagram as
well.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - The Words Left By An Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Throughout the history
of the Black-White College, whenever a disciple came to view the
Black-White Diagram for the first time, they would gain from it. The
experience they had accumulated normally, the insights they had
gained normally…upon viewing the Black-White Diagram, they would
gain corresponding enlightenment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle, rustle, rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position, meditating as Waterflame Lotuses began to form around
him. One petal after another blossomed, slowly swiveling about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of six layers
of petals had formed…but suddenly, all six layers vanished,
reforming into four layers which appeared even more real and solid
than the six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, an hour passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. The four quite
solid-seeming layers of petals vanished as well, reforming into a
total of two layers of petals. One of two layers of lotus petals was
formed from red petals, while the other was formed from green petals.
The two looked identical to the lotus petals of a real lotus flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lotus flower slowly
swiveled, and the grinding, killing power of the two layers of lotus
petals grew increasingly powerful. The lotus petals became
increasingly clear and lifelike, especially the green lotus petals;
slowly, it continued to grow so lifelike that one could see the plant
veins as well. Even at close range, most would probably take it to be
a naturally grown lotus petal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
woke up, then nodded gently. “I gained from my previously
accumulated experiences. It seems as though my understanding of the
Dao has reached a bottleneck in terms of being able to combine water,
fire, and wind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked towards the
nearby Mu Northson. Northson was still absorbed in his trance,
appearing either drunk or mesmerized. “I have the Stellar Hall in
my underwater estate. Although the Black-White Diagram is of use to
me, it isn’t as useful as it was to Northson.” Ning turned to
walk to the stone wall on the other side. This wall was covered with
words left behind by countless generations of Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One row after another
of words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation is the Dao of the grand struggle. These are the words of
Five Disgraces!” The powerful intent that surged forth from these
characters made Ning feel as though he could see an Immortal
cultivator who was constantly advancing, struggling against the
heavens, against the earth, against other men, against monsters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Consider all things
carefully, but act with bravery and resoluteness.” An invisible,
grim callousness radiated from these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where my heart leads
me is where I shall go.” A confident, prideful aura radiated from
these words, as though no one could block him from moving forward on
the path which his Dao-heart had decided upon. Any who tried would be
slaughtered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All mortal and
worldly things shall decay; I ask for just two words; Immortal Life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Domineering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Leisurely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The words left behind
by the Immortals of the Black-White Diagram caused Ning’s Dao-heart
to be baptized time and time again. He felt as though he could look
past time itself to ages past; as though he could watch as these
Immortal cultivators held firm to their own Dao-hearts and embarked
on their own paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such powerful,
resolved, and untainted Dao-hearts,” Ning murmured to himself.
Power. Resolve. Purity. These were the things Ning sensed from the
words left behind by these Immortals. Anyone capable of becoming an
Immortal had understood his or her own heart long ago, and knew what
their heart’s desire was! In addition, their Dao-hearts would be
incomparably pure and resolved; they wouldn’t succumb to
temptations or let themselves be led astray. The passage of countless
years had caused their Dao-hearts to grow incomparably strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if the Dao-hearts
of these Immortals somehow grew bewildered, then their faith in
themselves would collapse, and they might lose everything they had
built up over a thousand years! In fact, in the worst case scenarios,
they might not even be able to control the incomparably powerful
elemental ki in their bodies, resulting in death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
see that the path of Immortal cultivation was an extremely difficult
path; it was the path of challenging destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only desire in
my heart is to be carefree, to be able to do as I please. I only ask
that my destiny be in my own hands.” As Ning continued to read, his
own Dao-heart grew increasingly pure as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pain and agony he
had suffered in his previous life made it so that he was not willing
to submit to fate. Not willing to allow his destiny to be controlled
by others. In this life, his parents had both died; this caused Ning
to feel an even greater desire for the ability to not be controlled
by destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if one wished
to surpass the bonds of fate, then one would have to gain tremendous
power! Only by being powerful would one truly be carefree and be able
to act as one pleased!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read the words of
one Immortal after another. Although Immortal cultivators read very
quickly, by the time he finished reading that section of the wall, it
was already very late at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
to look at Northson. Northson continued to sit there in the lotus
position, staring at the Black-White Diagram. Around him were various
parts and pieces that were formed from natural, elemental energy. The
countless parts and pieces sometimes joined together and sometimes
split apart, forming dragons, tigers, serpents, turtles…all sorts
of monstrous beasts and strange creatures appeared, constantly
forming and reforming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s making a
breakthrough. Junior apprentice-brother Northson’s insights have
reached a tipping point.” Ning felt secret admiration; he had spent
less than two hours in meditation, but his junior apprentice-brother
Northson had spent far more time than he had in comprehending the
Black-White Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other stone
wall.” Ning turned to look at the final, third stone wall. The
words left behind by the various Immortals were actually meant to
help refine the Dao-hearts of their successors. For juniors whose
Dao-hearts were not sufficiently stable, it could have the effect of
helping them to constantly train and test their hearts. Thus,
although the Black-White Diagram served as the foundation of the
Black-White College, the words left behind by these Immortals to
train the Dao-hearts of their successors could also be considered one
of the important things which this supreme, top-tier school relied
upon as it passed down its traditions over the course of countless
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This, too, was their
foundation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The night sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short old man,
dressed in ragged beggar’s clothes, stood atop the clouds, holding
a calabash of wine and appearing quite at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He seemed to be the
very center of the world around him, as though everything would obey
his commands. This natural feeling of dominance, of power…it gave
the short old man an aura that was definitely not inferior to
Northmont Blacktiger’s, and perhaps even more astonishing and
terrifying. However, as long as one was not too close to him, one
couldn’t sense his majestic presence at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve overcome the
ninth-century tribulation… what a wonderful, wonderful feeling.”
The short old man shook his head, seeming completely delighted with
himself. “I’ll have nine hundred more years of good living.”
Raising his head, he gargled in a large mouthful of Immortal wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh?” The short old
man suddenly halted, staring down at the Black-White Diagram below
him. “Two youngsters?” The short old man nodded slightly. “Come
to think of it, today is the day in which our Black-White College is
accepting new recruits. It seems these two are new disciples. This
old Daoist wants to take a good look at them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That white-robed
kid…he walks the Dao of Constructs? And he seems quite impressive;
quite talented, in fact. It seems as though although I have been in
seclusion for many years, the quality of the disciples of our
Black-White College hasn’t dropped in the slightest.” The old man
nodded in satisfaction, then turned his gaze towards Ji Ning, who was
staring at the the stone wall with writing atop it. “That kid
dressed in furs; he’s actually reading those words that were left
behind? Can it be that he has finished viewing the Black-White
Diagram? I wonder how long that kid viewed the Black-White Diagram
for, and how his potential is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longer one was able
to view the Black-White Diagram, the more one would gain from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to read
the words left behind by the Immortals on the wall. Every single
character was a representation of the path an Immortal had followed.
Amongst these Immortals, there was only a single Celestial Immortal;
the rest were all Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals. From this, one
could tell how difficult it was for someone to truly escape the
confines of the Three Realms and no longer be bound by the Five
Elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards a
new line of words, but as soon as his gaze fell upon it, he suddenly
felt as though a sword was being pointed at his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My three-foot sword
in hand, I shall exterminate all injustices! These are the words of
Northwalker!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A very simple line of
words. Ning stared at this line of words, left behind by Immortal
Northwalker, and could vaguely sense the powerful energy emanating
from these words. As Ning carefully sensed and probed it with his own
soul, instantly, a powerful aura instantly sprang out from these
words, completely filling his consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver-haired old man
stood in the void, a sword in his hand. Hua! His entire body became
filled with a heaven-towering sword ki, as though he himself had
transformed into an enormous sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a sharp sword.”
When Ning saw the silver-haired elder, he had the feeling as though
the elder himself was a sword as well, and the most indestructible,
the toughest, the most overbearing sword in existence at that. In
fact, Ning even felt as though nothing could possibly withstand this
silver-haired elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trained in the
sword ever since he was young. The sword was the weapon of his
choice, and his father had personally taught him. By now, Ning had
the heart of a true swordsman. When he saw this figure, who appeared
to be the utmost embodiment of that which swordsmen aspired to
become…the desire Ning felt in his heart and the sincerity he felt
towards the sword slowly began to transform, causing that aura that
had filled him to begin to resonate with him..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? That fur-clad
little…” The short old man in the clouds above stared down in
shock. “Is this…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in the plaza
below, was standing next to one of the giant stone wall, and on that
stone wall, a certain line of characters was slowly beginning to glow
and radiate light. The characters were, ‘My three-foot sword in
hand, I shall exterminate all injustices! These are the words of
Northwalker!’. Every single character was lighting up, and a
powerful sword-intent completely filled each and every one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
his entire body faintly radiating a sword intent as well. The two had
actually begun to resonate with each other. The sword-intent
radiating from Ning was far from being able to compare to the
heaven-shaking profoundness of the line of characters, but without
question, the sword-intent radiating from him was resonating with
that of the wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually…he
actually managed to activate the sword-intent ripples left behind by
senior Northwalker?” The short elder stared downwards in
astonishment. Although Immortal Northwalker was a Loose Immortal, it
could be said that within the Black-White College, his status was
comparable to that Celestial Immortal’s, and in fact, his influence
was even a bit greater. He had lived for over a million years before
finally perishing under the weight of the increasingly powerful
heaven-sent Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Loose Immortal who
had survived for a million years? This was something out of the
legends. Loose Immortals capable of surviving for a hundred thousand
years were already incredibly powerful figures; afterwards, surviving
for another hundred thousand would be very difficult. Loose Immortals
that had survived for two hundred thousand years and three hundred
thousand years…they were all completely different, but the longer
they lived, the more terrifying their power was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loose Immortals who
crossed the threshold of one million years were absolutely comparable
to Celestial Immortals. However, in terms of the foundation of their
elemental ki, they were clearly weaker than Celestial Immortals; the
reason they were said to be comparable was because in terms of their
comprehension of the Dao, their degree of enlightenment, and their
techniques, they were superior to Celestial Immortals! This was why,
despite being mere Loose Immortals, they were comparable to Celestial
Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword-intent? The
sword-intent ripples are this strong?” The short old man stared,
wide-eyed, at the scene below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s
consciousness. The sword-intents of himself and the words had reached
an astonishing level of resonance. The figure of that silver-haired
elder in his mind…suddenly began to move and display sword
techniques. At the same time, he began to chant out the words to a
song.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the purpose
of a life lived?” <BR> “All I ask for is to be joyful.” <BR>
“Kill, kill, kill.” <BR> “Exterminate all injustices!” <BR>
“Exterminate all those who deserve killing!” <BR> “Only then
will I be exultant.” <BR> “As Loose Immortals, there is no path
to immortality.” <BR> “Thus…” <BR> “Better to live
passionately for a day, than to live a century while stifled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword is the
joyous sword, the sword of passion, the sword which exterminates all
injustices. The name of this sword technique is the [Three-Foot
Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice of the old
man echoed within the vast, empty void of Ning’s consciousness.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Immortal Diancai
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder
clutched that gourd of wine in his hands, but completely forgot to
drink from it. He stared downwards towards the fur-clad youth. The
sword-intent radiating from the youth was incomparably firm and
resolved, and it continuously resonated with the glowing words on the
stone wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Epochal
Transmission!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Northwalker
is transmitting his sword intent to him. And, from the looks of it,
this fur-clad youth seems to be receiving it with ease; clearly, he
too has the heart of a true Sword Immortal.” The short elder took a
deep breath, tamping down his excitement, then turned and sent
mentally with a howl, “Junior apprentice-brother Diancai, hurry the
hell out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry the hell out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry the hell out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice transmitted
through the air, past countless layers of restrictive spells, and
entered the ears of a black-robed, black-haired man who was currently
seated in the lotus position atop a jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-haired man revealed a hint of puzzlement in his eyes as he
opened them. But then, a look of understanding appeared. “It seems
as though senior apprentice-brother Fivecraze has successfully
endured the great tribulation which occurs every nine centuries. And
he seems to be in quite a good mood!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired man took a single step forward, then disappeared from
his room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The night sky. The
black-robed, black-haired man strode through the skies, moving a
hundred kilometers with each step. If one didn’t stare at him
carefully, it would seem as though he wasn’t even present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Fivecraze,” the black-haired, black-clothed man
said. The short old man gave him a glance, blinked, then mumbled to
himself, “You freak. You are growing more and more powerful. It’s
been less than a century since we last met, but you’ve reached such
a level of power. After I entered the Black-White College, you are
the only one I have met who I believe has a great chance of becoming
a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path to becoming
a Celestial Immortal is incomparably difficult. All I can do is
strive as much as I can and to use all my power to attain that goal.”
The black-haired, black-clothed man laughed. “Your junior
apprentice-brother has to congratulate you, senior apprentice-brother
Fivecraze. You once again overcame the nine-century tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t call you
over to chat about becoming a Celestial Immortal.” The short elder
pointed downwards. “Quick, look.” Immortal Diancai stared
downwards. There were two people in the plaza; one was currently
meditating in front of the Black-White Diagram, clearly reaping great
rewards from it, while the other was in front of one of the stone
walls with words left behind by the Immortals. A line of characters
atop that stone wall was currently glowing with light, and the light
from each character was incomparably blinding. At the same time,
surges of deep, powerful sword-intent radiated from the characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The line of words was:
‘My three-foot sword in hand, I shall exterminate all injustices!
These are the words of Northwalker!’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Northwalker’s
Epochal Transmission?” Immortal Diancai was stunned. He was an
absolute genius which even the Black-White College saw only once in a
million years, and the member of the Black-White College with the
greatest chance of becoming a Celestial Immortal. When Immortal
Diancai had originally entered the Black-White College, he, too, had
received an Epochal Transmission from Immortal Northwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, you
received the sword-intent transmission from senior Northwalker,
right?” The short old man laughed. “Right.” Immortal Diancai
stared down carefully towards that fur-clad youth. His gaze was
extremely focused; he was carefully weighing this youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is he?”
Immortal Diancai finally spoke out. The short elder knew that
Immortal Diancai was asking about the fur-clad youth below, and he
shook his head and said, “How should I know? I just came out from
seclusion and happened upon him by chance, and so I immediately
called for you. However, today is the day in which our College
accepts new disciples; I imagine this youth should be a newly
admitted student.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the higher level
members of the Black-White College knew that ever since Immortal
Diancai had entered the school and received the sword-intent
transmission from ‘senior Northwalker’, and had learned about the
life of senior Northwalker, he had felt incomparable respect and
veneration for him. Diancai had considered himself to be
Northwalker’s apprentice, and had frantically sought out any
information he could find about Northwalker, as well as regarding his
sword techniques…he had even visited all of the places which his
revered mastered, Northwalker, had ever travelled to, in the hope of
finding his tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this process,
Immortal Diancai had grown more and more powerful, to the point where
he could be described as the second coming of senior Northwalker. All
the Immortals of the Black-White College acknowledged him as the one
amongst them with the highest chances of becoming a Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well? Will you take
him as your disciple?” The short elder chortled, lifting his gourd
of wine up and taking two drinks. This junior apprentice-brother
Diancai of his had never before accepted a disciple, because junior
apprentice-brother Diancai had once said…only someone who had also
received the Epochal Transmission of senior Northwalker’s
sword-intent could become his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai had
trained for less than a thousand years. During the course of these
thousand years, there had been quite a few who had sensed the
unusualness of that line of characters, but none of them were capable
of receiving the sword-intent transmission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not bad.”
Immortal Diancai nodded gently. “Only…I still need to watch him
to determine whether or not I will take him as a disciple.” The
short old man shook his head. “Your standards really are high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai didn’t
respond. He continued to focus on the fur-clad youth below. He
watched in silence. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
glowing characters on the stone wall suddenly flared with blinding
brilliance, to the point where the characters themselves, formed from
light, seemed to leap out of the stone wall. One character of light
after another hung there in midair. ‘Hand’ ‘Wield’ ‘Three’…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single character
radiated with blinding light; they seemed to be characters, but every
single stroke of the characters contained the shadow of a sword, as
though these were words formed from countless sword-shadows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword] technique. The complete [Three-Foot Sword] technique.”
Immortal Diancai’s eyes were shining, and a look of shock and
delight was in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sword
technique…that’s the legendary [Three-Foot Sword] technique!”
The short old man didn’t appear to be the slightest bit relaxed as
well, and his eyes were filled with shock, surprise, and ardor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At virtually the same
instant, three more figures suddenly appeared in the night sky. One
was an old man with a long beard, a crown on his head, and who had an
extraordinary bearing; when he strode forward, it was as though an
emperor was walking past, naturally capable of commanding a realm.
The second was a childish-looking boy who radiated an inexhaustible
frigid aura, and whose eyes appeared incomparably ancient. The third
was a tall, muscular man whose entire body was covered with chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them all
stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword] has once more revealed itself to the world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Black-White
College has recruited yet another incredible disciple.” The three
stared downwards towards Ning, their eyes filled with anticipation
and excitement. Immortal Diancai and the short elder also stared
downwards. The five of them didn’t say a single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, yet another
figure appeared in the air. This was a white-robed youth who was
incomparably handsome, almost devilishly so. The white-robed youth
appeared, then immediately said respectfully, “Greetings,
Uncle-Masters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t say a
thing.” The short elder immediately gestured at him. The
white-robed youth nodded. Although he had the exalted status of
headmaster of the Black-White College, in front of these five, he
still showed the respect due to seniors. He stood there obediently,
not saying anything further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Hand’ ‘Wield’
‘Three’ ‘Foot’ ‘Sword’ ‘Kill’…the characters formed
from sword-shadows hung there in the air, radiating light. But
suddenly, all of the glowing characters flew straight towards Ning’s
eyeballs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes. And
then, in the same istant, the glowing line of words atop the stone
wall suddenly dimmed, becoming ordinary looking and no longer
emanating any radiance or aura whatsoever. Perhaps, when the time was
right and when yet another disciple capable of receiving its
sword-intent transmission appeared, it would once more display its
extraordinariness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.” The
short old man laughed. “Senior Northwalker’s complete [Three-Foot
Sword] has been transmitted to this kid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The complete
[Three-Foot Sword].” The bearded, crowned elder sighed with emotion
as well. “How many years has it been? The last time the [Three-Foot
Sword] emerged was nearly thirty million years ago. Finally, yet
another disciple has inherited the complete [Three-Foot Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword]…it exterminated countless vile demons, and killed until the
heavens grew dim and the earth turned dark. It killed so many that
even the entire Grand Xia Dynasty was shocked, and it even
slaughtered a path out of our very world of existence.” The tall,
muscular man who was covered in those bizarre chains spoke in a low,
rumbling voice as well. His eyes were filled with eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all
Immortals, but the difference in their power was great. Immortal
Northwalker was at a level where he was no weaker than a Celestial
Immortal, and where even some Celestial Immortals would be afraid of
him. For someone like him…killing an ordinary Loose Immortal or
Earth Immortal was as easy as slaughtering a chicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was precisely why,
despite the passage of countless years, the Black-White College
continued to feel the utmost of veneration for Immortal Northwalker.
In fact, he was the only person in the entire history of the
Black-White College whose status was considered to be even higher
than that of the Celestial Immortal they had produced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword].” Immortal Diancai spoke very slowly. “According to the
legends, it has a total of nine stances; the first six stances are
recorded in the secret annals of our Black-White College, but the
final three stances…they were what Immortal Northwalker truly
relied on when he roamed the world and dominated it with
invincibility. They were impossible to record down through words and
pictures; the only way one can receive them is through the
profounder-than-profound Epochal Transmission.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This child has the
heart of a Sword Immortal.” The bearded elder stared downwards at
Ning. “In addition, his Dao-heart is incomparably firm and pure,
and his soul is very powerful. Only one who fulfills all three
criteria can receive a technique such as this [Three-Foot Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The juvenile-looking
boy nodded. “In each generation, our Black-White College has a good
number of disciples who have firm Dao-hearts and powerful souls, but
the heart of a Sword Immortal…this is too rare, too rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heart of a Sword
Immortal represents the true essence of a swordsman, that which stems
from the heart.” The short old man said with a sigh, “In
addition, being able to develop the heart of a Sword Immortal is a
prerequisite for embarking on one of the Grand Daos, the Dao of the
Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai, are you going to accept this excellent
disciple or not? If you won’t, I will,” the bearded elder said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The juvenile-looking
boy’s eyes were blazing. “Junior apprentice-brother Diancai, I’ll
take this disciple. Although he isn’t able to execute the
[Three-Foot Sword] right now, it has already been imprinted onto his
soul. Once he reaches the proper level, he’ll be able to execute
it. I am quite eager to have the chance to cultivate a Sword Immortal
who will be in possession of the [Three-Foot Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai…” All of them spoke out. But Immortal
Diancai just glanced out of the corner of his eyes at the four. “I
haven’t even taken a single disciple. Are you all going to fight
with me over him?” The other four all laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jadesea.” Immortal
Diancai looked towards the white-robed youth. “Uncle-master.” The
white-robed youth immediately nodded. Immortal Diancai chuckled, then
asked, “Who is that young fellow below us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
Daoist Jadesea, immediately responded, “He is one of the two
disciples which our Black-White College has just accepted. His name
is Ji Ning, and he comes from a minor tribe, the Ji clan, which lives
in the Swallow Mountain region of our Stillwater Commandery. His
parents are already deceased. Ever since he was young, he displayed
astonishing, unparalleled talents, and at the age of eleven, he
executed the Zifu Disciple, Bei Zishan, who was being pursued by the
Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then, because
Immortal Firedragon made a breakthrough in the territory of the Ji
clan and caused an elemental ore mine to appear, a local branch of
Snowdragon Mountain sought to annihilate the Ji clan, but the end
result was that Snowdragon Mountain lost a Wanxiang Adept and more
than twenty Zifu Disciples. The main reason why Snowdragon Mountain
suffered such a catastrophic loss was this Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, he
became friends with Northmont Baiwei, who is of the direct, primary
lineage of the Northmont clan. He engaged in a battle in the Carefree
Caverns, and during the battle revealed that he was already at the
level of comprehending a Dao Domain. He is currently sixteen years of
age. The other person who entered our Black-White College, Mu
Northson, is fourteen years of age.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Immortals,
upon hearing this information, all nodded. Ning’s growth rate was
monstrous and astonishing in the ears of others, but in the eyes of
these Immortals of the Black-White College, Ning’s growth rate was
just decent at best. After all, they had all even seen quite a few
reincarnated Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning shall
be my disciple.” Immortal Diancai glanced at the surrounding
individuals. “My four senior apprentice-brothers, please support me
in this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought you’d
never take on a disciple, junior apprentice-brother Diancai.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t fight with
you over him. You have gained the deepest level of insight regarding
the swordplay of senior Northwalker; if you don’t teach this boy,
who will? If I taught him, wouldn’t I hamper his progress?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, over the course
of this conversation amongst Immortals, Ning’s future master had
been determined, just like that.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_24___The_Grand_Admission"></A>
Chapter 24 - The Grand Admissions Ceremony
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was late at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only two
disciples of the Black-White College located in the plaza which held
the Black-White Diagram. Ji Ning slowly opened his eyes. Although it
was a late night in the twelfth lunar month, and it was extremely
cold, Ning’s heart was filled with a scorching heat. He stared at
the words left behind by Immortal Northwalker, hidden amongst the
countless words left behind on the stone wall, and his emotions
continued to fluctuate for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword is the
joyous sword, the sword of passion, the sword which exterminates all
injustices! It is better to live passionately for a day, than to live
a century while stifled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still remembered
with perfect clarity that vision of that silver-haired old figure,
who seemed to be as exalted as the heavens themselves. He clearly
remembered that heaven-surging sword-intent, clearly remembered that
sword technique. All of these things had been deeply engraved in his
heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What level of
swordcraft is this? Comparing my swordcraft to it would truly be like
comparing the light of a firefly to the brilliance of the full moon.”
Ning’s heart was surging with emotions, and his eyes were filled
with boundless admiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…Ning’s ear
twitched. He immediately turned, only to see a white-robed figure
walk over from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
startled. Today, the only two new students should have been himself
and Mu Northson. Aside from the two of them, who else would come here
in the dead of night?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
walked over from afar, and as he did, Ning felt as though endless,
boundless waves were slowly surging towards him in a crushing flow.
The entire world seemed to have transformed into waves…but when
they reached Ning, things grew clear once more. There were no waves
at all…just that white-robed youth walking towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying.”
Ning felt alarm in his heart. Although there was no oppressive,
dominating aura, the sense of danger which this white-robed youth had
given him wasn’t one whit inferior to that which Northmont
Blacktiger had given him. In addition, this white-robed youth was
handsome to the point of being devilish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clasped his hands
in a salute. “This junior, Ji Ning, pays his respects to you,
senior.” Before coming, Ning had already received an intelligence
report from Northmont Baiwei regarding the school. Based on the
information in that report, Ning already had an idea as to who this
person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist title is
‘Jadesea’,” the white-robed youth said. “I am fortunate
enough to hold the position of headmaster for now.” Ning responded
with respect, “Greetings, Headmaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The headmaster of the
Black-White College, ‘Daoist Jadesea’, was naturally a truly
influential and powerful figure within Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Headmaster, junior
apprentice-brother Northson is…” Ning looked towards Northson,
who was still absorbed in meditation in front of the Black-White
Diagram, seeming to be drunken or dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to disturb
him,” the headmaster, Daoist Jadesea, said while shaking his head.
“You are the one I’ve come to visit.” As he spoke, a scroll
appeared in front of Daoist Jadesea. He then extended his arm, even
more pure and jade-white than most women’s, and the scroll floated
towards Ning. Ning respectfully accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After reading it,
you will understand.” Daoist Jadesea looked towards Ning. “As the
Epochal Heir of Immortal Northwalker, you must not be indolent.
Remember. After finishing reading this scroll, destroy it.” After
speaking, Headmaster Daoist Jadesea turned and departed, quickly
disappearing from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there,
stunned. Epochal Heir? Could not be indolent? Ning immediately
unfurled the hide-bound scroll; this scroll was made from the hide of
an ordinary animal, but the words and information atop it instantly
drew Ning’s attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal
Northwalker?” A look of delight appeared on Ning’s face. He had
been wanting to learn more regarding this Immortal Northwalker. The
upper part of this hide-bound scroll described Immortal Northwalker’s
experiences as he grew in power, as well as some notable events he
had been involved in. Ning was completely engrossed and mesmerized by
the information within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a true legend.
The legend which the entire Black-White College held in the greatest
respect. “In acting, one should act as senior Northwalker did,”
Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When senior Northwalker
acted, he did so in a manner which could be described in two words;
‘straightforward’ and ‘passionate’! That was the only thing
he cared about, to the point where, when he saw the disciples of a
supreme clan acting in sinful, wicked ways, he annihilated them all
in his anger and even destroyed their souls. This resulted in him
being pursued and attacked by this supreme clan, a pursuit which
lasted for centuries. Immortal Northwalker had even been forced to
flee from this major world, but over the course of this pursuit, he
had grown more and more powerful. Afterwards, when he had returned,
many of the powerful experts of that supreme clan were killed or
injured, and in the end, they had been forced to lower their heads
and admit defeat, paying reparations and reconciling themselves to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
supreme clan it was,” Ning mused to himself. “This scroll didn’t
record their name; clearly, they don’t want for this matter to
become public. Most likely, this was part of the reconciliation
process that occurred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given what a massive
battle this had been, clearly, that supreme clan was truly incredible
as well. At the same time, it also demonstrated how straightforward
and passionate Immortal Northwalker’s actions were. He truly did
act to exterminate all injustice!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle of the
scroll recorded a dialogue. A junior disciple posed a query to
Immortal Northwalker: “Countless vile actions were being carried
out in this vast world; if one always went to exterminate evildoers,
how could one possibly ever kill them all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Northwalker
had responded thusly: “The number of sins and wicked deeds carried
out in this vast world are numerous beyond count, and I can’t be
bothered to take charge of all matters in this world. Any injustices
that I personally encounter, however, I will naturally exterminate,
and so return joy and passion to myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His meaning was simple
and clear. If he didn’t personally encounter injustice, he couldn’t
be bothered with it. But if he did? That would ruin his mood…and he
would exterminate it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly did live a
carefree live, where he did as he pleased.” Ning felt admiration
for the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reading through
the records of Immortal Northwalker, Ning turned to the bottom part
of the scroll, which began to introduce the [Three-Foot Sword]. The
[Three-Foot Sword] had a total of nine stances, and was the supreme
technique which Immortal Northwalker had used to stun the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty. It was the distilled essence of his million-plus
years of experience, and it was so powerful that even Immortal
Northwalker himself was unable to completely record down this
technique in a manuscript for transmission to later descendants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Repository
Vault of the Black-White College only held the first six stances of
the [Three-Foot Sword]. To this very day, no one was capable of
recording down the final three stances in written form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, those words
left behind on the stone wall had been personally penned by Immortal
Northwalker. Only when there was a sword-intent resonance would an
Epochal Transmission occur, and could the [Three-Foot Sword] be
transmitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
works. Occasionally, a later disciple of the Black-White College will
receive an Epochal Transmission, but even if they do, it’s quite
rare for them to obtain the complete sword technique. The last time a
complete sword technique was transmitted was more than thirty million
years ago.” Upon reading this, Ning finally understood how
astonishing a gain he had just reaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning also now
understood why Headmaster Daoist Jadesea had given him this scroll.
It was precisely because of how important the [Three-Foot Sword] was;
if some of the enemy powers were to learn that the Black-White
College had produced yet another genius who had gained the complete
legacy of the [Three-Foot Sword], they would probably use any means
at their disposal to ensure that this genius would fall early on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, this news
absolutely could not be publicized. But of course, he could still use
the [Three-Foot Sword]; after all, the Dao Repository Vault had the
secret manuals for the first six stances of the [Three-Foot Sword].
As for using the seventh stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], if the
situation called for it…then there was no need to keep the secret
any longer. Once one possessed the power of the seventh stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword], then one would already be standing at a peak of
power. After all, the seventh stance was already something which even
Immortal Northwalker was unable to commit to paper; from this, one
could imagine how powerful it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two more hours passed.
Only now did Northson completely come to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
absolutely wonderful.” Northson’s eyes were blazing as he turned
to look at the nearby Ning. He immediately called out in excitement,
“Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, this Black-White Diagram is
simply too helpful in training. I feel as though I have made
tremendous, tremendous progress in the Dao of Constructs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But immediately
afterwards, Northson realized something; Ning had awoken before he
did. Most likely, he hadn’t gained as much from the Black-White
Diagram as Northson himself did. This made Northson feel rather
embarrassed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed, I’ve
gained much,” Ning said with a laugh. “It’s late. I imagine
that it will be dawn soon. Junior apprentice-brother Northson, it’s
time to get some rest. Two days later, we’ll go to the Headmaster’s
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also,” Ning
warned, “These words left behind by Immortals all have quite a
history and are worthy of you viewing.” Northson walked the Dao of
Constructs; naturally, he wouldn’t have the heart of a Sword
Immortal and wouldn’t be able to receive the legacy of the Immortal
Northwalker. However, although Ning had received the Epochal
Transmission of Immortal Northwalker, it could very well be that
there were other legacies left behind by other ancestors of the
school on the stone wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It’s almost
dawn. I’ll come here in the future and read through them slowly,”
Northson said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! The two
left, one on a wooden boat, the other on an Azure Dragon construct.
They each headed towards their own abodes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
two days passed. As had been predicted, on the second and third days,
there were no applicants who were qualified to become formal
disciples of the Black-White College! Thus, this year, the only new
disciples of the Black-White College were Ji Ning and Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson were
streaking through the air above the Black-White College like two
streaks of light, moving directly towards the Headmaster’s Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Northson’s eyes were filled with
eagerness. “Today, we will receive black-white pellets. We’ll be
able to enter the Dao Repository Vault and exchange it for Ki
Refining techniques or secret Immortal techniques. In addition…we
will be paying our respects to our masters. We don’t even know who
they will be yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I wonder who
will be my master,” Ning mused in a soft voice. Master. For an
Immortal practitioner to acknowledge a master was completely
different from how he had acknowledged Blindfish to be his master
when learning archery as a child. Archery was just the technique of
an ordinary mortal, but your master on the Immortal path…what they
passed down to you would help you on your road to becoming an
Immortal. The value of this benevolence shown was far greater, and
most likely the relationship between a master and apprentice would
persist for centuries or even millennia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Ning
and Northson landed in front of the Headmaster’s Hall. Quite a few
formal disciples had already gathered together within the
Headmaster’s Hall, at least a hundred or more. They were casually
chatting amongst themselves, and all of them had extraordinary
demeanors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning and Northson
entered the palace, quite a few of the formal disciples turned to
glance at them. Most of them had kind looks in their eyes, and they
nodded slightly, signifying greetings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems only part
of the formal disciples of the Black-White College have come,” Ning
mused to himself. “It makes sense. Immortal practitioners can’t
always be staying within the school; I imagine many are outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each year, there would
be a grand ceremony for admitting new disciples. But sometimes
Immortal practitioners would enter closed-door meditation for
decades; thus, attendance at this sort of ceremony was not too
important. Those who could come would; if one couldn’t, it didn’t
matter much. Still…for most, as long as they weren’t engaged in
any pressing matters within the school, they would still come and pay
their respects at the Headmaster’s Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Headmaster is
coming,” someone suddenly called out. Ning and the others
immediately turned to look. A white-robed youth was descending from
midair, and there were multiple figures behind him. All of them were
Primal Daoists of the Black-White College; this entire group of
Primal Daoists descended en masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
normal customs of the Black-White College, new disciples of the
College will generally take on Primal Daoists as masters,” Ning
mused to himself. The Primal Daoists of the Black-White College were
not like those of ordinary schools; some of them had such astonishing
power that they were comparable to ordinary Immortals. Thus, being
able to become a disciple of a Primal Daoist of the Black-White
College was quite a fortunate affair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which one
of them will be my master?” Ning swept his gaze past all of the
Primal Daoists, including the headmaster, Daoist Jadesea. He began to
privately guess at which of them it would be.
</P>

Chapter 25 - Daoist Title, Darknorth
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jadesea sat on
high in the headmaster’s seat, staring downwards towards the Primal
Daoists, who had lined up into two rows. Beneath the palace was a
group of Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Black-White
College, the various disciples were primarily divided into three
generations of status. The Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang Adepts were
considered to be of the same generation of status, and could refer to
each other as junior or senior fellow disciples. This was because it
was extremely easy for any of these Zifu Disciples to reach the
Wanxiang Adept level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal Daoists were on
a higher level. Immortals, in turn, had the highest status. Generally
speaking, when disciples like Ji Ning met with an Immortal, they
would address them as ‘Patriarch’, while when they met with a
Primal Daoist, they would address them as ‘Uncle-Master’. But of
course, if one was able to take on an Immortal as one’s master,
they would naturally refer to that Immortal as ‘Master’. Still,
in addressing other Immortals, one would still use the term
‘Patriarch’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
status amongst Immortal practitioners was determined by strength and
power, and they each befriended people on the same level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone,” Daoist
Jadesea said, seated atop his high chair, his voice echoing
throughout the hall. “Our Black-White College has taken on two new
disciples. The skinny, fur-clad one on the left is Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gaped. Skinny?
Well, it made sense; it wouldn’t be appropriate to refer to him as
the ‘youth’ either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The one on the
right, the even skinnier one who is dressed in white robes, is named
Mu Northson,” Daoist Jadesea said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson blinked as
well. Even skinnier?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus
disciples within the palace all began to laugh, and looks of
amusement had appeared on the faces of the Primal Daoists as well.
Clearly, they all knew what sort of a character their headmaster,
Daoist Jadesea, was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jadesea grinned
as he looked towards Ning and Northson as well. “The people present
within this palace today consist of a portion of the disciples of our
Black-White College. Many are either in closed-door meditation or
wandering the world. In the future, you will meet them all. From
today onwards, you are all members of the Black-White College. We
must be of one mind and one heart; it is forbidden for members of the
college to engage in fratricide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
and Northson both immediately acknowledged these words. Daoist
Jadesea continued, “Mm. Then let us begin the Oath of Blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson
glanced at each other. They immediately stretched out one finger from
their right hands, and a drop of fresh blood emerged from their
fingers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let our heart’s
blood bear testament, and let the Dao of the Heavens stand witness.
I, Ji Ning (Mu Northson), willingly and freely join the Black-White
College. As disciples of the Black-White College, I shall obey the
rules of the Black-White College…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A nameless, ancient
aura began to circulate throughout the hall. Nobody else said a word;
the only ones speaking were Ning and Northson, and their voices
echoed within the grand palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Oath of Blood, sworn
to the Dao of the Heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a mighty oath
that absolutely could not be foresworn. This was also the reason why
it was extremely rare for someone to betray their school in the Grand
Xia Dynasty. If one did betray one’s school, even before the school
came to punish them, the punishment of the Dao of Heaven would have
already slain the traitor. But of course, if the school had wronged
the disciple, or if it had expelled the disciple, then it would no
longer be the disciple’s fault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since every single
disciple was willing to swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens, it
was still quite fair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After hearing the
swearing of the Oath of Blood to the Dao of the Heavens, Daoist
Jadesea nodded in satisfaction. “Excellent. You have now formally
joined our school. Since you have joined us, you need to choose your
Daoist titles. Each of you can choose a title you like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson both
began to ponder this. A Daoist title…for example, Daoist Jadesea’s
Daoist title was ‘Jadesea’, and Immortal Firedragon’s Daoist
title was ‘Firedragon’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t wish
to choose a Daoist title, you can use your own given name as your
Daoist title,” Daoist Jadesea said with a laugh. “There are some
disciples who are accustomed to using their own names and
unaccustomed to Daoist titles. There are thus quite a few who use
their own names.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist title
shall be ‘Twinwood’,” Northson suddenly said. Daoist Jadesea
nodded lightly. “Twinwood? Very well.” He looked towards the
nearby Ning next. “Ji Ning, what about you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said slowly, “My
Daoist title…let it be Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Daoist
Jadesea nodded. “Since your Daoist titles have been chosen, let the
elders of our Black-White College discuss amongst themselves who will
take you as their student. If you aren’t willing, you can speak out
at this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
and Northson both said. Unwilling? What sort of a joke was this? As
long as there was no enmity between them, generally speaking, as long
as an elder was willing to be their master, the disciple would not
refuse to be their student.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson.”
Suddenly, from amidst the crowd of Primal Daoists near Daoist
Jadesea, a white-haired, baby-faced old lady suddenly spoke out. She
looked at Northson, a hint of benevolent love in her eyes. “I heard
that you walk the Dao of Constructs. I, Jadefine, have also gained
quite a few insights into the Dao of Constructs. I wonder if you
would be willing to accept me as your master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart thumped.
Jadefine? According to the intelligence report which Northmont Baiwei
had provided him, Daoist Jadefine had the highest degree of
understanding of the Dao of Constructs in the entire Black-White
College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple is
willing.” Northson respectfully fell to his knees. “Your disciple
pays his respects to you, Master.” Daoist Jadefine smiled, then
nodded. “Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
the various Primal Daoists up ahead. Which one of them would become
his master? Which one? But Daoist Jadesea and the other Primal
Daoists didn’t say a single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm. Strange. Why
aren’t any of them accepting junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning as
their disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. None of our
uncle-masters are saying a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other disciples
were secretly chatting amongst themselves. But Daoist Jadesea, seated
above them, suddenly turned to stare towards the outside of the
palace. A figure had appeared within the doorway to the palace; a
black-haired, black-robed man was walking in. His gaze was both
stately and fierce, and as soon as he stepped into the palace, it was
as though the entire palace had been steeped into darkness. All of
the disciples turned to stare at this man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects to you,
Patriarch.” Many of the disciples quickly spoke out. A few of the
others were a bit lost; clearly, they didn’t recognize this man.
Still, they hurriedly imitated the other disciples in bowing
respectfully. As for Ning and Northson, they followed the crowd in
bowing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects to you,
Uncle-Master.” The Primal Daoists in front all called out
respectfully as well. “Uncle-Master.” Daoist Jadesea rose as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired man’s figure had instantly become the center for the
entire palace. It was as though the entire world was revolving around
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
black-robed, black-haired man looked towards Ning. “Are you willing
to become the senior disciple under my tutelage?” Ning was shocked.
As soon as this man had spoken, Ning had immediately realized who he
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The intelligence report
Baiwei had provided had very little information on the various
Immortals in the palace, with just a few lines of information for
each; after all, the information on the Immortals was very highly
classified, while the report Baiwei had provided him consisted of
fairly open secrets. Thus, there was just a very simple introduction
regarding Immortal Diancai..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai: An
Earth Immortal of the Black-White College. Highly specialized in
swordplay. No disciples to his name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the living Immortals
of the Black-White College, Immortal Diancai was the only one who had
never accepted any disciples. Upon hearing the words, ‘senior
disciple under my tutelage’, Ning immediately understood who the
person before him was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t
apprentice himself to this man, then who?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple is
willing.” Ning fell to his knees, respectfully kowtowing in a
ritual manner. “Your disciple, Ji Ning, pays his respect to you,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Folllow me.” A
rare hint of a smile was on Immortal Diancai’s stern face. Nodding
to the others and saying a few words, he immediately left the hall,
and Ning hurriedly followed after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
disciples in the hall, they all stared in astonishment. An Immortal
had taken a direct disciple? This was extremely rare. Only the most
monstrously talented of their generation had been accepted by one of
the Immortals as a disciple, and all of these monsters were rumored
to actually be reincarnated Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clouds swirled
about Immortal Diancai and Ning as they flew at high speed towards an
estate. They entered the estate, then into the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai sat
down atop his jade bed. As for Ning, he stood there to one side,
incomparably respectful. He could tell that Immortal Diancai was
normally quite a stern, taciturn person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my entire life,
the person I hold the most admiration for is senior Northwalker,”
Immortal Diancai said. “I once swore that I would not accept any
disciple who did not receive the sword-intent transmission from
senior Northwalker. As for you, not only did you receive his
sword-intent transmission, you even inherited his legacy, the
complete [Three-Foot Sword]. Even I don’t know anything at all
regarding the final three stances of this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just listened
respectfully. Given that even the headmaster knew about this matter,
for his own master to know of this was only natural.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only ones who
know that you inherited the complete legacy of the [Three-Foot Sword]
are myself, Jadesea, and the other Immortals,” Immortal Diancai
said. “Thus, you cannot reveal it either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
“Your disciple understands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai looked
towards Ji Ning. “You should know that in our Black-White College,
if you wish to gain a top-tier Ki Refining technique or top-tier
divine ability, you have to use black-white pellets to trade for
them.” Ning nodded. The black-and-white book he had read earlier
had described these things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one wished to
acquire the divine ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’, one needed
a certain number of black-white pellets. If one wanted to gain a
certain Ki Refining technique, one would also need a certain number
of black-white pellets. If one wished to acquire a technique for
their spirit-beast, one would still need to use black-white pellets
to trade for it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black-white pellets
were rewarded to disciples by the school. For example, if one reached
the Dao Domain level, one would be rewarded with black-white pellets.
If one became a Wanxiang Adept, one would also be rewarded with
black-white pellets. Upon becoming a Primal Daoist, one would receive
still further black-white pellets. If one joined the Raindragon
Guard, one would be bestowed black-white pellets…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, the better
one’s performance was, the more black-white pellets the school
would bestow. Naturally, this would allow one to gain access to ever
more profound techniques owned by the school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has your soul
reached the ‘divine sense’ level?” Immortal Diancai asked. Ning
couldn’t help but feel shocked; he had never revealed this before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Receiving the
complete [Three-Foot Sword] legacy places enormous strains on the
soul. In the past, virtually every single person who ever acquired
the complete [Three-Foot Sword] legacy was a reincarnated Immortal
whose soul was at least at the ‘divine sense’ level,” Immortal
Diancai explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
“Your disciple’s soul has indeed reached the ‘divine sense’
level, but as for being a reincarnated Immortal…it seems your
disciple…’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After having drank
Granny Meng’s Elixir, you naturally will have forgotten the
memories from your previous life.” Immortal Diancai shook his head.
“However, given how powerful your soul is, even if you aren’t a
reincarnated Immortal, you must have encountered a tremendously great
karmic event.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai fell
silent for a moment, then started to muse to himself. “You’ve
just entered the school, so you can receive the basic reward of a
thousand black-white pellets. You have reached the Dao Domain realm,
so you can be rewarded with another thousand black-white pellets.
Your soul is at the divine sense level, and so you can be awarded two
thousand black-white pellets. As your master, I can bestow you with
another two thousand black-white pellets. Thus, you have a total of
six thousand black-white pellets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai said
seriously, “Since you have already received the complete legacy of
the [Three-Foot Sword], in the future, you will definitely be forced
to use it. Thus, when you go to the Dao Repository Vault, you must
trade for the first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword]. The [Three-Foot
Sword] is the swordplay which has secured the foundations of our
Black-White College; thus, even the first scroll will cost you two
thousand black-white pellets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. He
clearly had inherited the entire legacy of the [Three-Foot Sword],
but in order to hide it, he would actually have to go trade for the
first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword]? And the price was two
thousand black-white pellets! So this was the reason why his master
had bestowed him two thousand black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for your Ki
Refining technique…remember, you absolutely must select a Ki
Refining technique that you can use to train all the way to the
Immortal level,” Immortal Diancai said. “As for divine abilities
and sword techniques…choose as you see fit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go now. Go
directly to the Dao Repository Vault and withdraw your black-white
pellets and your liquefied elemental essence. Afterwards, go choose
your Ki Refining techniques, sword techniques, divine abilities, and
what-not.” Immortal Diancai concluded, “If there is something you
cannot comprehend, come ask me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning bowed
with respect. And then, he departed, heading directly to the Dao
Repository Vault.

Chapter 26 - Within the Dao Repository Vault
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morning sun rose,
and the light of the dawn shone upon the entire Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ji Ning,
mounted atop his flying boat, was soaring through the skies. Soon, he
saw a majestic, towering vault beneath him. This was the edifice
which, within the Black-White College, had a status that was not
inferior to the Black-White Diagram’s; the Dao Repository Vault!
Whenever the disciples of the Black-White College wished to learn
top-tier Ki Refining techniques, divine abilities, or secret arts,
they would come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large, muscular man,
dressed in a beautiful set of armor, was currently seated next to a
stone table, holding an exquisite goblet of wine and enjoying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed on the
ground. “My respects to you, Uncle-Master,” Ning said with a bow.
“Oh?” The large, muscular man glanced sideways at Ning. “You
are the new disciple, Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said.
This large, muscular man was one of the Dao-Protectors of the Vault,
a position generally given to Primal Daoists. “Here are six
thousand black-white pellets.” The large, muscular man waved his
hand, and a black jade bottle flew out towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it and
filled it with his elemental ki. Within this jade bottle, there
really was a veritable mass of pellets, all of which were black and
white in color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are fifty
kilograms of liqueified elemental essence. For disciples of the third
generation, every ten years, they will receive this amount of
liquefied elemental essence.” The large, muscular man tossed
another jade bottle to Ning. “Alright. You’ve collected your
black-white pellets and your liquefied elemental essence. You can go
in now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two bottles; one a dark
jade color, the other an emerald jade color. They were used to store
six thousand black-white pellets and fifty kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence, respectively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College lives up to its reputation,” Ning said to himself with a
sigh. “Someone like me, a third generation disciple, will receive
fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence each decade. Doesn’t
that mean that every century, I will receive five hundred kilograms?
An ordinary Earth-ranked magic treasure is only worth around a
hundred taels of liquefied elemental essence, while most
Heaven-ranked magic treasures are worth just ten thousand taels or
so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five hundred
kilograms of liqueified elemental essence which disciples of the
Black-White College received each century were already enough to
trade for a Heaven-ranked magic treasure. But of course, no one would
be so stupid as to save them all up; this liquefied elemental essence
was meant to help them rise in power by allowing them to not need to
waste a great amount of time in slowly absorbing energy from nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Uncle-Master.” Ning immediately strode into the Dao Repository
Vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
three levels to the Dao Repository Vault. As soon as Ning entered the
first level, he felt as though he had entered a sea of books. One
enormous book shelf after another could be seen, with countless
numbers of books placed on them. At first glance…Ning dared to
guess that there had to be more than a million books here, and the
vast majority of the books which lined the largest walls and shelves
had a single large character on the sides: ‘Technique’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Techniques!” Ning
mused to himself, “The Dao Repository Vault has three levels. The
first level focuses on techniques, the second on arts, and the third
on miscellaneous things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The word technique, in
this case, referred to refining techniques, such as Ki Refining and
Fiendgod Body Refining techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The word arts referred
to secret magic arts used by Immortals and Fiends. They included
ingenious ways of using power, and included the ‘divine abilities’
of Fiendgods, the ‘sword arts’ of Sword Immortals, the ‘forbidden
techniques’ which one could use in a crisis, the ‘evasion arts’
one could use when fleeing…all techniques which relied on special
tricks and applications of power were classified as skills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for miscellaneous,
they consisted of things that were not classified with the first two.
Constructs, formations, venomous pests, refining magic treasure,
refining magic pills, poisons…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master said that I
absolutely must trade for the first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword],
as well as a Ki Refining technique that can be used all the way up to
the Immortal level.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately
beginning to search through the first level of the Dao Repository
Vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refining techniques
were divided into Immortal-rank, Heaven-rank, Earth-rank,
Mortal-rank, and so on. Immortal-rank…this meant that this was a Ki
Refining technique that could be used to train all the way up to the
Celestial Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the way up to
Celestial Immortal?” Ning sighed with emotion. “Although
supposedly one can use Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques to
train all the way up to the Celestial Immortal level, even the
Black-White College has only produced a single Celestial Immortal in
its entire history. Even Immortal Northwalker and those other
outstandingly talented figures were unable to become Celestial
Immortals. The path to becoming a Celestial Immortal is indeed as
difficult as Judge Cui described; the tribulations one must face are
boundless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
search carefully. Soon he found, deep in the depths of the Dao
Repository Vault, a black, wooden table. Atop it, there were a total
of twenty nine golden books arranged in a row. This table had a
single character carved on its side - Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal-ranked Ki
Refining techniques?” Ning hurriedly picked up a golden book. This
book was named [Samgha Sutra of Ascending to Heaven]. This was just a
simple, abridged tone; after all, an Immortal-ranked Ki Refining
technique was definitely one of the most important,
foundation-establishing texts for a school. It absolutely would not
be permitted for it to be leaked to the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This first scroll of
the [Samgha Sutra of Ascending to Heaven] actually costs 1500
black-white pellets.” Ning was secretly speechless. Turning his
head, he saw that atop the tall bookshelves, there were rows on rows
of Earth-ranked Ki Refining techniques, and all of them were complete
copies, not abridged ones…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are so cheap,
just a hundred black-white pellets,” Ning mumbled to himself.
Suddenly, a voice rang out by his side. “Senior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look. He
saw, from afar, a white-robed youth who had just arrived; his junior
apprentice-brother, Mu Northson. Northson was clearly quite excited.
“Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, there really are very many Ki
Refining techniques here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The school has
existed for so long. How can it not have many techniques?” Ning
replied. And then, the pair of fellow disciples began to once more
earnestly search for their own Ki Refining techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll choose this.”
Ning picked up a golden book; it was the Immortal-ranked Ki Refining
technique, the [Flowing Watersource]. The first volume could be
purchased for 1500 black-white pellets. The Ki Refining technique
which Ning had trained in since he was a child was the [Water Element
Art]; after having established his Zifu, of the Five Elements, he was
naturally most suited to water-attribute techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When adding the cost
of the first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword], which I have to
acquire, I need to pay 3500 black-white pellets. I have another 2500
black-white pellets I can use.” Ning began to ponder to himself. He
needed to acquire a technique for Uncle White. He also needed to
acquire a divine ability. He also needed the later parts of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White is at
the early Zifu stage; he is in urgent need of a Ki Refining
technique. In addition, of the Five Elements, he too is most suited
to water. This [Flowing Watersource] is very suited to him as well.”
Ning continued to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had just
chosen a single copy of the [Flowing Watersource], if he wanted to
let Uncle White train in it as well, then he would have to pay
another 1500 black-white pellets! If he didn’t…then that would
mean that they had stolen the technique, and an Immortal-ranked
technique at that. This was a tremendously grave crime, and the Oath
of Blood he had sworn to the Dao of the Heavens, by itself, would
deliver a punishment that would probably shatter Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a thousand
more black-white pellets remaining.” Ning instantly felt as though
he didn’t have enough black-white pellets to spend. But what he
didn’t realize was, no one else would be willing to spend such a
fortune on a spirit-beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later,
within the first level of the Dao Repository Vault, Ning was able to
find the books focusing on Fiendgod Body Refining. He also found the
later scrolls introducing the number one Fiendgod Body Refining
technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; the
so-called ‘second scroll’ to the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second scroll of
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] also had nine stages
to it. It consisted of the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth…all the
way to the eighteenth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These levels
corresponded to the Wanxiang Adept, Primal Daoist, and Void stages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the
eighteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
one would undergo a tribulation. If one successfully endured that
heavenly tribulation, one would become an Empyrean God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ki Refiners,
once they overcame their tribulation, they would become Celestial
Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals…these were two different branches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred
black-white pellets? So cheap.” Ning, upon seeing the price,
couldn’t help but sigh in relief. “Although it will let you train
all the way to the heavenly tribulation, it only costs a hundred
black-white pellets. It really is the most easily acquired
technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the number one
Fiendgod Body Refining technique. It was also the most easily
acquired technique. And, in turn, it was the most difficult technique
to learn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a copy of the
[Flowing Watersource] and a copy of the second scroll of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], then left the first
level of the Dao Repository Vault and went to the second level. The
second level was also filled with countless bookshelves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arts!” Ning took a
deep breath. These were the secret arts of Immortals and Fiends. They
represented ways in which one could apply the Dao, divine abilities,
sword arts, spells, forbidden techniques, evasion techniques, and
more. All of these were classified as ‘arts’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine abilities.”
The first thing Ning did was to head to the bookshelves which held
the records on divine abilities. Divine abilities…these were
extremely rare. Even his mother’s Yuchi clan had only been in
possession of a single divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion]
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So few. So
expensive!” Ning finally found the shelf which contained the divine
abilities, but the entire shelf only had five abridged books. In
other words, despite the passage of countless years, the entire
Black-White College was only in possession of five divine abilities!
They were even more rare than Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five techniques
were the [Heavenly Transformation], [Divine Thunderbolt Eye], [Myriad
Hibernating Venoms], [Three Heads, Six Arms], and [Eye of the
Luminous Heart].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Three Heads, Six
Arms]?” Ning’s eyes instantly lit up. The [Heavenly
Transformation] technique was the most common divine ability;
generally speaking, all top-tier schools and sects had it. As for the
other three divine abilities, [Divine Thunderbolt Eye], [Eye of the
Luminous Heart], and [Myriad Hibernating Venoms], these were divine
abilities which, according to rumor, some major powers would often
use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Three Heads, Six
Arms]; it seems to be ordinary in effectiveness, but in reality, once
one reaches the late stages of this divine ability, it grows
tremendously powerful,” Ning mused to himself. Humans only had two
arms; even though, by relying on their divine power or elemental Ki,
they could coalesce additional arms, these arms couldn’t possibly
compare to true arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the [Three Heads,
Six Arms] technique…once this divine ability was executed, one
truly would gain four additional arms and two additional heads. The
power of these four additional arms was comparable to that of one’s
true arms; it would be as though three Ji Nings were linking hands
against a single foe! It must be understood that just by wielding
twin swords, one’s power would increase multiplicatively; with six
swords joining together in an attack, the power would reach a truly
ridiculous level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five divine abilities.
After seeing them, a look of lust was in Ning’s eyes. [Three Heads,
Six Arms] was extremely famous; naturally, there was a reason for
that. And thus, the price of the first scroll alone was three
thousand black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heavenly
Transformation] technique was the most commonly seen technique, but
when trained to the later stages, it was also capable of unleashing
astonishing levels of power. Its first scroll cost five hundred
black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Myriad Hibernating
Venoms] was also a true killer technique; the first scroll to this
divine ability cost five thousand black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first scroll of the
[Divine Thunderbolt Eye] cost two thousand black-white pellets as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the [Eye of the
Luminous Heart], the first scroll cost five thousand black-white
pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is too…”
Ning had to grit his teeth and pick up the abridged version of the
[Heavenly Transformations] technique. As for the other four divine
abilities, there was no way for him to acquire them at all. The cost
of these techniques was vastly greater than the cost of those
Immortal-ranked Ki Refiner techniques. But it was only reasonable;
these were divine abilities, incomparably precious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, those books in
hand, continued forward through the second level in search of even
more unusual ‘arts’. After searching for a long time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Found it.” Ning
finally found, atop a bookshelf, three golden books. The entire shelf
only had these three golden books atop it; apparently, the value of
these books wasn’t at all inferior to those divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately picked
up one of the golden books. Atop the cover, there were three words:
“Soul” “Shaker” “Art”. [Soulshaker Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was precisely what
Ning was searching for; an art which would allow him to use his soul
to engage in an attack. This was an extremely rare type of art.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_27___Training_in_the_Sti"></A>
Chapter 27 - Training in the Still Room
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Soulshaker Art]
was something only a person with a divine will could use; it could be
used to shake the opponent’s very soul. If the enemy’s soul was
particularly weak, it might even cause their soul to be extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is it.” Ning
nodded. “Previously, during the recruitment, Uncle-Master Wu Xiu
used the [Soulshaker Art] to cause hundreds of Zifu Disciples to all
fall down from midair. Something only capable of being used at the
‘divine will’ level? I’ve already reached the ‘divine sense’
level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to read
carefully. It really was alluring. Given the power of his soul, once
he used the [Soulshaker Art], he would be able to deal with the vast
majority of Wanxiang Adepts! After all, it was virtually guaranteed
that only Primal Daoists would have souls at the divine sense level!
Ning’s soul was so very powerful that if he were to use the
[Soulshaker Art], he would naturally be able to dominate the vast
majority of Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two thousand
black-white pellets?” When Ning saw the price of this art, he
immediately shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
three books on this shelf. One was the [Soulshaker Art], one was the
[Soulcharmer Art], while the other was the [Soulslayer Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the three, the
[Soulshaker Art] and the [Soulcharmer Art] only required someone’s
soul to be at the divine will level in order to learn them. The
prices for them were two thousand and three thousand black-white
pellets, respectively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the [Soulslayer
Art], this was truly used to extinguish an opponent’s soul, an art
used for divine souls to engage in battle. In addition, it required a
person to be at the divine sense level to learn it…and in terms of
rarity, it was even rarer than divine abilities! To trade for it, one
would need ten thousand black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I can do is
stare at it and drool.” Ning laughed, then shook his head. He
immediately turned to go look at the other arts available.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Repository
Vault was divided into techniques, arts, and miscellaneous. Virtually
all of the skills available were extremely powerful or particular
sinister. There were also all manner of brilliant sword arts as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had, in total,
just six thousand black-white pellets. Which should he purchase?
Which shouldn’t he purchase? He had to gain a clearer
understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six full hours later,
Ning finally departed from the third floor of the Dao Repository
Vault, then walked out of the vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve chosen?”
The tall, muscular Dao-Protector gave Ning a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, but he couldn’t help but turn to look backwards. It really
was…really was…he really wished he had a few hundred thousand
black-white pellets and was able to pick from those skills as he
pleased. There were all sorts of Immortal and Fiend techniques that
were simply too mysterious and godlike, as well as some truly
powerful evasive techniques that made Ning truly tongue-tied. Only
now did he truly understand how deep the roots of the Black-White
College were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, he only
had six thousand black-white pellets, and he absolutely had to choose
the first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword], as well as an
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look,”
the Dao-Protector said. Ning handed over the abridged books in his
hands. The Dao-Protector, after accepting them, immediately saw that
on top was the first scroll of the [Three-Foot Sword]. He immediately
said with a frown, “The [Three-Foot Sword] is one of the techniques
which secured the legacy of our Black-White College, and its power is
absolutely astonishing. But to comprehend it…will be extremely,
,extremely hard. It is a bit too early for you to start training in
the [Three-Foot Sword]; in addition, it will cost you two thousand
black-white pellets to trade for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt helpless. He
didn’t want to choose it this early either, but his master,
Immortal Diancai, had ordered him to do so. He had no one to blame
but himself for having received the legacy of senior Northwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Lesser Five
Elements Sword]?” The Dao-Protector, upon seeing the second book,
immediately nodded. “The [Lesser Five Elements Sword] is also one
of the top five sword techniques of our Black-White College, and it
is unfathomably deep and profound, allowing one to start at a basic
level but progressively comprehend more. It is very suitable for
someone who wishes to focus on the Dao of the sword, and it costs
eight hundred black-white pellets as well. Actually, I recommend that
you only trade for the [Lesser Five Elements Sword], and temporarily
set aside the [Three-Foot Sword] for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Flowing
Watersource]. An Immortal-ranked Ki Refining technique. Not bad.”
The Dao-Protector nodded, then raised his head and looked towards
Ning. “You made up your mind? These are all you want? You won’t
change your mind?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will not.” Ning
shook his head. There were many arts that were quite enticing to him,
but Ning had given them up. He had even given up acquiring the second
scroll of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. After all,
training in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] required
one to absorb the energy of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star…Ning
was currently only at the seventh level. To reach the ninth level, he
would still need a long period of time. During this period of time,
he would probably be able to acquire more black-white pellets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I’m not
able to acquire the second scroll of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens] in the Black-White College, I can join the
Raindragon Guard and acquire it there, or even purchase it from other
places,” Ning mused to himself. The second scroll of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was fairly easily
obtained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those various
sword arts…Ning had spent a long period of time analyzing them in
the Dao Repository Vault. Given that his divine ability, the
[Starseizing Hand], was with him, so long as his swordplay was strong
enough, his own power would naturally rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For fleeing, he had the
[Windwing Evasion]. In a true battle of divine abilities, he already
had the [Starseizing Hand], and so wasn’t in a rush to obtain other
divine abilities. What truly mattered was his Ki Refining technique
and his sword arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Lesser Five
Elements Sword] was the most suitable technique for him, because he
had a deep level of insight into three of the elements already;
water, wind, and fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2000 black-white
pellets for this, 1500 for this, and 800 for this. The three come to
a total of 4300 black-white pellets.” The Dao-Protector looked at
Ning. “Give me the black-white pellets, and I’ll go get the
copies for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Not only am I going to train in the [Flowing Watersource], I am
going to give my spirit-beast a copy as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your spirit-beast?”
The Dao-Protector was shocked. “You are going to give your
spirit-beast such a good Ki Refining technique? That costs 1500
black-white pellets. Moreover, you have just started training; this
is a critical moment for you. With 1500 black-white pellets, you can
purchase many powerful secret arts to protect yourself. There’s
absolutely no need for you to spend so much effort on your
spirit-beast. Just have him wait a bit longer; in a few decades or in
a century, purchase it for him then. Or, just give him a slightly
weaker Ki Refining technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As this Dao-Protector
saw it…Ning was a formal disciple and a truly monstrous talent. For
him to give a spirit-beast such a great benefit was a rash,
hot-headed act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal-ranked Ki
Refining techniques! Something like this could only happen within the
Black-White College. If they were roaming in the outside world, even
if a Zifu level monster risked his life for centuries, he would still
find it virtually impossible to acquire an Immortal-ranked Ki
Refining technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mind is decided,”
Ning said. The Dao-Protector shook his head. “Alas. Why must you be
such a fool?” Ning did not respond, but his gaze told the
Dao-Protector that his decision was an incomparably firm one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, then,” the
Dao-Protector said, rising to his feet. “I will help you find these
copies. Give me those 5800 black-white pellets.” “Mm.” Ning
nodded, watching as the Dao-Protector entered the Dao Repository
Vault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White…Uncle
White wasn’t just his spirit-beast. More importantly, he was
family. If Ning were to acquire a large pile of divine abilities and
secret arts, but give nothing to Uncle White, he truly would feel
terrible in his heart! In addition, even if he was able to trade for
a large number of secret arts, he would still need a large amount of
time and energy to focus on training in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will spend my time
focusing on comprehending this [Lesser Five Elements Sword],” Ning
mused to himself. The [Flowing Watersource] was something he could
simply train in. The [Three-Foot Sword]? His current level of
swordplay was somewhat lacking; he couldn’t even execute the first
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. The only thing he could slowly
spend time on comprehending, for now, was the [Lesser Five Elements
Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White
College. Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing atop
a flying boat in the air, and he sent the boat charging downwards as
he entered Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White,” Ning
called out as he landed into the courtyard. Whoosh. A large white
hound bounded over from nearby. It was the Whitewater Hound. “Ning,
son. You have apprenticed yourself? Which one is your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Diancai,”
Ning replied, his face covered with joy. The Whitewater Hound’s
face became filled with delight and astonishment as well. “An
Immortal?” Prior to this, he had chatted with Ning and also made
guesses regarding which Primal Daoist would be Ning’s master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, this is
the Ki Refining technique I traded for you, the [Flowing
Watersource],” Ning said. “You absolutely cannot reveal this
technique to any outsiders; if you do, the Oath of Blood sworn to the
Dao of the Heavens will punish you, and your soul will be destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded. Formal disciples, retainers,
spirit-beasts…all those who lived within the Black-White College
had to swear the Oath of Blood to the Dao of the Heavens! After all,
retainers and spirit-beasts all had the chance to learn some top-tier
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it,” Ning
said, handing over the [Flowing Watersource], a thick, coiled up
booklet. “This is the first scroll; you can train with it directly
to the peak Primal Daoist level. After we reach the Primal Daoist
level, we can go trade for the second scroll.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for
troubling yourself, my boy Ning.” Although the Whitewater Hound had
never heard of this technique before, he could guess that given Ning
had purchased it for him, it definitely wouldn’t be poor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Uncle
White, I’m going to go train.” Swoosh! Ning’s heart was pumping
mightily right now, and he was filled with eagerness. Naturally, he
charged directly towards the underground quiet room he had prepared
for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth Peak had many
buildings atop it; naturally, it also had some private rooms that
were used for Immortal cultivators to train in. All of these private
rooms had grand formations set up around them that were linked up to
the grand formation which protected the entire Black-White College as
a whole. Once one entered secluded meditation, not even Immortals
could hope to barge in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Creaaaaak!” The
stone door slammed shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the ten foot
wide stone room. The ceiling up above was filled with many luminous
jewels; these jewels naturally weren’t as extravagant and costly as
the ones in the Carefree Caverns, but they were still extraordinary.
The light from them made it so that the stone room was perpetually
kept bright by the light of the jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning sat there in
the lotus position atop his jade bed. The runes inscripted onto the
jade bed had the effect of calming one’s heart. “[Flowing
Watersource]!” Ning flipped through the [Flowing Watersource] in
his hands, spending a full hour reading it as he completely memorized
the entire book. The memories of Immortal practitioners were
exceptionally good. For someone like Ning, who had reached the
‘divine sense’ level, they could actually flip through all the
memories in their soul which they had acquired since they were a
child, just like flipping through a book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” A flame
appeared out of nowhere within Ning’s hand, and it burned the
[Flowing Watersource] to ash. An Immortal-ranked Ki Refining
technique like this definitely was not permitted to be revealed to
the outside world. Thus, upon finishing reading this technique, one
had to destroy it. Thus, killing a disciple of the Black-White
College in order to gain some top-tier techniques was completely
impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s begin.”
Ning waved his hand, and a jade green flask landed on the floor
before him. He opened the bottle, and a dense elemental aura wafted
out. The green jade bottle had fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence within. Originally, Ning had used up just five kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence in order to break through from the peak
Xiantian level to the early Zifu level, and had also solidified his
base as an early Zifu level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absorb.” Ning
opened his mouth, and instantly, the liquefied elemental essence
began to surge out from the green jade bottle and enter Ning’s
mouth. As it did…it quickly distilled into vast amounts of
elemental energy, which surged into his Zifu Violet Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the boundless
void of his Zifu Violet Palace. There was a lake there. “Rumble…”
Suddenly, the entire Violet Palace began to shudder as an endless
torrent of elemental energy surged inwards and was converted into
elemental ki. The lake of elemental ki began to slowly expand in
accordance with the method prescribed in Ning’s [Flowing
Watersource] technique, and it began to slowly swivel as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splash…splash…it
continuously swiveled, and as it did, it began to move faster and
faster. Soon, the entire Zifu Lake had transformed into an enormous
whirlpool, causing the deep heart of the lake to grow deeper and
deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formerly placid,
flat lake had transformed into a whirlpool; it was like an awl, its
depth having instantly increased hundreds of times over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thunderous explosion.
In the deepest part of the whirlpool Zifu Lake, a hole suddenly
appeared, which ravenously began to produce new elemental ki. This
hole was the ‘Watersource’ of the [Flowing Watersource]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Middle Zifu level.”
Ning continued to absorb the liquefied elemental essence from the
jade bottle, continuing to increase his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deepest part of his
Zifu Lake was now a thousand times deeper than it had been in the
past. The absorption and transformation process was clearly much
faster than it had been, and the elemental ki that was transformed
and produced by the Watersource was purer than before as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The late Zifu
level!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 28 - Tradition
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had already
reached the Dao Domain level, and his highest level of
accomplishments was in the water-element of the Five Elements. For
him, comprehending the [Flowing Watersource] was naturally very easy.
Although this was his first time training in it, he thoroughly
understood the Zifu level portion of the technique, and even
comprehended the majority of the Wanxiang level of the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words, if he
so chose, Ning could, at one breath, train straight to the Wanxiang
Adept level. But of course, the prerequisite was that he had enough
liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
elemental ki in his Zifu Lake was slowly swiveling. The waters of the
lake were now swirling in a very slow manner, but the closer to the
bottom, the faster the whirling motion was. At the very bottom of the
lake, in the Watersource, the whirlpool was spinning with incredible
force. As the amount of elemental ki in the Zifu Lake grew, the power
of the whirlpool grew as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
Watersource grew deeper and deeper. The elemental ki it produced grew
more and more pure as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training for
roughly an hour…with a rumble, the entire Zifu Violet Palace began
to tremble. The vast lake of elemental ki’s Watersource once more
transformed, and the purity of the elemental ki once more
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Peak Zifu level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast Violet
Palace region, the turbid waters of the lake continued to slowly
expand. However, in terms of quality, the elemental ki had already
reached the ultimate level possible at the Zifu Disciple level; there
was no way to increase it any further. The only thing possible was to
constantly increase the quantity of ki and expand it in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the still room.
The bright jewels continued to gleam brilliantly. Ning, seated on the
jade bed in the lotus position, opened his eyes and glanced at the
emerald jade bottle placed before him. He nodded slowly. “I spent
nearly forty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, and managed to
surge all the way to the peak Zifu Disciple level as a Ki Refiner.
Only, to break through from the peak Zifu level to the early Wanxiang
level, and while using a top-tier Ki Refining technique…the amount
of liquefied elemental essence that will be needed is quite
shocking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wanxiang ‘Myriad
Manifestations’ level was an extremely unusual level. Some of the
Manifestations possessed by Wanxiang Adepts were merely those of
countless stars gleaming in a night sky. But some Manifestations,
such as those of Daoist Mu Xiao or Daoist Xu Li, had a brilliant moon
amidst the sea of stars. Thus, the Manifestation technique they
demonstrated was that of a grand moonlight hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to legend,
top-tier Manifestations would generate trillions of stars, the
brilliant moon, and the blazing sun, all at the same time! And only
the truly supreme Manifestations could, during the peak Wanxiang
stage, have the ‘Jade Rabbit emerge from the brilliant moon, the
Golden Crow emerge from the blazing sun’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The emergence of the
Jade Rabbit, the appearance of the Golden Crow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This, and this alone,
symbolized that one’s foundations were perfect. This was the
so-called ‘foundation of a Celestial Immortal’. If you didn’t
reach this stage, there was no way you could become a Celestial
Immortal at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But where did the
supreme Manifestations come from? In truth, they relied on the
practitioner having built up an extremely large ‘Zifu Lake’
during the Zifu level. The Zifu Lake is the fundamental foundation
for an Immortal cultivator; the deeper and wider the lake is, the
deeper the practitioner’s elemental ki foundation would be, and the
more astonishing a Manifestation they would be able to create.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some poor-quality
techniques will result in a Zifu Lake that is both shallow and small.
Upon reaching the peak Zifu level, they won’t even be able to
expand the size of the lake; they won’t have any hope of becoming
Wanxiang Adepts.” Ning sighed to himself. That was exactly the case
for his own Ji clan; their techniques were simply too poor, and the
Zifu Lakes that they were able to create were correspondingly weak to
the point where they could never break through to acquire
Manifestations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Manifestation of
the Stars was the weakest Manifestation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Manifestation of
the Bright Moon was on a slightly higher level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Manifestation of
the Sun and the Moon was the best Manifestation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, for the Jade
Rabbit and the Golden Crow to appear during the peak Wanxiang Adept
level was proof that one’s foundation was perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on the
recorded experiences of disciples of the Black-White College
regarding the [Flowing Watersource],” Ning mused, “Upon reaching
the peak Zifu level, if one absorbs a further 250 kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence, then one will gain the Manifestation of
the Sun and the Moon. If one absorbs 400 kilograms before one breaks
through to the Wanxiang Adept level…then at the peak Wanxiang
level, the Manifestation will produce the Jade Rabbit and the Golden
Crow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
benefits of having a sect; the experiences of the forerunners would
guide the latecomers in knowing what to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, this was
an Immortal-ranked Ki Refining technique. If it was a poorer
technique…even if one had unlimited amounts of liquefied elemental
essence, one wouldn’t be able to absorb it all. It would be
useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent two hours
to reach the peak Zifu Disciple level. Next, Ning flipped through the
[Lesser Five Elements Sword] tome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how things
were in supreme schools, for disciples the schools cared about.
Training was as simple as this. Once they reached a certain level of
insight, the school would make it so that they could save as much
time as possible in training, allowing them to focus their attention
on comprehending the Dao, analyzing sword arts, divine abilities,
etc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword arts!”
Ning’s eyes were gleaming, and a hungry look was in them. Ever
since he had reached the Dao Domain level, the sword arts manuals of
the Ji clan had become useless to him; his level of insight was
simply too high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To a true Sword
Immortal…an incredibly deep and profound sword art could let them
unleash incredibly great power in battle. Although Ning was only at
the Dao Domain level, if he focused on comprehending sword arts, he
could gain insights into sword arts which were on a higher level than
he himself was at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Lesser Five
Elements Sword]! One of the top five sword arts in the entire
Black-White College, something which even Immortals would be wiling
to study.” The cost of this sword arts manual was close to that of
a divine ability manual; from this, one could see how powerful it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently flipped
through the pages. Stretching out his fingers, he formed them into
the shape of a sword, testing the movements. These still rooms inside
the Black-White College were specially designed for its formal
disciples to train in, and the formation protecting these rooms were
linked together with the grand formation which protected the entire
College. Even if one tested out techniques within…as long as one
was not an Immortal, there was no way one could possibly damage the
still rooms in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read while testing
out the movements, completely absorbed in this sword technique. He
felt as though he were back in his youth, when he was training in the
[108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] for the first time. Back then,
his father taught him, but this time, Ning analyzed everything by
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was analyzing
this sword technique. Within the estate located on another mountain
peak within the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Bladask, junior apprentice-brother Bladask,” a
voice rang out. “Senior apprentice-brother Bu. Please, come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A calm voice rang out
from within the estate. Instantly, an azure-robed, long-haired man
drifted in. This estate had a Zifu Disciple and some ordinary mortals
within it, all of whom saluted. They naturally couldn’t compare in
status to a formal disciple of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask why you
have come here, senior apprentice-brother Bu?” A white-robed youth
walked over. It was Bloodrinker Bladask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Bladask,” the azure-robed man laughed, “I
heard that during our recent recruitment, the mountain tunnel which
you guarded was broken through, correct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask’s face sank.
This was a humiliation for him! That time, Ning had forced him to use
a sword formation to block. Given his proud nature, he naturally
remembered the matter. Thus, when Ning and Northson had undergone the
formal ceremony, he had not attended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Bladask
said coldly. The azure-robed man laughed. “Junior
apprentice-brother Bladask, don’t be angry. I imagine you don’t
know this yet but…that Ji Ning is so talented that he has already
been accepted by our College’s Immortal Diancai as his first,
senior apprentice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of shock
appeared on Bladask’s face. “Immortal Diancai?” Immortal
Diancai was a Sword Immortal! As for Bladask, the path he walked was
the Dao of the Sword as well. In the past, he had desired to become
Immortal Diancai’s apprentice, but formal disciples, upon entering
the school, were generally apprenticed to Primal Daoists. It was very
rare for Immortals to directly choose them as an apprentice. As time
had gone on, they had all grown accustomed to this, and he felt that
it was normal that Immortal Diancai had not taken him as a disciple.
But this Ji Ning had actually become apprenticed directly to Immortal
Diancai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about it?”
Bladask had a sharp look in his eyes. “His future level of strength
will depend on himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed man
nodded. “Right. Training depends on one’s self. However, junior
apprentice-brother Bladask, the reason why you lost to Ning last time
was only because you were only permitted to use a single flying
sword. You weren’t able to unleash your true power at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask didn’t say a
word. In terms of power, he felt that he was far more powerful than
that kid named Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And, junior
apprentice-brother Bladask, you should also know,” chuckled the
azure-robed man, “That our Black-White College has an unspoken
custom; all new apprentices will be taught a lesson at the Dao Debate
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask nodded. The
battles at the Dao Debate Palace were an extremely safe sort of
sparring matches. The Black-White College’s formal disciples loved
to engage in this sort of battles against each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All new disciples
were supreme geniuses in their former organizations, and are
accustomed to being arrogant. The Dao Debate battles…they can help
these new disciples wake up. Help them understand a certain
principle; that there is a heaven beyond the heavens, and that there
are geniuses beyond geniuses.” The azure-robed man laughed. “I
wonder, junior apprentice-brother Bladask…would you be interested
in having the chance to help that genius, Ji Ning, wake up and
understand that in the Black-White College, he’s nothing more than
an ordinary figure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask’s eyes
instantly lit up. After hesitating just a moment, he said in a cold
voice, “I will only spar with Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are quite a
few other fellow disciples who want to fight,” the azure-robed man
said with a laugh. “What we need to do right now is to go invite Mu
Northson and Ji Ning to a battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was currently
standing atop his Azure Dragon construct, flying through the air
towards his own residence. “The Black-White College really lives up
to its name.” Whenever he thought about the secret manual on
constructs which he held in his hands, he felt a blazing fire in his
heart. This manual held answers to many of the questions he had
regarding the Dao of Constructs, and he had been completely absorbed
by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Dragon
construct which Northson stood upon descended from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Twinwood.” A blue-clothed maiden in front of his
gate called out to him. “Who are you, senior apprentice-sister?”
Northson remembered seeing this woman amongst the other formal
disciples of the Black-White College; she had been with them during
the grand initiation ceremony. Immortal practitioners had formidable
memories; after having seen her once, he had firmly memorized her
appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed woman
laughed, “My name is Winterain. You can simply address me as senior
apprentice-sister Winterain.” Northson said happily, “I don’t
have a single servant yet, and thus ended up treating you
discourteously by having you wait outside. Please forgive me, senior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the way in which
he acted, the blue-clothed woman felt a hint of goodwill towards
Northson. She thus said, “Junior apprentice-brother Northson, I’ve
come here to invite you to the Dao Debate Palace…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Debate Palace!”
Northson’s eyes instantly lit up. He had read the black-and-white
book, and knew that the duels in the Dao Debate Palace were extremely
safe. They had nothing to do with elemental ki, power, or magic
treasures; what they competed in was comprehension regarding the Dao
and the ways in which they would apply the Dao. This is why it was
described as a ‘Dao Debate’. In addition, there would generally
be stakes in these ‘debates’, such as black-white pellets or
liquefied elemental essences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to spar
with you, senior apprentice-sister, is something I’ve been looking
forward to,” Northson said eagerly. “Then let’s go,” the
blue-clothed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Northson’s eyes were filled with an eagerness for combat. Geniuses
all had their pride. In the past, they had never before met their
matches. Although they knew that these old disciples of the
Black-White College were all extraordinary, in their hearts, the new
students would still feel an eagerness to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-clothed woman
and Northson flew rapidly through the air, heading towards the Dao
Debate Palace.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_29___Ji_Ning_s_Early_Ins"></A>
Chapter 29 - Ji Ning’s Early Insights Into the Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering Dao Debate
Palace was located at the very top of a mountain peak, and the
figures of quite a few people could be seen within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Debate
Palace…it had always been the place where the disciples of the
Black-White College enjoyed to gather at the most. These genius
disciples, all of whom had arrogance bred into their bones, would
often spar with each other here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ray of light shot out
from the Dao Debate Palace. Immediately afterwards, a blue-clothed
maiden flew out after it. “Junior apprentice-brother Twinwood,
junior apprentice-brother Twinwood!” The blue-robed woman was
standing atop a giant flower basket, chasing after him at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Winterain, why are you chasing after me?” Mu
Northson, standing atop that Azure Dragon construct, had a look of
rage on his normally bashful face. “This was what you all planned
this entire time, wasn’t it? Hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blue-robed maiden,
Winterain, shook her head and said, “Junior apprentice-brother
Twinwood, actually, you can’t blame your fellow disciples. In our
Black-White College…throughout our history, each time a new
disciple joins us, that person will taught a vicious lesson at the
Dao Debate Palace. This has already become a tradition. Although it
isn’t one of the laws of the College, it has been passed down for
countless generations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teach a lesson to
new disciples?” Northson stared at her. “If it really was just a
lesson, why did the need to pretend to be on par with me at the
start?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That makes the
lesson a deep one, one that you won’t forget,” Winterain
explained. “It is to help you understand that there is a heaven
beyond the heavens, and geniuses beyond geniuses! Actually, when I
first joined the college, I suffered in a similar manner. This
happens in each generation; every new apprentice-brother and
apprentice-sister will suffer this lesson. It is meant to tamp down
their pride. The elders of our College all tacitly approve of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Northson
understood this principle, he was still only fourteen years old. In
addition, the two Dao Debates he had just engaged in had caused him
to lose two hundred black-white pellets and ten kilograms of
liquefied elemental essences. Although it was just a small bet, his
losses had still caused him quite a bit of heartache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson clasped his
hands and said, “Senior apprentice-sister, you actually gave me a
veiled warning earlier. I was too rash and impetuous. However,
there’s no need to say too many words of reconciliation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Northson,
mounted on his Azure Dragon construct, departed at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Winterain
watched as Northson departed. She couldn’t help but shake her head.
Although she had gone to invite Northson to participate, the simple
interactions she had with him had made her feel very well disposed
towards this junior apprentice-brother of hers. But because this was
a tradition…it wasn’t appropriate for her to intervene in the Dao
Debate Palace. At most, she could give a hidden warning. Fortunately,
this time, he had only lost twice before giving up. If he had
continued to duel, his losses would have grown increasingly dire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A heaven beyond the
heavens, and geniuses beyond geniuses!” Northson was seated on the
rooftop of one of the houses in his estate, a jade bottle of wine in
his hands. He raised his head, taking a swig.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cough, cough.”
Northson drank too quickly, and he began to cough. “In the future,
I can’t be too careless.” Northson had slowly calmed down and
regained his mental clarity. He had entered the Black-White College
at the age of fourteen. Ever since he was young, he had never met a
match. The unconscious pride and arrogance he felt was what made him
go spar against his fellow apprentices. He knew that the foes were
very powerful, but he still felt he should be remarkable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth Peak. The
still room. Ning was still completely absorbed by the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Lesser Five
Elements Sword] was divided into a total of nine chapters: [Metal
Element], [Wood Element], [Water Element], [Fire Element], [Earth
Element], [Duality], [Tripartite], [Four Symbols], and [Five
Elements].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single chapter
allowed one to start from the basics, then go progressively deeper.
The basic parts were even inferior to the “Rain Line” technique
he had developed. But at a high level, this was a swordplay suitable
for a Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was carefully
meditating on the [Water Element], [Fire Element], and the wind of
the [Wood Element] parts 1. These were the three aspects of the Dao
which he had the deepest level of understanding about. As for metal
and earth…he was lacking considerably in these two aspects.
Naturally, he wouldn’t squander his energy in analyzing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Drizzling Rain!”
Ning murmured to himself, and the sword-fingers of his right hand
shot out. In midair, drops of rain began to appear out of nowhere.
These raindrops struck downwards like meteors, slamming against the
walls of the still room. A hazy, blurry light appeared on the walls
of the room, covered with layers of mysterious runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” A look
of joy appeared on Ning’s face. “This skill is even more powerful
than my ‘Rain Line’ technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When developing new
techniques, one could only develop techniques at the level of one’s
own enlightenment. But when learning, one could learn techniques that
were at a higher level than one was currently at.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fire, water, wind.
I’ve learned a total of seven major sword stances from these three
parts. They are considerably superior to the sword techniques I
developed myself, but the increase in power isn’t that noticeable.”
Ning immediately flipped through the book in front of him, straight
to the [Duality] part. “Only when these different insights
regarding different Daos are merged together and unleashed in a
single attack will the power of the attack increase explosively.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Duality] part had
a total of eighty nine different sword stances! For example, there
were two Duality stances formed from joining the wind and the fire.
There were two others formed from joining the earth and the fire.
There were yet two more from joining metal and earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, the sword
techniques developed from joining together the profundities of two
different Daos were all included within this part, the [Duality]
part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joining different Daos
together truly could allow for the power of a technique to increase
explosively. The power could jump to a whole new level! This is what
‘sword arts’ were! There were some Ki Refiners who could rely on
exceptionally powerful sword arts and flying sword formations to kill
same-level Fiendgod Body Refiners, even if they were in possession of
divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword arts, when
trained to an ultimate level, were not at all inferior to divine
abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another hour
passed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” Ning’s
right hand waved out once more, and a sword-finger shot out.
Instantly, a ray of azure fire slashed through the air in the form of
a fiery sword, seeming to vaguely shatter space itself. It slammed
directly against the stone wall, and the glowing layer of runes atop
the wall once more lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success. The
[Azureflame Duality Sword]!” A look of delight immediately appeared
on Ning’s face. The [Azureflame Duality Sword] was a sword
technique that contained the fusion of the True Meaning of Water and
the True Meaning of Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
technique vastly outstripped Ning’s former supreme attack,
[Drizzling Rain]. As for the [Rain Line] technique he had developed
at Swallow Mountain? That couldn’t even be mentioned in the same
breath. The power of this new technique was formed from joining
together two completely different True Meanings of the Dao! But of
course, the reason why he was able to develop it so quickly was
because Ning had a high level of comprehension regarding the Dao to
begin with, and his foundation was very solid. In addition, he had
seen the Black-White Diagram, which had been of great help in
inspiring him regarding how to join together different Daos.
Naturally, he had only needed an hour in order to be successful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a case of
making a natural breakthrough after accumulating experience!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once again flipped
to a new part of the book. The [Tripartite] chapter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This chapter had a
total of ninety two sword stances. There was a [Tripartite] sword
attack based on the fusion of earth, metal, and fire; there was also
one for the fusion of wind, earth, and metal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, however,
without question, he was only capable of learning a very small part
of the stances within; the sword technique formed from the fusion of
wind, water, and fire. But there were a total of eight stances for
this type of [Tripartite] sword attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dark. Only now
did Ning leave the still room, jubilant. “I spent ten-plus years at
Swallow Mountain, then comprehended the Dao within the Stellar Hall
of the underwater estate…but I’ve never been able to acquire a
truly powerful sword art. Now that I have obtained the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword], I really am like a tiger who has gained wings.”
Ning laughed with delight and glee. He truly felt wonderful. This
feeling of learning a truly powerful sword art really was wonderful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have already
learned two of the powerful sword techniques of the [Duality]
chapter. Of the [Tripartite] chapter, I have learned one sword
technique as well.” Ning smiled to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Tripartite]
chapter represented the fusion of three different True Meanings of
the Dao. This sort of multiplicative power resulted in a soaring rise
in power! Fortunately, he had previously reached a bottleneck in his
understanding of the Waterflame Lotus technique while meditating
before the Black-White Diagram. With that as his foundation, he was
able to, in four short hours, develop an extremely powerful sword
technique from the [Tripartite] chapter - the [Tripartite Lotus
Sword]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Tripartite Lotus
Sword], compared to Ning’s Waterflame Lotus, was like a different
melody that was played with the same level of skill; they were two
different approaches that led to the same result. However, it was
actually even more profound and sharp! This was because Ning had only
developed it after comparing the similarities between the two
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine it will be
very hard for my sword arts to improve significantly in a short
period of time.” Ning understood this; after all, he only had some
insights into three of the Five Elements, and was at most able to
comprehend the [Tripartite] chapter. As for the [Four Symbols] and
the [Five Elements] chapters, he was completely unable to understand
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a single short day,
as a Ki Refiner, he had risen from the early Zifu level to the peak
Zifu level. His sword arts had consecutively risen by three complete
tiers. After having learned a powerful technique from the [Lesser
Five Elements Sword], the [Tripartite Lotus Sword], he had reached a
limit. This caused Ning to naturally feel an incomparable joy in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” The
Whitewater Hound was walking over from far away. He sent mentally,
“There is another formal disciple of the Black-White College within
your estate who has come to pay you a visit. He has waited for a very
long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formal disciple?
Here to see me?” Ning was surprised. He hurriedly walked towards
the door; he couldn’t slight his fellow disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He soon walked out and
saw, from afar, an azure-robed man who was standing leisurely with
his hands clasped, staring at the crescent moon in the sky. The man
seemed to sense Ning’s footsteps, and he immediately turned to
look, a smile appearing on his face. “Junior apprentice-brother
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask who you
are, senior apprentice-brother?” Upon seeing this person, Ning
immediately knew that he was a fellow disciple, because he had met
this person in the Headmaster’s Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Bu Ying.”
The azure-robed, long-haired man laughed. “My Daoist title is
Hawkfish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bu, why have you come here?” Ning asked. The
azure-robed man laughed loudly. “I saw how talented you appeared at
the Headmaster’s Palace, junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, and
then I saw you be accepted by Immortal Diancai as an apprentice…I
imagine that you must be extraordinary, and so some of our fellow
disciples wish to have a sparring competition with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Competition?” Ning
had a sudden thought. “A spar at the Dao Debate Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed man
laughed. “Right, the Dao Debate Palace. To engage in a discussion
on the Dao at the Dao Debate Palace is a superb affair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued. The
black-and-white book he had read had discussed the Dao Debate Palace;
there was no danger at all in sparring within the Dao Debate Palace,
and the disciples of the Black-White College all delighted in
sparring there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…because he
had read the intelligence report Northmont Baiwei had given him, Ning
knew that the Black-White College had a certain tradition where some
of the new disciples would be taught a lesson and made to suffer a
loss at the Dao Debate Palace. In addition, the old disciples loved
to watch this happen. The first reason was to help these newer
disciples wake up and temper their pride. The second reason? They,
too, had suffered this in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Ning’s
eyes lit up, and he laughed, “I, too, would deeply desire to spar
against my fellow disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” The
azure-haired man, Bu Ying, began to laugh. “Let’s go. Let’s go
to the Dao Debate Palace.” The two immediately mounted on their
magic treasures and soared into the skies, heading towards the Dao
Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Bu Ying
were flying through the night sky. Suddenly, a ray of light shot
towards them from the ground below. “Senior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning.” A white-robed youth, mounted on an Azure Dragon construct,
came to greet them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson?” Ning was surprised. Northson was
reeking of wine. What Ning didn’t understand…was that just before
this, Northson had been drinking wine on the roof of his estate. When
he saw Ning and Ying soar past, he had flown into the air as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson said
frantically, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, have you been
invited to go to the Dao Debate Palace…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Twinwood!” The azure-robed Bu Ying frowned. But
Northson continued frantically, “Don’t believe them. They are
going to intentionally deceive you to make you lose black-white
pellets and liquefied elemental essence to them. I lost to them;
don’t be deceived by them as well.” Northson was clearly quite
frantic, afraid that Ning would suffer in the same way he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed man, Bu
Ying, barked at him, “Junior apprentice-brother Twinwood, there are
always some small stakes when one engages in a duel in the Dao Debate
Palace. For someone to win, someone must lose. Can it be that you
think things are only fair when you win? If everyone has to be a
winner, then there’s no point to even going to the Dao Debate
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ning.” Northson was extremely nervous. “Junior
apprentice-brother Northson,” Ning said reassuringly, “No need to
say anything more. I know what is going on. If I lose, I can’t
blame anyone else. However, I, Ji Ning, still have a certain degree
of confidence in my heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was frantic.
“Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning,
who had read the intelligence report long ago, actually knew exactly
what was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going with
you,” Northson immediately said. In his heart, he thought to
himself that if he were by Ning’s side, he could at least try to
help persuade Ning and ensure Ning didn’t lose too much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three flew towards
the Dao Debate Palace at high speed. Soon, the towering Dao Debate
Palace could be seen at the top of the mountain peak, shrouded by the
night sky. Ning’s group of three charged downwards, moving towards
the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 - The Battle at the Dao Debate Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s group of
three landed at the gates to the Dao Debate Palace. As they looked
inwards, they saw that although it was night, the insides of the Dao
Debate Palace were brightly lit, and the sound of calm laughter rang
out from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, I’ll accept these hundred black-white
pellets and five kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.” The
speaker was a white-robed man, who had a blood-drop pattern atop his
white robes. It was Bloodrinker Bladask. Bladask had a hint of
delight on his face; clearly, he was quite happy at having won a
victory in the Dao Debate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him, seated
in the lotus position, was a long-haired maiden dressed in water-blue
robes. She arose and flew over, landing nearby and shaking her head.
“Three years ago, I was able to beat you by a hair, junior
apprentice-brother Bladask. I didn’t expect that this time, I’d
be defeated by you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your junior
apprentice-brother had to work very hard to just barely eke out a
victory.” Bladask, normally quite prideful, was currently quite
humble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, when sparring, it’s all about that
hint of a chance at victory. You and junior apprentice-brother
Bladask are comparable; only, junior apprentice-brother Bladask’s
attacks are just a hair sharper than yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus…” The various men and women were
chatting amongst themselves. At this moment, Ji Ning, Mu Northson,
and Bu Ying entered the Dao Debate Hall, and they all turned to look
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus?” Ning’s
gaze instantly turned towards that woman who had been referred to
everyone as ‘Ninelotus’. She was dressed in casual, water-blue
robes, and had long, black hair. Although her face could be
considered beautiful, she was slightly less attractive than even Meng
Xin. Only, this senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus had a certain
graceful aura about her. She was like a fairy lotus, causing the
fellow male disciples around her to unconsciously be drawn to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given her aura and
demeanor, I imagine she must have an extraordinary background,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus.” Upon seeing Ninelotus, Bu Ying’s
voice went slightly higher. A smile on his face, he hurriedly said,
“These two are the new disciples that just joined our Black-White
College. This is Mu Northson, and this is Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus turned her
gaze towards them, a hint of a smile on her lips. “I heard that
during the day, junior apprentice-brother Mu Northson was defeated
twice while sparring here at the Dao Debate Palace, and was so angry
that he left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was rather
bashful to begin with. A hint of awkwardness immediately appeared on
his face. “That’s only because he just entered the school, and
has never before suffered a setback like that,” Ning spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus looked
towards Ning. “So you are Ji Ning, who Patriarch Diancai took on as
his senior apprentice.” Ning nodded. “I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Pu Yinig
hurriedly said, “Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, you are the
disciple of Immortal Diancai. Senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus,
however, is the disciple of Immortal Fivecraze.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciple of
Immortal Fivecraze?” Ning was surprised. “I just arrived back at
the College tonight, and so I wasn’t able to attend the grand
ceremony earlier,” Ninelotus said softly. “Now that you’ve
arrived, junior apprentice-brother, are you willing to begin a Dao
Debate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning nodded.
“I would very much like to spar against my senior fellow
disciples.” Ninelotus laughed. “Then you have to be careful. I
just lost a round myself, just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning!” A cold voice rang out. Ning turned to
look. The speaker was the white-robed Bloodrinker Bladask. Bladask’s
purpose for coming was to defeat Ning, and thus vent the anger in his
heart. He hadn’t expected to encounter Ninelotus, whom he had
always admired very much. He had gone all out to defeat Ninelotus, in
the hopes that this senior apprentice-sister would remember him in
the future. Who would have imagined that after Ning arrived, he would
immediately get into such an involved conversation with senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bladask,” Ning laughed. Bladask responded in a
cold voice, “Do you remember our battle at the cave?” Ning
nodded. “I do. That time, I wished to tell you my name, but you,
senior apprentice-brother Bladask, refused to let me do so. You said
that we’d never meet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look on Bladask’s
face changed as he heard this. Ning laughed and continued, “I
didn’t even tell you my name, but it appears you already know it,
senior apprentice-brother. Might I ask why you are calling for me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask’s gaze was
filled with a cold light. “Dare you go onto the dais and debate the
Dao with me?” Ning turned his head to look towards the giant Dao
Debate Palace. “Go onto the dais and debate the Dao?” The giant
palace was quite similar to a giant dining room from his past life.
There were quite a few seats nearby, and in the center, there was an
enormous battle arena. At the same time, at each side of the arena,
there was a tall stone pillar. The Dao debaters would seat themselves
atop the stone pillars and rely on golems to engage in a battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, standing to
the side, said, “Junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you must be
careful. The person I just lost to was junior apprentice-brother
Bladask.” Bladask, hearing this, felt all the more jealous, and the
cold light in his eyes grew increasingly sharp. “Dare you, or dare
you not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come here
precisely to spar with my fellow disciples. Why wouldn’t I dare?”
Ning shook his head and laughed. “It’s just a hundred black-white
pellets and five kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, a hundred
black-white pellets and five kilograms of liquefied elemental essence
is just the smallest wager possible.” Bladask laughed coldly.
“Black-white pellets are gifted to us by the College and are
extremely rare. I’m willing to wager fifty kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence. Do you dare accept?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. Bladask
continued in his cold voice, “Oh, right. As a new disciple, you
only have fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. I imagine
that you probably wouldn’t be able to produce so much, junior
apprentice-brother.” As he spoke, he waved his hand and produced an
insignia. “This is an elemental mark from the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. It represents a thousand taels of liquefied elemental
essence, which is to say, fifty kilograms. If you take it to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain, you can trade it for fifty kilograms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare you accept my
wager?” Bladask looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere
instantly turned stiff. The other disciples immediately understood
that there was something not quite right between Bladask and Ning.
Previously, when they had battled Northson, they had only made the
smallest of wagers; after all, nobody wanted to generate enmity and
strife amongst their fellow disciples. For Bladask to increase the
wager was a clear sign that he wanted to mistreat Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a new disciple were
forced to take out fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence,
wouldn’t that mean they wouldn’t have anything to train with?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, they had
no idea….that although Bladask originally did want to fight against
Ning, he hadn’t planned on being so nasty. Only, he had noticed how
engaged Ninelotus had been in her conversation with Ning. Ninelotus
normally would say just a few meaningless phrases to him when he
spoke to her, but towards Ning, she voluntarily spoke out to him.
This made Bladask feel quite mistreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How am I inferior to
this Ji Ning? Why is it that senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus seems
to treat him differently, from the very moment they met each other?
In terms of treasures, family heritage, power, or clan, this Ji Ning
is inferior to me!” The look in Bladask’s eyes grew still colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Ninelotus said. “You just joined the
school. Let me lend you fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence.” When he heard these words, the angry aura emanating from
Bladask grew only more terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning only laughed.
“No need. Since senior apprentice-brother Bladask wishes to wager
fifty kilograms, then I will accept.” Ning waved his hand, and
several insignias appeared as well. “These are elemental marks of
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. They can be traded for a thousand
taels as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” “Elemental
marks of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain?” All of them stared at
the elemental marks. Bladask had entered the school long ago, and had
gone adventuring in the outside world; it was normal for him to have
acquired some treasures and traded them to the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain for elemental marks! But Ji Ning had just entered the
school, and yet he was able to casually bring out a thousand taels as
well…this was quite extraordinary. What none of them realized was
that Ning had won these marks at the duel at the Carefree Caverns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although news regarding
the battle at the Carefree Caverns had spread out, these disciples of
the Black-White College knew very little about it. Of the Primal
Daoists, only Wu Xiu knew a bit more about these matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred
black-white pellets and fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental
essences.” An old voice rang out. A white-haired old man who stood
at the side of the Dao Debate Palace had spoken out. “Since you
both accept, then let this be the wager.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, I’m going to
ask the two disciples to each select their golem.” The white-haired
elder continued to speak. He was a golem as well; he was responsible
for some of the matters here in the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Bladask both
immediately headed towards a side door; there were many golems placed
within this side door to the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They entered a small
hall. The white-haired elder pointed to the many golems; there were
at least hundreds of them present. These golems were black, and
looked like stone sculptures. “These golems have identical
elemental ki cores. The energy they release will all be at the early
Wanxiang Adept level. That way, those reincarnated Immortals who are
within our school who are in possession of a divine sense won’t be
able to use it to influence the battle significantly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Divine
sense was slightly superior to peak Zifu level power, but roughly the
same as the early Wanxiang level. Even if it was used to control
weapons, it wouldn’t impact the battle too much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These golems all
come with their own weapons,” the white-haired elder continued.
“They include flying swords, flying needles, giant warhammers…in
short, all types of magic treasures are present! Choose a golem based
on the type of weapon you prefer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask was very quick
to make his choice. He immediately walked towards a golem, placing it
on the golem’s body and quickly binding it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go now. You
can take your time in choosing.” Bladask gave Ning a glance, then
immediately left. As for that golem, it transformed into a blur as it
followed after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectating
disciples within the Dao Debate Palace, Northson and Ninelotus
included, numbered eight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wager is
actually this large. A hundred black-white pellets is one thing, but
fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence! Junior
apprentice-brother Bladask is going a bit too far. Hazing the new
disciples is one thing, but you can’t do it like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is a bit much, I
agree.” The fellow disciples were all chatting amongst themselves.
Right at this moment, Bladask walked back from the side door, then
leapt directly forward by more than three hundred meters before
landing atop a stone pillar that was thirty meters tall. He took a
seat atop the stone pillar. Swoosh! That golem also leapt up and
landed within the battle arena, then quietly waited there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He chose the Polaris
Golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bladask really is being quite vicious; he actually
chose the Polaris Golem which he is the most proficient with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which golem
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning will choose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were no
differences in quality in the golems; the only question was whether
or not one was accustomed to using them. If, for example, Ning were
to choose a golem that used a giant warhammer, he wouldn’t be able
to unleash much of his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning is coming out.” They all looked over.
Northson’s eyes were filled with worry. As for Ninelotus, she
stared carefully at Ning, her eyes filled with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked out, a
golem following him. Swoosh! Swoosh! Ning and the golem, in quick
succession, leapt up then landed; Ning landed atop a stone pillar,
sitting down, while the golem landed in the battle arena below,
causing the arena to shudder slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sat on their
stone pillars, staring at each other from afar. Ning and Bladask’s
gazes crossed. They were roughly three hundred meters away from each
other. The golems below them were roughly three hundred meters away
from each other as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!” The
white-haired old man barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…instantly, a
barrier of clear water immediately appeared. It was an enormous,
barrier-type grand sealing formation that completely sealed the
entire arena. Northson and the others were all outside of it, while
Ning and Bladask were within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousandswords
Golem!” Bladask, seated in the lotus position on the distant stone
pillar, gave it a glance, then snorted coldly. “He doesn’t know
his own limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like to ask
you for some guidance, senior apprentice-brother,” Ning called out
in a high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please.” Bladask
shouted back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
disciples all watched with bated breath. The newcomer who had been
accepted by Immortal Diancai as his disciple, Ji Ning. Senior
apprentice-brother Bladask, who had entered the school many years
ago. Which of the two was the stronger?
</P>

Chapter 31 - Shock and Awe (part 1)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Win. Win. Win.” Mu
Northson stood outside the grand sealing formation, staring towards
Ji Ning, who was seated on that distant stone pillar. His eyes were
blazing with hope. “You have to win.” Prior to this, he had lost
two rounds in a row. In his heart, he viewed himself and Ning as
standing on the same side; they were both new disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those old
disciples, they were simply teaching the new disciples a lesson in
accordance with that ‘tradition’. He lost; naturally, he now
hoped that Ning would win a round and gain a bit of face for them,
the two new students. In addition, this Bloodrinker Bladask had gone
too far in making the wagers so large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning is in for it now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bladask really did set a high wager. He showed no
mercy at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old disciples were
all chatting amongst themselves. But as for Ninelotus, she stood
there, staring carefully at Ning, who was within the grand sealing
formation. She said softly, “My fellow disciples, it’s too early
to say such things. It’s hard to say who will win; junior
apprentice-brother Bladask or junior apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Bladask entered the school many years ago. Can it
be that he is inferior to Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus, it isn’t very likely that Ji Ning will
be able to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the disciples
present, Northson included, felt surprised at the words of Ninelotus.
After all, Ninelotus, logically speaking, should be on the side of
the old disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just watch.”
Ninelotus still had that calm smile on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask sat there atop
his stone pillar in the lotus position. He noticed that Ninelotus,
standing outside the sealing formation, was paying more attention to
Ning. This caused his gaze to grow ever-colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the protective
surface armor of the golems you two are controlling has been broken,
that means that you have lost.” The white-haired elder watched from
afar while speaking out. Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golems were
representations of themselves. Breaking through the golem’s armor,
in a real battle, was something comparable to truly killing the
enemy! Naturally, that represented defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you know the
rules, then…begin!” The white-haired elder called out. Within the
vast, empty space inside the sealing formation, the two golems
simultaneously began to move. Ning controlled the Thousandsword
Golem, while Bladask controlled the Polaris Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” “Swish!”
The two golems retreated at the same time, pulling away from each
other. Neither of them wished for their golems to be too close,
because once their protective armor was breached, that would mean
they had lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning! Watch out for this!” Bladask, seated on
that distant stone pillar, let out a loud shout. Immediately
afterwards, he began to control his Polaris Golem, which had seven
flying swords on its back. A savage, baleful aura filled one of the
flying swords which instantly shot out, filling the entire area
nearby with a dense, bloody light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ursae Majoris
Warbreaker!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as junior
apprentice-brother Bladask attacked, he immediately used the Ursae
Majoris Warbreaker. He really is filled with a killing intent right
now.” The spectating disciples in the distance were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying sword
slashed through the skies, and as they did so, it was like an
iron-blooded army was marching forth. A series of bloody lights
flashed, and even the vague sounds of slaughter and warcries could be
heard. They struck directly towards Ning’s Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really does have
quite a bit of a killing intent.” Ning sat there in the lotus
position on his stone pillar. Seeing this, he just let out a soft
laugh. “Let me extinguish that killing intent of his. Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the countless
tiny swords on the back of the Thousandswords Golem instantly flew
out. When it flew out, it was only the size of a sewing needle, but
soon it expanded to the size of a palm. The flashing sword flew
out…and as it did, the entire area became filled with flowing
water, with the flashing sword light submerged within the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Bladask’s
face sank. That flying sword of his, filled with a boundless killing
intent, didn’t give way in the slightest. It struck directly
towards the flowing water. This Ursae Majoris sword…what it needed
was its imposing manner! It couldn’t lose that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying sword struck
directly towards the flood of water. Splash! The flowing water was
blasted apart, but the water then swirled and reformed around the
flying sword, once more entrapping it. As the saying goes, one can
swing a blade at water, but the water will still flow; even a blade
that had been tempered a hundred times, when faced with this sword
light that flowed with endless water, would become as weak as a
finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first blow was
filled with energy. The second was weaker. By the third, there was
nothing left. “Not good.” Bladask’s face changed slightly. He
knew that Ning had blocked him with but a single flying sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used just a
single flying sword to block junior apprentice-brother Bladask’s
Ursae Majoris Warbreaker sword attack. I imagine that junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning isn’t much weaker than junior
apprentice-brother Bladask.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed man, Bu
Ying, said with a frown, “This is the ‘Flowing Water Sword’ of
the [Lesser Five Elements Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Five
Elements Sword]? Are you sure about that, senior apprentice-brother
Ying?” The others all looked towards Bu Ying, puzzlement on their
faces. They had all heard of the famous [Lesser Five Elements Sword],
but they didn’t focus on swordplay…naturally, they didn’t
understand the sword stances of the [Lesser Five Elements Sword] very
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Ying nodded. “I’m
sure. I’ve meditated on the [Lesser Five Elements Sword] before.
This technique is the ‘Flowing Water Sword’ technique within it.
I didn’t expect that although junior apprentice-brother Darknorth
has just entered our school, he has already begin to gain insights
into the [Lesser Five Elements Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus just
listened, smiling gently as she watched the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask couldn’t hear
the conversation going on outside, but he could guess at it. Both
sides had used just a single flying sword, but Ning had actually
blocked him. How could he not feel humiliated? After all, he had
joined the school many years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, receive my Polaris Direwolf Skyripper!”
Bladask let out an angry roar. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six flying
swords on the back of the Polaris Golem all flew out at the same
time. The first flying sword flew back as well, and the seven flying
swords instantly formed into a Polaris Sword Formation. Rumble…in
midair, one enormous star after another began to appear. The seven
giant stars formed into the shape of the Big Dipper, and then a
flashing sword light began to expand rapidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Howwwwwwwwwl!” At
the core of this sword light, an enormous black wolf phantom actually
appeared out of nowhere. The Direwolf raised its head, letting out an
angry howl. And then, still howling, it charged straight towards
Ning. It looked as though the Direwolf was bounding towards Ning, but
in reality, those seven flying swords were launching a simultaneous
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning’s cold
voice rang out. Eight more flying swords flew out from the back of
the Thousandswords Golem. Along with the first flying sword, they
instantly joined together into a simple ‘Nine Palaces Sword
Formation’. Ning had acquired the ‘Nine Yang Sword Formation’
in the underwater estate, and this formation contained quite a few
profound mysteries as well. Although it wasn’t as complicated as
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], it was still extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had quite a bit of
ability with regards to formations, and this ‘Nine Palaces Sword
Formation’ was quite an excellent one as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Nine rays of sword light howled through the air,
leaping forward to greet the giant, advancing Direwolf. As they flew
over, the light of the nine swords suddenly flashed, then transformed
into more than a hundred densely clustered sword shadows. These
hundred-plus sword shadows then quickly transformed into drops of
rain, and it was as though a hundred-plus meteors of rain were
pummeling into the Direwolf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smash! Smash! Smash!
Smash! Smash! Smash! The hundred-plus meteors of rain smashed
downwards, every single drop containing awe-inspiring power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Outside
the formation, the azure-robed Bu Ying leapt to his feet, his eyes
filled with astonishment. “How could he have…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single drop of
rainwater contained awesome power. Rumble…the unceasingly
destructive strikes actually completely smashed apart that baleful,
heaven-menacing Direwolf, and it also blasted apart those seven
flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
Bladask, who was seated on the stone pillar, controlling everything,
had a completely different look on his face now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
Immediately after disintegrating the Direwolf phantom, several flying
swords continued to charge forward, not weakening in the slightest.
Howling through the air, they instantly struck against the body of
that Polaris Golem. BANG! They slashed straight through it, and the
black, rocky exterior of the Polaris Golem was instantly split open,
revealing the fiery red body of the golem within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
distant, white-robe elder immediately called out in a high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Bladask, his
face instantly turned completely ashen.
</P>

Chapter 32 - Shock and Awe (part 2)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lost. I lost. How
could…” Bloodrinker Bladask sat there atop the stone dais, his
face ashen. He couldn’t believe what had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Immortal
cultivators engaged in a battle, life and death was separated by a
hair. If they lost a single exchange, they could die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used a golem. I
also used a golem.” Bladask simply couldn’t accept this. “The
two golems have identical elemental ki cores, and the same amount of
elemental ki. It is an extremely fair situation; what we compete in
is our comprehension of the Dao, our sword arts, and other skills.
How could his sword arts actually be even more powerful than mine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he have known
that Ning had actually reached the Dao Domain level long ago? The Dao
Domain level was, normally speaking, the level which Primal Daoists
were at. But of course, at the Black-White College, everyone was a
supreme genius, and so there were many powerful Wanxiang Adepts who
were at the Dao Domain level. Bladask, however, was still a hair away
from being able to reach the Dao Domain level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through his swordplay,
he could just barely touch the Dao Domain level. This was much like
how, when Ning was young, when executing the [Raindrop Sword], he was
able to unleash the power of being ‘one with the world’ with his
sword attacks, even though he himself had not yet reached that level.
This was one of the strengths of possessing powerful sword arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
comprehension, Ning was at a higher level. In terms of sword arts,
after having been doubly baptized by the Stellar Hall of the
underwater estate and the Black-White Diagram, and after having
meditated on the [Lesser Five Elements Sword], Ning’s sword arts
had reached a limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of soul, Ning
was at the ‘divine sense’ level. Even amongst the Wanxiang Adepts
of the Black-White College, only those reincarnated Immortals, so few
they could be counted on one hand, were comparable to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In every single field,
he was inferior. How could he not have lost?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bladask, I was lucky enough to win by one stroke.”
Ning rose to his feet with a laugh, and the grand sealing formation
around them disappeared. With a tap of his feet, Ning flew out of the
arena, landing in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bladask had an ugly
look on his face. He flew out of the arena as well. He walked
straight towards Ning, and with a wave of his hand, produced two jade
bottles which he tossed to Ning. “A hundred black-white pellets and
fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Take it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally
stretched his hand out to accept them. “Hmph. Ji Ning.” Bladask
stared at Ning, his eyes filled with a desire for battle. “No
wonder Immortal Diancai accepted you as his disciple. I have nothing
to say about my defeat. Next time, however…I will challenge you
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will wait for
you.” Ning laughed. If someone wanted to deliver more black-white
pellets and liquefied elemental essence to him, why would he refuse?
“Hmph.” Bladask immediately walked towards Bu Ying. “Senior
apprentice-brother Ying!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed man, Bu
Ying, gave him a glance. “Don’t worry. Leave it to me.” This
time, it was Ying who had set up and arranged for the new disciples
to be taught a lesson, and he had also been the one to personally
invite Bladask over. Clearly, now that Bladask had lost, no matter
what, he, Bu Ying, couldn’t just let Ning leave victoriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Ying’s gaze fell
towards his fellow disciples nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth’s power truly cannot be
underestimated.” This geniuses all had looks of caution in their
eyes. From watching Ning’s attacks just now, they sensed that
Ning’s power was definitely not lower than theirs. Without a
certain degree of confidence, they naturally wouldn’t be willing to
proceed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ying, you are the only person who can succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, senior
apprentice-brother Ying, you have also trained in the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword], and the time you have spent training in it is
longer. Your chances of winning are greater.” Everyone was saying
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Ying cursed to
himself. So what if he trained in it for longer? Training in sword
arts wasn’t a matter of time; it was a matter of how much one
understood regarding the Dao. An Immortal training in the [Lesser
Five Elements Sword] for the first time would, in half a day, train
to an extremely high level in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ying also knew…that
since he was the instigator of this event, no matter what, he had to
get involved. One had to be able to bear responsibility for one’s
actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had immediately
won with his attack; this had caused Mu Northson to be incomparably
excited. “Well fought! Let those old disciples know that they can’t
just teach lessons to every new disciple as they please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Winning
was quite enjoyable. In addition, a hundred black-white pellets and
fifty kilograms of liquefied elemental essence was his, just like
that. Previously, when he had advanced from the early Zifu level to
the peak Zifu level, he had used less than forty kilograms of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth.” Bu Ying emerged from the group of
old disciples. “Senior apprentice-brother Ying,” Ning responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, your power truly is formidable. I
didn’t expect that shortly after joining our school, you would have
already reached such a level in your understanding of the [Lesser
Five Elements Sword]. I imagine that your insights into the Dao are
at a very high level,” Bu Ying said..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that his
opponent wanted to gain some intelligence about him. He immediately
laughed and said, “I just gained some initial insights into it, and
have much to learn.” Bu Ying laughed loudly. “You are being too
modest, junior apprentice-brother. I, your senior apprentice-brother,
also train in the [Lesser Five Elements Sword]. As I watched you
execute your sword arts…I couldn’t help but feel my hands itch.
What say you and I spar for a bit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, this is what I
wish for as well!” Ning immediately said. Someone was delivering
more gifts to him? Why wouldn’t he want it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on Ning’s
calculations, especially given how strong his soul was, he felt that
he should hold a major advantage over the other. There were probably
not many Zifu Disciples who could match him, unless a reincarnated
Immortal emerged to battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the wager?”
Ning asked. Bu Ying laughed. “Naturally, just a hundred black-white
pellets and five kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Overly
large wagers will hurt the camaraderie amongst us fellow disciples.”
Ning nodded. “Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later. Ning and
Bu Ying were each seated in the lotus position atop their stone
pillars. “Begin,” the white-haired elder barked. Instantly, the
grand sealing formation once again appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The golem which I
have chosen is known as the Six Harmonies Golem.” Senior
apprentice-brother Ying’s voice rang out. “Be careful, junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother. Please proceed.” Ning’s voice rang out as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sat on opposing
stone pillars, staring at each other. The two golems below stared at
each other as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Previously,
Bu Ying had a smiling look on his face, but his face now turned
solemn as he let out a low growl. Instantly, the Six Harmonies Golem
simultaneously shot out thirty-six flying swords, every single one of
them covered with unique runes. The reason why this golem was named
the Six Harmonies Golem was precisely because it was capable of
executing this ‘Six Harmonies Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this,
frowned. “Go!” Twelve flying swords emerged from the back of the
Thousandswords Golem. These twelve flying swords hissed as they
slashed through the air, transforming into a dense layer of rain,
each containing inexhaustible amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six flying
swords swiveled as they flew, six of each forming into a formation
base, with the six bases forming the Six Harmonies Formation. In
addition, the entire formation transformed into a giant windmill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
power of it crushed downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crash crash crash….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless droplets
of rain smashed viciously against that giant windmill, but the
thirty-six flying swords of the windmill swiveled about, easily
dissipating the smashing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t block it.
This Bu Ying truly is much more formidable than Bladask; fortunately,
I was prepared long ago.” Ning’s face changed, and a fierce look
flashed through his eyes. The twelve flying swords under his control
suddenly separated into two parts. One part spun in a circle in
midair, while the other formed a cross.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The twelve
flying swords merged with each other, transforming into an azure,
flaming sword. BOOM! The giant, azure flaming sword pierced directly
through the windmill. The windmill was only able to take it for a
brief moment before crumbling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Duality Azureflame
Sword]!” Bu Ying, seated there on the pillar, saw this. His face
turned ashen, and then he let out a sigh. He didn’t even try to
fight back, allowing Ning’s azure, flaming sword to pierce directly
through the protective layer of his golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
white-haired elder once more called out in a high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Debate Palace
was a hubbub of noise right now. Bu Ying was definitely an
outstanding figure amongst the Zifu Disciples of the Black-White
College, and could be considered one of the movers and shakers. In
terms of power, he was far superior to Bladask. And yet, even he had
been defeated by this new disciple who had just joined the
Black-White College?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all supreme
geniuses…but this Ji Ning is an absolute monster.” Ninelotus
watched everything happen, and she murmured in her heart, “He
reached the Dao Domain level at merely sixteen years of age? And his
soul has supposedly reached the divine sense level…he’s
absolutely a monster, like those reincarnated Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To lose to a monster
like him…their defeats are nothing to be ashamed of.”

Chapter 33 - Two Major Factions
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a thought, Ning
removed his binding from the Thousandswords Golem, then leapt three
hundred meters and landed outside the battle arena. He secretly
sighed to himself, “Although I have reached the Dao Domain level,
and my soul is at the ‘divine sense’ level…if I hadn’t
meditated on the [Lesser Five Elements Sword] and increased the power
of my sword arts, it would be hard to say if I would have won, or
this Bu Ying would have won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His foundations were
exceptionally stable, at the level of a reincarnated Immortal.
However, prior to joining the Black-White College, his sword arts had
been very weak; only after learning the [Lesser Five Elements Sword]
had he been able to address this shortcoming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t learned
it, he would have had to rely on the power of his soul and controlled
even more flying swords to achieve victory through numbers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Bu Ying landed
next to Ning as well. “Senior apprentice-brother Bu Ying,” Ning
greeted him modestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bu Ying sighed. “No
wonder Immortal Diancai accepted you as his disciple, junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth. I whole-heartedly acknowledge my loss.
You were able to simultaneously control twelve flying swords and
execute the ‘Drizzling Rain’ technique. Your level of insight is
very high, and your soul is powerful; all of these things inspire
admiration in me. In addition, junior apprentice-brother, you were
even able to execute the [Duality Azureflame Sword]…I have nothing
to say about my loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are a hundred
black-white pellets and five kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence.” Bu Ying tossed two bottles to Ning, who accepted them.
“However, junior apprentice-brother, you’ve now defeated both
Bladask and myself.” Bu Ying looked towards Ning. “Make your
preparations. This matter will not conclude here.” After speaking,
Bu Ying began to walk towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t conclude
here?” Ning frowned, then followed him outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
Northson excitedly ran over. It was as though he was even more
excited than Ning by Ning’s victory. “That was too incredible.
And to think those old disciples wanted to teach us new disciples a
lesson. Hahaha! They’ve lost two rounds in a row now. This time,
the old disciples really did lose face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “It was
nothing more than a spar.” Northson disagreed. “No, this was
about face. This year, there are only two new disciples, you and me.
Now that you’ve won, senior apprentice-brother, as your junior
apprentice-brother, I’ve gained face as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While chatting, the two
moved to the outside. As for the old disciples, none of them,
including Bu Ying, Winterain, and Bladask, moved to speak to Ning.
The atmosphere was clearly rather awkward. The only person to move
closer to him was Ninelotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning felt his heart clench. Ninelotus truly was
a naturally mesmerizing figure. In terms of appearance, she could be
described as a peerless beauty; of all the beauties Ning had ever
seen, she was second only to Meng Xin. But in terms of grace and
aura, she was unquestionably number one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Ninelotus’ voice was very soft and
gentle. “You must be careful. You won two rounds in a row. The old
disciples won’t just let things slide like this. No matter what,
the traditions of our Black-White College will not be broken just for
you. When you go back, you need to make your preparations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pupils
contracted slightly. He nodded. “I, Ji Ning, have always looked
forward to the opportunity to spar with my fellow disciples.”
Ninelotus nodded as well, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
other old disciples. However, given that even Bu Ying had been
defeated, none of the others felt any confidence in being able to
win, and so they naturally didn’t say a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
immediately led Northson away, and the two left the Dao Debate
Palace. Swoosh! The two quickly disappeared into the night sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They watched as Ning
and Northson left. Only now did the old disciples within the Dao
Debate Palace begin to speak amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We actually lost two
battles in a row!” A tall, skinny youth said in a hoarse voice, “We
old disciples are meant to teach a lesson to the newer disciples, to
let them understand the principle that there is a heaven beyond the
heavens, and geniuses beyond geniuses. This is a tradition of our
Black-White College that has lasted for countless years! All of us
are old disciples who joined years ago. No matter what, we can’t
just admit defeat like this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. If we admit
defeat, then that means that we old disciples are admitting
inferiority to the newer disciples.” Even Winterain nodded as well.
The old disciples all nodded. This was a tradition!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old disciples were
to teach the new disciples a lesson. These old disciples had joined
many years ago, and although some of the weaker ones amongst them
would occasionally lose to a new disciple, the stronger ones amongst
the old disciples would gain a victory back in turn! If they weren’t
able to do so…didn’t that mean that every single one of them was
inferior to the new disciples?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From ancient times
to modern times, there has never been anyone capable of forcing the
old disciples of the Black-White College to admit defeat. Not even
reincarnated Immortals!” Bu Ying nodded solemnly as he spoke. “I
will go ask junior apprentice-brother Qinghe.” After speaking, Bu
Ying left the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” The
old disciples all departed from the Dao Debate Palace, transforming
into streaks of light and disappearing into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of the
Black-White College were divided into three generations. The third
generation consisted of Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang Adepts. Amongst
the Zifu Disciples…the most outstanding and dazzlingly strong one
was Qinghe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qinghe entered the
school at eighteen years of age, and had also reached the Dao Domain
level. Given his current level of insight, he could easily reach the
Wanxiang Adept level, but he needed to further solidify his
foundation. Only with a sufficiently stable foundation would the Zifu
Lake within his body truly expand to the limit, allowing his future
potential to be greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Qinghe, junior apprentice-brother Qinghe.” Bu
Ying charged into the skies above a towering mountain, then
immediately began to shout, his voice echoing within the entire
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciple
retainers and the commoner servants in the estate below all began to
react.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bu Ying, why have you come to speak to me so late
at night?” A figure suddenly emerged from the courtyard, head
upraised and staring towards Bu Ying, who stood there in the night
sky. Bu Ying immediately landed within the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come here
this late at night to inform you about something, junior
apprentice-brother.” Bu Ying shook his head and sighed. “I’m
ashamed to even say this. Each year, the new disciples of our
Black-White College will go to the Dao Debate Palace and be taught a
lesson by us old disciples. In the past, the two of us experienced
this as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qinghe laughed and
nodded. “Right. The old disciples have all been in the school for
many years. Naturally, they will win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Except, we lost.”
Bu Ying shook his head. “Just now, several of us old disciples were
at the Dao Debate Palace, sparring with the new disciples, Ji Ning
and Mu Northson. We defeated Northson twice in a row…but
afterwards, when we sparred with Ji Ning, we were defeated by him
twice in a row. In fact, even I lost to the hands of junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Qinghe was
shocked. “Senior apprentice-brother, you lost?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That’s why
I came to invite you,” Bu Ying said. “You can be said to be the
Zifu Disciple amongst us who is at the very peak of power, and so…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qinghe nodded. “Senior
apprentice-brother, don’t worry. Naturally, I won’t shirk my
duties in this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, senior apprentice-sister.” Ninelotus stood there
in midair, staring down towards a graceful estate below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister, you
came?” A clear, cold voice rang out. “Why don’t you come in?”
Ninelotus immediately landed. There was a black-robed maiden standing
there, beneath the moonlight. In front of her there was an
exquisitely carved wine flask and wine goblets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This maiden’s
beautiful features were absolutely superior to that of even
Ninelotus…and that cool, indifferent aura made her seem like a true
Immortal of the heavens. And, in truth, this black-robed maiden was
indeed a reincarnated Immortal. Within the Black-White College, she
was an extremely famous reincarnated Immortal, the Rainbowflame
Fairy, Yu Wei! As one of the extremely few reincarnated Immortals,
although she was currently only at the peak Wanxiang Adept level, her
status was comparable to that of the Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ninelotus sat down as well. “Are you aware
that amongst the new disciples, there is one who is apparently a
reincarnated Immortal as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you referring to
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning?” The black-robed maiden sat
down, then nodded gently. “I heard that Immortal Diancai chose him
as his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus immediately
said, “Senior apprentice-sister, you don’t know this, but even
before joining the school, Ji Ning has already reached the Dao Domain
level, and his soul has supposedly even reached the ‘divine sense’
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His soul has
supposedly reached the ‘divine sense’ level?” The black-robed
maiden was rather surprised. Ninelotus nodded. “This is what my
master told me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Fivecraze?”
The black-robed maiden nodded gently. “Intriguing. I didn’t
expect that one of the new disciples would be such an impressive
figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus continued,
“And just now, at the Dao Debate Palace, this Ji Ning consecutively
defeated two of the old disciples. I trust that once this information
spreads out, the old disciples definitely won’t let this matter
rest. No matter what, they will have to win it back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Win. Yes, it
will be necessary to win a match back.” The black-robed maiden
nodded, then smiled. “But if he really is a reincarnated Immortal,
given his current level of insight, he might even have some of his
former memories from his past life. If you aren’t careful, his
power might suddenly explosively increase. Defeating a reincarnated
Immortal won’t be an easy matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus glanced at
this senior apprentice-sister of hers, this Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu
Wei. Of course reincarnated Immortals were terrifyingly strong. All
of them had astonishing levels of talent, and when they started to
train, they increased in power at a shocking rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning is only
sixteen,” Ninelotus said. The black-robed maiden laughed. “If he
hasn’t awakened any of his former memories, beating him shouldn’t
be too hard. When are they going to go challenge him? I will go and
take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be
tomorrow,” Ninelotus said. “Fine. I’ll definitely go.” Yu Wei
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanxiang Adept
Northmont Blackcurrent frowned. “Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji Ning. He
consecutively defeated two of the old disciples. Even Bu Ying was
beaten by him.” A black-robed youth sat there, chatting leisurely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackcurrent laughed.
“I didn’t expect that the Ji Ning who Northmont Baiwei befriended
is actually as powerful as this. I previously misjudged him. Since he
is going to be challenged tomorrow, I’ll go and take a look as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning? I heard
that in the Carefree Caverns, he unleashed a Rainwater Sword Domain.
Clearly, he’s already reached the Dao Domain level, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Dao Domain
level? No wonder he is this powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The new disciple,
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, defeated two of the old disciples?
How can we accept this? No matter what, we have to win a match back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One told ten, and ten
told a hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
disciples in the Black-White College to begin with, and most of them
had known each other for many years and were on quite good terms with
each other. As they exchanged this news amongst each other…by the
second day, this news had already spread throughout the entire
Black-White College. In fact, even some of the well-connected major
powers within Stillwater Commandery, such as the Northmont clan, had
received word of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, the other
disciples all felt that, no matter what, they had to win a match
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of the
entire Black-White College had naturally divided into two major
factions. The first was the new disciples faction; this consisted of
just Ji Ning and Northson. The second was the old disciples faction;
that consisted of all of the other disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, did you just say that this disciple of mine
consecutively defeated two of the old disciples?” The black-robed,
black-haired Immortal Diancai had a hint of curiosity in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Virtually all
of the third-generation disciples are going to the Dao Debate Palace.
They definitely want to win a match back..” The short elder,
dressed in ragged beggar’s clothes, said with excitement, “Hahaha,
it’s been a long time since something so amusing has happened
within our Black-White College. Myself, an ole madman, just survived
the ninth-century tribulation, and now I’ve encountered this.
Intriguing, intriguing. When the time comes, I’ll definitely go
watch. Are you going?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
gently, then laughed, “Since you are going, senior
apprentice-brother, as your junior apprentice-brother, I’ll
naturally accompany you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha. Great,
great, great. Intriguing, intriguing.” The short elder, Immortal
Fivecraze, suddenly waved his hand. “Now hurry up and bring out
that Centiflower Immortal Wine and let your senior apprentice-brother
have a taste.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Centiflower Immortal
Wine? But I got that in one of the minor worlds…” Immortal
Diancai’s face turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder stared
at him. “I, your senior apprentice-brother, probably will only be
able to live another nine centuries. And you can’t even spare me
some wine? If you refuse to give me any wine to drink, then when Ji
Ning competes against the old disciples, I’ll play some underhanded
tricks in secret!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai let
out a long, helpless sigh. “Fine, I’ll give it to you!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 34 - Fated to be Master and Servant
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Watching
the sun rise in the east, Ning let out a soft breath. “Come, all of
you, come. I’ll take on all comers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had won two
consecutive battles last night. The parting words of senior
apprentice-brother Bu Ying and senior apprentice-sister Ninelotus
allowed Ning to understand…that no matter what, the old disciples
definitely wouldn’t just let things rest. They would have to win
one round of battle, no matter the cost. Ning had to admit; some of
the supremely talented disciples of the Black-White College would
definitely find it hard to admit inferiority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning wouldn’t
easily admit defeat either. If he had to lose, he had to be
thoroughly convinced of his defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to
defeat me, then you need to make me feel completely convinced of your
superior power.” Ning’s eyes were filled with a readiness for
battle. This entire night, he had been analyzing the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword]; since he knew that he had to engage in battles
tomorrow, he naturally had to seize every moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and a
flying boat appeared next to him. He prepared to go meet with his
master, Immortal Diancai…after all, there were many questions he
had encountered when analyzing the [Lesser Five Elements Sword].
Perhaps by asking his master, he would have some of his questions
resolved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The flying boat
instantly disappeared into the skies. But suddenly, a voice rang out.
“Senior apprentice-brother Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, atop the boat,
turned to look. A middle-aged man, mounted on a sword, was flying
towards him. A hint of nervousness and awe was on his face, and the
borders of his sleeves were decorated with white and black
embroidery. Upon seeing the embroidery, Ning immediately understood
that this should be a formal disciple’s retainer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single formal
disciple was able to take on ten retainers. These Immortal
practitioner retainers would carry out some some important tasks,
deliver messages, stand as guards, etc. These were the tasks they
would carry out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
looked towards him. The middle-aged man replied respectfully, “There
is someone outside the College who wishes to see you, senior
apprentice-brother Darknorth. He calls himself Northmont Baiwei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Baiwei?”
Ning nodded. “I’ll head right over.” Swoosh! He immediately
directed the boat towards the Black-White College’s main gate.
Moments later, he arrived and saw that outside the gate, Baiwei was
seated atop his Ninestar Immortal Carriage in an extremely
ostentatious manner, with the driver still that female servant
construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Baiwei,
upon seeing Ning fly over aboard his boat, immediately disembarked
from the carriage. “Baiwei.” Ning landed. “Why have you come so
early this morning to the College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei laughed, then
pointed towards three people standing nearby. All of them had fairly
exceptional auras. “I told you before that I wanted five slots from
you. These three will fill up three of the slots. As for the other
two…they’ll arrive after a period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of them?”
Ning sized them up carefully. Every single formal disciple could only
have ten retainers. Once a master-servant relationship was
established, they would generally be together for a century, or even
centuries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three are all
not bad.” Baiwei pointed to the tallest one, a rather skinny youth.
“His name is Cloudship. He’s a member of the Cloud tribe, and an
early stage Zifu Disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudship’s eyes were
very bright. He immediately said with respect, “Cloudship pays his
respects to senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Cloudship’s
little sister.” Baiwei pointed to a devilishly beautiful, tall,
willowy woman who was dressed in white muslin. This woman’s eyes
were extremely large, soft, and moist. Her eyes were just as bright
as her older brother’s. She gave Ning a deep look, then curtsied
and said, “Cloudjade pays her respects to senior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei then pointed to
the final person, a seemingly ordinary youth. “His name is Forgard.
He was originally one of my guards, and is extremely loyal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgard pays his
respects to senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” The
ordinary-looking youth also bowed with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudship,
Cloudjade, and Forgard.” Baiwei laughed. “They will be your
retainers, Brother Ji Ning. If they treat you with any disrespect at
all, you can immediately expel them from the Black-White College. As
for myself, Northmont Baiwei, I’ll never meet them again after
that. In dealing with them, you do not need to consider the question
of giving me face at all.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are another
hundred ordinary mortals. They were all carefully selected, and all
have some special talents. They are skilled in calligraphy, painting,
cooking, and the likes.” Baiwei pointed towards a group of ordinary
mortals. These were almost all women, with only two or three dozen
being men.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Baiwei pointed
towards them, they all fell to their knees in respect, not daring to
show the slightest hint of discourtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble, Brother Baiwei.” Ning nodded. Baiwei asked, “If you
aren’t in a hurry, how about, in a few days, you, me, and that Mu
Northson have a little get together?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Ning
hurriedly added, “Right. There’s something I need to trouble you
about, Brother Baiwei.” “Oh? Pray tell,” Baiwei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Here’s
the situation. When travelling to Stillwater City, I encountered
three early stage Zifu Disciples of the Meng clan. Their names were
Meng Xin, Meng Roch, and Meng Jun. Afterwards, they met with one of
their seniors of their clan, someone they addressed as ‘Uncle
Ming’, a balding, middle-aged man.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the three of
them, Meng Roch once used a forbidden technique and harmed his
foundations. I imagine that it will be hard for him to enter a
school, and so I want to give one of the retainer positions to him.
Only, I have no idea where he is living, so I’d like to ask you to
help investigate, Brother Baiwei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a minor
matter,” Baiwei said with confidence. “The Meng clan is a major
clan. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain will definitely be keeping
track of the movements of the members of their clan. I’ll go
investigate and will immediately find out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, if there’s
nothing else, I won’t tarry.” Baiwei once more walked to his
Ninestar Immortal Carriage. The two clasped hands towards each other,
bidding each other farewell, and then the Immortal Carriage
transformed into a blaze of light, disappearing into the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning made his flying boat increase in size, to a ship that was many
tens of meters in length. “All of you, come aboard.” The three
retainers and the many mortal followers all boarded the ship, and
then the ship soared into the skies, flying at high speed towards
Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei, riding within
the Ninestar Immortal Carriage, quickly arrived at the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the new
disciple of the Black-White College, Ji Ning, defeated two of the old
disciples in a row last night!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of a
person is this Ji Ning? He is that amazing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea. All I heard
is that he was accepted by Immortal Diancai as his apprentice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he left the
carriage, Baiwei overheard two Immortal practitioners engaged in a
conversation. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain was a place where fish
and dragons intermingled; there was quite the free flow of
information here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” A hint of a
smile appeared on Baiwei’s face. “My brother Ji Ning actually did
something so incredible last night, and I didn’t even know about
it? Mm. First, I’ll help him locate that Meng Roch fellow. Since my
brother Ji Ning remembered him, I imagine that this Roch must have
some extraordinary qualities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">East Stillwater City.
Within an exquisite estate. Meng Roch was seated here, drinking wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister Xin,
let me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sister Xin,
I’ll help you package these.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun was quite the
busy bee right now, helping Meng Xin take care of and package some of
her household items. They had been living in their Third Uncle’s
residence in recent days, but since they had entered a school, the
school had given them three days time to prepare. Then, they would
leave Stillwater City and head to the headquarters of the main sect,
located a million kilometers away from Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meng Jun glanced
sideways at Meng Roch, who was drinking wine gloomily, then sighed,
“Rocky, just endure it for a bit. In a few more years, when your
injuries can no longer be detected, you’ll be able to join a school
as well. I must say though, it seems as though karma has bound myself
and Little Sister Xin together. We actually ended up in the same
school by coincidence. Haha, what luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still drinking wine,
Roch’s face sank, and he crushed the beastskull goblet in his hand
to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Jun let out
a snort, then turned his head and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despicable fellow.”
Roch gave him a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, he was able
to guess that Jun had been following after Xin…and so, when Xin had
entered a school, Jun had chosen that same school. Xin and Jun were
equally talented, and so it wasn’t strange for them to both join
the same school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch had been
infatuated with Xin since he was young, but the same was true for
Jun! This made Roch feel all the more miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despicable fellow!”
Roch ground his teeth. “I hate the fact that I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Brother Rocky.”
Xin stood there next to him. Roch raised his head, looking towards
her. “Don’t give up. I believe that you will definitely succeed.”
Xin’s eyes were slightly red. Roch instantly felt a warm feeling in
his heart, and he nodded strongly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Succeed? Hmph.”
From nearby, a strange, bizarre sounding snort could be heard.
“Little Sister Xin, let’s go. We should go to our Thousand Rivers
School.” Xin gave Roch a deep look, but in the end, she had to
leave. She had to go to the main sect. Had to embark on her Immortal
path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roch silently watched
as she left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Xin. Wait for
me,” Roch silently said to himself. However, the fact that he had
been kicked out by various schools for three days in a row made Roch
feel all the more miserable and frantic in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Black-White
College. Ning was carefully observing Cloudship, Cloudjade, and
Forgard. Although Baiwei had brought them here, if Ning truly
disliked them, he could still kick them out. After all, masters and
retainers would be together for a very long period of time. As for
Cloudship, Cloudjade, and Forgard, they were rather nervous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Forgard was
originally a guard? And is quite loyal?” Ning had immediately felt
well-disposed towards Forgard. “Cloudship, upon seeing me,
immediately smiled; he knows how to flatter. As for his little
sister, Cloudjade…what the hell was Baiwei thinking? Why’d he
deliver such an alluring girl to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade definitely
could be considered an alluring girl. In terms of appearance alone,
she was not even inferior to Meng Xin, and more attractive than even
Ninelotus. In addition, her entire body seemed to naturally exude a
certain magnetism, and her soft, moist eyes were extremely seductive
as well. It seemed as though ever since she had seen Ning, she was
either consciously or unconsciously attempting to seduce him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgard. Why do you
have a name like this?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forgard said solemnly,
“Originally, I had no name. Afterwards, I was given a name by the
young master and served him for many years. Perhaps the young master
felt that I would have great future accomplishments, and so he gave
me this life-changing chance. And thus, he also gave me a Daoist
title, ‘Forgard’; he wished for me to forget that I was once a
guard, and wished for me to truly become a formidable Immortal
practitioner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The ship
descended towards Darknorth Peak. The nearby Cloudship, Cloudjade,
and Forgard all nervously awaited Ning’s questions…but
unexpectedly, Ning didn’t ask them a single thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Upon
landing, Ning spoke out, and the Whitewater Hound immediately
appeared. Ning glanced towards the three retainers and many
commoners, then said in a clear voice, “All of you, listen up. This
is Darknorth Peak, of the Black-White College. Here in my Darknorth
Peak…you must always obey the words of my Uncle White. Whatever
Uncle White tells you to do, you do. You must never disobey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Cloudship,
Cloudjade, Forgard, and the crowd of commoners all assented
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, those
three are retainers, while the rest are all ordinary mortals.” Ning
looked towards the Whitewater Hound. “I’ll hand full
responsibility for all matters in Darknorth Peak to you, Uncle White.
Give them their instructions and tell them about the rules here at
the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
immediately transformed into mist, and when he reformed, he appeared
as a white-robed, white-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed,
white-haired man had a very gentle look in his eyes, and he seemed to
extrude a natural aura of friendliness, as though he brought the
gentle, warm spring wind with him. He laughed and said, “Ning, son,
go ahead and leave these things to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately transformed into a ray of light, quickly departing from
Darknorth Peak. As for the others, including the retainers, they were
restricted as to where in the Black-White College they could go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning arrived before the mountain peak which was the residence of his
master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Enter.” A
calm voice rang out by Ning’s ears. “Yes, Master.” Ning
immediately descended towards the peak.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_35___Immortal_Diancai_s"></A>
Chapter 35 - Immortal Diancai’s Guidance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no one within
the hall, only the black-haired, black-robed Immortal Diancai. The
Immortal was seated in the lotus position atop his jade bed. Ning
stepped into the room, then immediately bowed with respect. “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
slightly. He looked at Ning, a hint of amusement visible on his face.
“Ji Ning, I heard that yesterday, you defeated two of your senior
apprentice-brothers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said.
“Only, I’m afraid my fellow disciples won’t let the matter
rest. Today, they will probably come challenge me again. Thus, I have
come to you, Master, in the hope that you can provide me with some
guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. At least you are
grounded. You didn’t grow arrogant just because you defeated two
Zifu Disciples.” Immortal Diancai nodded. “Everyone who has been
accepted to the Black-White College is a supreme genius. The third
generation is primarily divided into Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang
Adepts.” Ning listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Black-White
College has more than a hundred Zifu Disciples, and more than two
hundred Wanxiang Adepts. Why?” Immortal Diancai continued, “These
disciples are all at fairly high levels of comprehension; if they
wanted to enter the Wanxiang Adept level, I imagine that all of them
would be able to do so. The reason why there are still a hundred-plus
Zifu Disciples is for several reasons; firsts of all, they want to
solidify their bases of power and prepare an ‘Immortal foundation’.
The second is because they wish to increase their level of insight
and comprehension; that way, when they encounter the Three Calamities
and Nine Tribulations, they will naturally have a greater chance of
surviving them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Three
Calamities, Nine Tribulations…as an Immortal practitioner, Ning
naturally knew of them. The power of these trials was something that
was related to time; the more time passed, the more powerful they
would become. In addition, they were also related to one’s karmic
merits or sins. The greater the sin, the more difficult the
tribulation. Finally, they were also related to one’s level of
power. If they had trained for the same period of time, the
tribulation for a Primal Daoist would be more dangerous than the
tribulation for a Wanxiang Adept….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were many other variables. It was difficult to predict the power of
the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, and in the end, it was
the guillotine held over the necks of all Immortal practitioners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there was one
commonality: Strengthen one’s level of comprehension! Strengthen
one’s soul! Strengthen one’s Dao-heart! The more stable one’s
foundation was, the greater one’s chances at overcoming the
tribulations would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is precisely
because they wish to prepare for the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations, and because they wish to establish a foundation to
become a Celestial Immortal, that none of them are in a hurry to make
their breakthrough,” Immortal Diancai explained. “Generally
speaking, new disciples will remain at the Zifu stage for ten or so
years. But of course, those who are slightly weaker in terms of
comprehension might stay at that level for fifty or sixty years. As
for the extremely talented ones, they’ll stay at that level for
half a year before making their breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is why the
Wanxiang Disciples represent the true elites of the third
generation.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. Ning nodded. He
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Wanxiang Adepts
of our Black-White College are different from the Wanxiang Adepts of
other schools. They are true geniuses amongst Wanxiang Adepts!”
Immortal Diancai said. “For other schools, every so often, they
might have one or two Wanxiang Adepts who reach the ‘Dao Domain’
level…but for our Black-White College, almost every single Wanxiang
Adept is at the Dao Domain level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning felt
shock in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some who
are even more formidable. They have an incredibly deep comprehension
of their chosen Dao, and perhaps even many insights into other Daos
as well. They are able to reach the ‘Dao Domain’ level in
multiple, different Daos!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some who
are even more monstrous. While at the Wanxiang Adept level, they have
completely understand an entire ‘Dao Path’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning’s
face instantly changed. A complete Dao Path?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other schools,
generally speaking, only Immortals will comprehend an entire,
complete Dao Path. But in our Black-White College, every single
Primal Daoist has comprehended an entire Dao Path, and amongst the
Wanxiang Adepts, a few of the most talented, most monstrous of the
Adepts have comprehended an entire Dao Path as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, Ji Ning,
you have no need to feel embarrassed. These geniuses who were able to
comprehend an entire Dao Path? Two of them are reincarnated
Immortals, while the other three have been training for more than two
hundred years. They might break through to the Primal Daoist level at
any moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you stay at the
Black-White College for a bit longer, you’ll understand a few
things. One of them is this; our Black-White College has an unspoken
rule that only after one has comprehended a complete Dao Path will
one make a breakthrough to the Primal Daoist level.” Immortal
Diancai looked towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanxiang Adepts were
the true elites amongst the crowd. For example, Ning himself; once
his Zifu Lake expanded to the limit, he probably wouldn’t hesitate
at all and break through to the Wanxiang Adept level. Thus, those who
remained behind at the Zifu Disciple level were, generally speaking,
the average-to-below-average bunch amongst these supreme geniuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wanxiang Adepts can
be divided into three levels. The first level has only reached the
Dao Domain level. The second has reached the Dao Domain level in
multiple Daos. The third level has comprehended a complete Dao Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai looked
towards Ji Ning. “Don’t worry. This time, your fellow disciples
amongst the Wanxiang Adepts level won’t interfere too casually;
they’ll first have the most powerful Zifu Disciples make their
attempt. But if even they are unable to defeat you, only then will
the Wanxiang Adepts make their moves! No matter what, however, those
supreme few who have comprehended a complete Dao Path will not
interfere. If they did, that would be going a bit far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Master,
how many reincarnated Immortals are there amongst the Wanxiang
Adepts?” Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
laughed. “You disciples are always curious about the reincarnated
Immortals. Actually, it’s even possible that you yourself might be
a reincarnated Immortal. Amongst the Wanxiang Adepts, there are three
who have been verified to be reincarnated Immortals. Two of them
spent eighty years in training and have comprehended a complete Dao
Path, while the other one has trained for twenty or so years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After having heard
me say so many things, you should now understand the situation.”
Immortal Diancai sighed. “You’ve only defeated two of the Zifu
Disciples, and they aren’t even two of the strongest Zifu
Disciples, much less the Wanxiang Adepts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your student
understands,” Ning nodded. Immortal Diancai concluded, “Alright.
Time to display your sword arts to me. Show me everything without
holding back anything; you won’t be able to damage this hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
didn’t hesitate at all. He immediately executed his most powerful
sword attack…the [Tripartite Lotus Sword]. The Darknorth sword in
his hand shot out, and as it did, it divided into three colors. Lotus
flowers began to bloom with incomparable beauty, but within the
beauty, there was a sword light with astonishing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Tripartite
Lotus Sword]?” Immortal Diancai laughed. “The [Lesser Five
Elements Sword]. I, your master, have also studied the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword]. This sword attack you just displayed can be
considered to have a tenth of its grace and charm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A tenth?” Ning
blinked. “Just a tenth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai shook
his head. “What do you expect? The [Tripartite Lotus Sword] focuses
on it being ‘Tripartite’; it requires balance! Your comprehension
into these three Daos, however, clearly shows that your understanding
of the Dao of Rainwater is much stronger, while the other two are
much weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve only
developed your Rainwater Sword Domain. If you were to develop two
other Dao Domains, then at that point in time, you would be able to
display the true [Tripartite Lotus Sword],” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
acknowledgement. He had to admit, it was true that the [Tripartite
Lotus Sword] required balance. His comprehension into the various
Daos, however, was unbalanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your comprehension
of the Dao of Rainwater is stronger,” Immortal Diancai said. “Since
that’s the case, then I’ll help you retrofit your [Tripartite
Lotus Sword] into a [Neo-Tripartite Lotus Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
immediately waved out a sword-finger. Slash! A sword light instantly
flashed, and wherever it passed, flowers began to bloom. Only, the
green color within the flowerbuds was noticeably stronger, while the
other two colors served to accentuate it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four hours later,
Immortal Diancai’s guidance came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
explained as much as I can regarding the mysteries and secrets of the
[Neo-Tripartite Lotus Sword] and the [Three-Foot Sword]’s first
stance,” Immortal Diancai said. “Given your current level of
understanding, you should completely focus your attention on
analyzing these two sword arts. When the day comes where you are able
to release the power of both sword arts, come find me again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning bowed
with gratitude. The saying was true; listening to a master say a few
words was superior to training by one’s self for a year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Neo-Tripartite
Lotus Sword] was something which he had already begun to vaguely
grasp; most likely, he would soon be able to unleash its power. As
for unleashing the true power of the original [Tripartite Lotus
Sword], he would have to wait until he comprehended three Dao
Domains. When the three became one, he would be able to unleash the
most power possible from the [Tripartite Lotus Sword]. What he was
able to unleash right now was nothing more than some scraps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the first stance
of the [Three-Foot Sword], that was simply unfathomably profound. The
[Three-Foot Sword] focused more on the heart; training in the sword
was also training in the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
boarded his flying boat and departed from his master’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow hung
high in the sky. The Dao Debate Palace, atop the Dao Debate Peak.
Today, this place was incomparably lively. One streak of light after
another flew towards here, riding on flying swords, flying boats,
flying chains, flying gourds, flying red banners, flying leaves, and
all sorts of curious magic treasures. One after another, they flew
into the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Icezen, weren’t you wandering outside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just so happened
to be over at the Raindragon Guards’ place, and I heard that one of
our new disciples, Ji Ning, defeated two of his Zifu Disciple
colleagues in sequence. I’m quite curious, so I came over to take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few fellow
disciples have come today. It has been a long time since our
Black-White College has been so lively.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two figures chatted
amongst themselves as they flew to the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle arena was at
the heart of the Dao Debate Palace. At the sides of the arena were
many chairs. The higher-ranking disciples of the College sat down,
while the Zifu Disciples remained standing to the side, chatting
amongst themselves and in no rush to sit. After all, who knew how
many fellow disciples would come today?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Northmont Blackcurrent came as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Gatherform came as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Wanxiang Adept
after another arrived, all quite well-known. One high-ranking leader
after another arrived; naturally, these junior fellow disciples all
had blazing looks in their eyes. As latecomers, they naturally had
limited experience in adventuring in the outside world. But these
fellow disciples who had joined more than a century ago already had
shocking stories and legends about them that circulated in the
outside world. It was actually quite a frequent occurrence for the
Wanxiang Adepts of the Black-White College to be able to battle at a
higher level and combat even Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire came as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Dao Debate
Palace was now filled with disciples. All of them, Zifu Disciples or
Wanxiang Adepts, turned to look. A bald, barefoot, handsome youth who
was dressed in fiery red robes came walking in. His forehead had a
svastika symbol in the middle, and wherever he passed, it was as
though a sea of flame moved with him, as the temperature of the
surrounding area instantly skyrocketed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was an absolute
leader amongst the third generation disciples of the Black-White
College. Although he wasn’t a reincarnated Immortal, he had still
comprehended an entire, complete Dao Path. He could become a Primal
Daoist of the College at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire.” Blackcurrent was the first to draw
close to him.. “Blackcurrent.” Holyfire glanced at Blackcurrent,
then said calmly, “Has the new disciple, junior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning, arrived yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet. There was a
junior apprentice-brother who went quite some time ago to junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s Darknorth Peak, but he hasn’t come
yet,” Blackcurrent explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holyfire nodded, then
strode forward, taking a seat atop one of the centermost stone seats.
The fellow disciples seated around Holyfire were all formidable
figures within the College. For the likes of the Zifu Disciples, they
could only stare at him from afar; after all, they didn’t have a
relationship with him.

Chapter 36 - Junior Apprentice-Brother Ji Ning Welcomes All
Challengers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The winter wind was
quite refreshing. Ji Ning stood atop his boat, soaring through the
skies, and in his mind, he continued to think back to the scenes of
his master, Immortal Diancai, displaying sword arts for him to see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s sword
arts have truly reached an inconceivable level,” Ning sighed to
himself Diancai has often referred to as the ‘second coming of
Immortal Northwalker’, and also as the disciple of the Black-White
College with the greatest chances of becoming a Celestial Immortal.
Immortal Diancai’s sword arts vastly surpassed the level which Ning
was able to comprehend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm? Someone’s
here?” As his flying boat reached the air above Darknorth Peak,
Ning saw that there were currently two people standing outside the
gates to his estate. It was a white-robed Mu Northson and Winterain,
dressed in white cotton clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning landed on
the ground. “Master.” The ordinary mortals standing at the gate
immediately saluted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson, senior apprentice-sister Winterain, why
are you here?” After landing, Ning smiled towards them. Only now
did Winterain let out a long sigh of relief. “Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, can it be that you don’t know about
today’s matters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course Ning knew.
“Senior apprentice-sister Winterain, are you referring to the
challenges at the Dao Debate Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
Winterain nodded. “Today, many of our fellow disciples have hurried
over there. Even some of our fellow disciples who were not present in
the college, upon hearing this news, have hurried back. I’ve came
to invite you to the Dao Debate Palace, junior apprentice-brother
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Winterain
continued, “Let’s hurry. I imagine many of our fellow disciples
are growing impatient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
looked towards the nearby Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother
Northson, why didn’t you go to the Dao Debate Palace, and instead
came to find me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Need you ask?”
Northson stared. “The entire Black-White College only has two new
disciples; you and me. The two of us are on one side. All those
people at the Dao Debate Palace are older, more senior disciples. If
I go there, what am I supposed to do? Just stand there like an idiot
and be stared at by everyone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Let’s
go.” There was no way to back off now. If he backed off, he would
be looked down upon by everyone. He might as well openly go welcome
the challenges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The three rode
atop their respective magic treasures or construct, quickly
disappearing into the skies as three rays of light which sped towards
the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was rare for so many
fellow disciples to be gathered here at the Dao Debate Palace. Every
single one of the disciples present today could be described as truly
heroic figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why hasn’t that
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning arrived yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That young junior
apprentice-brother, Ji Ning…he wouldn’t be afraid, would he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fellow disciples
were all chatting in small groups amongst themselves as they waited.
It was, however, almost noon. Some of those who had come earlier had
been waiting for nearly four hours. Naturally, they were growing
rather impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…three
figures flew towards them from afar, then landed at the gates to the
Dao Debate Palace. This instantly attracted the attention of many of
their fellow disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s junior
apprentice-brothers Ji Ning and Northson. Next to them is junior
apprentice-sister Winterain.” Ji Ning and Northson had appeared at
the grand ceremony of initiation, after all; most of the people were
still able to recognize them with one glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, seated in the center, glanced at them
then said softly, “That fur-clad one is Ji Ning?” Northmont
Blackcurrent, seated next to him, immediately said hurriedly, “Right,
he is Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just from the look
in his eyes, I can tell that his Dao-heart is very resolute,”
Holyfire said softly. Blackcurrent replied, “If junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning knew that you were praising him like this,
senior apprentice-brother, I imagine he would be endlessly
overjoyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the Dao
Debate Palace, Ning went directly to the side room where he had
previously activated the Thousandswords golem, and then brought the
golem to return to the hall.. He stood there, in the hall, sweeping
everyone with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were familiar
figures, such as Ninelotus and the others. There were several figures
he didn’t recognize, but who the other fellow disciples surrounded;
clearly, these were extremely high-ranking figures of the College,
such as that bald, fiery-robed youth, that black-robed maiden, or
that sloppy-looking fat youth, or that large, muscular youth whose
entire body gleamed with magic treasures but whose skin was
jade-white…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those people being
surrounded by others are probably the most supreme members of the
third generation. They have probably either comprehended an entire
Dao Path or are reincarnated Immortals,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning leapt
forward like a streak of light, moving three hundred meters and
landing on a distant stone pillar. Staring at his surroundings, he
said in a clear voice, “My senior fellow disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the entire
Dao Debate Palace grew silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yesterday, I was
lucky enough to defeat two senior apprentice-brothers,” Ning said
in a high voice. “Thus, today I have come again. Any of my senior
fellow disciples who wishes to discuss the Dao with me can come up
and do so. As for the wager…I’ve recently joined the school, and
can’t afford too large a wager, and so we’ll just go with the
smallest wager of a hundred black-white pellets and five kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence. I will wait here. Anyone who wishes to
discourse on the Dao with me can come up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words concluded.
The entire Dao Debate Palace remained quiet for a moment of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That seemingly
sloppy-looking, pudgy youth who was surrounded by many others
laughed, his face covered with delight, as he looked towards Ji Ning,
who stood there in the distance atop the stone pillar. “This junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning really is straightforward and passionate.
I like him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sloppy-looking,
pudgy youth…was, awe-inspiringly enough, the undisputed number one
figure of the third generation of Black-White College disciples. In
the outside world, he was often referred to as the ‘Sloppy Daoist’,
but his actual Daoist title was ‘Threefat’. Although he was not a
reincarnated Immortal, Daoist Threefat was able to suppress the two
reincarnated Immortals in might, and so became known as the number
one figure amongst the third generation. One truly couldn’t judge
by looks alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hear that? Even
little Sloppy likes this Ji Ning.” In a corner of the Dao Debate
Palace, the similarly sloppy-looking short elder chortled. Next to
him, the black-haired, black-robed Immortal Diancai said resignedly,
“Senior apprentice-brother Fivecraze, why did we have to come here
to the Dao Debate Palace? We could’ve stayed in our own estate and
used a water-scrying technique; wouldn’t we still be able to see
everything going on here? Our apprentice-nephews such as the
headmaster are definitely all watching this in their own estates
through a water-scrying technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder glanced
sideways at Immortal Diancai. “When we watch here, we can also hear
the conversations going on between the third generation disciples.
That’s so much more fun. As for little Sloppy, he really is the
disciple I love the most; even his thoughts are identical to mine.
Don’t worry; we’ll watch here secretly, and those third
generation disciples won’t notice a thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Immortal
Diancai shook his head helplessly. This old fellow really was getting
crazier and crazier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Birds of a feather
flock together; ‘Sloppy’ had even given himself the Daoist title
‘Threefat’, and was incredibly sloppily dressed. Immortal Diancai
was an extremely strict person; naturally, he disliked this
tremendously. But there was nothing he could do…’Old Crazy’ was
the oldest of the Loose Immortals of the Black-White College, while
‘Young Crazy’ was the most talented disciple the Black-White
College had to offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope that I can
live to witness little Sloppy become an Earth Immortal. If I can
witness him become a Celestial Immortal, I’ll die with no regrets.”
The short elder suddenly turned somber and serious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother?” Immortal Diancai was startled. The short elder
stared at the fat, sloppy-looking youth who was surrounded by many
other disciples. “Just you wait and see. Little Sloppy will
definitely be more powerful than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai’s
gaze fell towards the distant stone pillar, and towards Ji Ning who
was seated atop it. This was the only disciple under his tutelage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about to
begin.” The short elder’s eyes lit up. “It’s the fellow
called Qinghe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very many
third generation disciples gathered here at the Dao Debate Palace.
The first to stand out was Qinghe, the man who was publicly
acknowledged as the strongest of the Zifu Disciple students.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. An azure-robed
figure moved forward like a blur, flying directly towards the distant
stone pillar before coming to a halt atop it. The golem he controlled
moved with him, landing on the arena below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” The azure-robed figure stared at the
distant Ning. “My name is Qinghe. I joined a few years before you
did, and would like to discuss the Dao with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin.” The
white-haired elder let out a loud shout, and the grand sealing
formation instantly covered the entire arena. Ning sat down calmly in
the lotus position, and senior apprentice-brother Qinghe did the
same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, junior
apprentice-brother. I am going to use a secret art which I discovered
when adventuring in the outside world; it is an art which a dying
senior left behind, which allows for the control of many flying
needles. This isn’t a technique which our school has records
about,” Qinghe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, feel free to use it,” Ning replied clearly. The
territory controlled by the Grand Xia Dynasty was too vast. Over the
course of countless years, there were quite a few legacies left
behind by Fiendgods or various major powers. As for legacies left
behind by senior Immortal cultivators…those were countless beyond
counting. Only, these relic sites also involved tremendous levels of
danger. Without having enough ability, one could not rashly enter
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch carefully.”
Qinghe appeared quite relaxed, but suddenly, his gaze sharpened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish swish
swish. Countless flying needles suddenly flew out of the body of the
golem below him. Those countless jade-green flying needles spun in
midair, resonating with each other and actually forming an enormous
green scorpion. This giant jade-green scorpion’s eyes were flashing
with a ferocious intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some reason, this
caused Ning to feel alarmed. “Not easy to deal with.” He had been
planning to once more use his [Duality Azureflame Sword], but he
instantly decided to use his current most powerful technique; the
[Neo-Tripartite Lotus Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t know
was that Qinghe, as the publicly acknowledged number one expert of
the Zifu Disciples, had a level of insight into the Dao that was
comparable to that of most Wanxiang Adepts already. He, too, had
reached the Dao Domain level. In terms of insight, he definitely was
not inferior to Ning. In addition, he had spent many years analyzing
this ‘Scorpic Godneedles’ technique. Given his power, if Ning
didn’t fight back at full strength, he would probably be crushed
instantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three swords suddenly
lit up. One transformed into a watery light, the second into a fiery
glow, and the third into an azure aura. The three flying swords
formed into a tripartite formation, and as they flew forward,
suddenly transformed into an enormous lotus flower, which had an
incomparably sharp and fierce sword light within the blossom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wins.” The
short elder in the corner of the Dao Debate Palace sighed. “This
sword art was born from the [Tripartite Lotus Sword], but is more
heavily focused towards the water-element of the Five Elements.
However, this power really is quite something! Ji Ning just entered
the College, and yet was already able to learn such a powerful
technique. He’s definitely not weaker than any ordinary Wanxiang
Adept disciples. Sword Immortals…they are famous for their combat
abilities. With the heart of a Sword Immortal and a sword art such as
this…if he encounters someone at the same level of insight, he will
win for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the short elder was
speaking, the sword light in the form of a lotus flower was clashing
repeatedly in midair against the giant, jade-green scorpion. With
each clash, a few of the needles would be knocked loose. After six
consecutive clashes, the giant, jade-green scorpion completely
shattered, transforming back into countless flying needles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash.” The
protective armor of the Godneedles Golem was pierced by that sword
light as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Dao Debate
Palace instantly fell silent. He had lost? The most powerful of the
Zifu Disciples, Qinghe, had actually lost? If even he had lost…could
it be that one of their senior apprentice-brothers at the Wanxiang
Adept level would enter the fray? For the sake of a new disciple,
they were going to have a Wanxiang Adept do battle?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins.” The
white-haired old man spoke out, and his voice echoed within the Dao
Debate Palace.
</P>

Chapter 37 - Two-Clawed Raindragon Guard
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the distant stone
pillar, Qinghe rose to his feet, then clasped his hands. “I lost. I
whole-heartedly acknowledge my defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning rose as well,
also clasping his hands, and then he swept the entire palace with his
gaze, looking towards each of his fellow disciples. In a clear voice,
he said, “Are there any other fellow disciples who wish to exchange
pointers with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed within
the entire palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Qinghe
shook his head, then leapt three hundred meters and landed next to
the white-haired elder. He took out two jade bottles, then placed
them in front of the elder. This was the wager he had lost. Turning
his head, he left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a period of time,
the Dao Debate Palace was silent. Nobody took up the challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even junior
apprentice-brother Qinghe lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Debates are
a competition of one’s comprehension of the Dao, as well as one’s
skills. It doesn’t have much to do with one’s elemental ki. Even
many of the Wanxiang Adepts amongst us are only on par with junior
apprentice-brother Qinghe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that only
those who have comprehended multiple Dao Domains are capable of
defeating junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course there were
people who could defeat Ning! In addition, there were quite a few.
For example, those three reincarnated Immortals who were at the
Wanxiang Adept level. Anyone who had comprehended a complete Dao Path
could effortless crush Ning. There were also a pile of disciples who
had comprehended multiple Dao Domains. But which one of them would
stand out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which of my senior
fellow disciples wishes to provide me with some guidance?” Ning
stood there atop the stone pillar, speaking in a clear voice. “If
no one else comes, then I shall retire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning
felt filled with a heroic aura. How joyous. He faced a group of
supreme geniuses, and he, a newly recruited disciple, was challenging
them. This really was a wonderful feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since my other
fellow disciples aren’t going to participate, then I’ll embarrass
myself by volunteering.” A clear, cold voice rang out and a
white-robed, white-haired youth strode forward. With a single step,
he transformed into a streak of light which entered the side room.
Soon, he returned with a golem by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow is skilled as a Fiendgod Body Refiner
and at close combat; he isn’t skilled in a golem-based Dao Debate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow is already a two-clawed Raindragon
Guard. In a real battle, he probably isn’t one whit inferior to an
ordinary Primal Daoist. But senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow’s
power primarily stems from his various divine abilities, his
Bloodforged weapons, as well as his Fiendgod Body Refining Technique,
the [Indestructible Bloodshadow Body]! In terms of controlling
golems, though, he’s a bit weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the white-robed,
white-haired youth appeared, a buzz of conversation swept the entire
palace. Ning’s ears twitched. He couldn’t help but feel secretly
surprised. What a tremendous background this senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow had. The Rites of
Bloodforging…although the likes of the Ji clan had never heard of
it, the Black-White College had. Only, one needed five hundred
black-white pellets to trade for the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And he’s actually
a two-clawed Raindragon Guard as well!” Ning was privately shocked.
After entering the Raindragon Guard, one would become an ordinary
one-clawed Raindragon Guard, and the Black-White College would reward
you with a thousand black-white pellets. If you became a two-clawed
Raindragon Guard, you would be rewarded with five thousand
black-white pellets. Upon becoming a three-clawed Raindragon Guard,
the reward would be increased to fifteen thousand black-white
pellets…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was very
difficult to become a two-clawed Raindragon Guard. Generally
speaking, only someone at the Primal Daoist level of power could
become one. Only a very few, exceptionally monstrous Wanxiang Adepts
were able to reach that level. As for that so-called ‘genius’ of
Snowdragon Mountain, Xue Hongyi, by comparison, he was far inferior
to this senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” The
white-haired, white-robed Bloodshadow’s body flickered, and he
appeared on the opposite stone pillar. “Junior apprentice-brother
Ji Ning.” Bloodshadow stared towards Ning. “I’m more used to
engaging in close combat. I’m not that skilled in controlling magic
treasures to attack. However, I’m still a bit stronger than junior
apprentice-brother Qinghe. You must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I await your
instructions, senior apprentice-brother,” Ning said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke. A
freak capable of becoming a two-clawed Raindragon Guard, even one who
was primarily a Fiendgod Body Refiner, definitely wouldn’t be weak
when controlling magic treasures. Fortunately, he would be doing so
through the golems…and so his divine body and divine abilities
would be of no use. Otherwise, there would be no need to compete at
all. Ning would simply admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!” The
white-haired elder called out in a high voice. Rumble…the grand
sealing barrier once more covered the entire arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position. Bloodshadow did the same. “Junior
apprentice-brother, be careful!” Bloodshadow called out in a cold
voice. Instantly, the strange flying swords on the back of the
Nineswords Golem began to fly out. Nine of the queer flying swords
flew through the air, beginning to emit a dense, bloody light. The
flying swords were all connected by the bloody light, and they
quickly formed into an enormous…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Something. It had
enormous cicada wings, a head with three horns, a mouth that was as
long and sharp as a blade, and a savage, flashing gaze. In fact, the
killing aura coming from this creature was even more terrifying than
that of the Direwolf which Bloodeater Bladask had summoned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mosquito?” Ning,
staring the beast that had appeared, couldn’t help but feel
astonished. This was a titanic mosquito.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! That
sinister-looking, baleful giant mosquito of blood suddenly charged
forward, howling through the air, its blade-mouth formed from one of
the flying swords. The power and invisible pressure from this
creature caused Ning’s heart to clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Neo-Tripartite
Lotus Sword]!” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately executing
his most powerful sword art. Instantly, three flying swords flew out
from the back of his Thousandswords Golem. They soon formed an
enormous, blooming lotus flower of sword light which stabbed directly
towards that baleful, heaven-defying mosquito of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The two
attacks were both as fast as lightning, and they instantly
crisscrossed in the sky. The blooming lotus flower’s sword-light
trembled, beginning to grow unstable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s going to
collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow is not skilled in using flying swords,
it isn’t too hard for him to suppress a young, newly recruited
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few fellow
apprentices nodded musingly to themselves. As for Northson, he
clenched his fists nervously as he watched, his heart filled with
worry. It was as though he himself wanted to personally charge up.
“You must win. You must win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” As soon
as he began fighting, Ning began to sense how terrifying the
penetrative power of the blood mosquito’s blade-mouth was. “Bang!”
The blood mosquito moved as fast as a shadow, quickly smashing yet
again against the lotus flower. Instantly, the blooming lotus flower
crumbled, and the three flying swords were scattered to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning had
expected this long ago. He had already prepared six more flying
swords, which shot out from the back of the Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go, go.” A
savage look was in Ning’s eyes. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Every three
flying swords formed a blooming lotus of sword-light, and even the
three original scattered swords once more reformed into a giant lotus
of sword-light. All of a sudden, the air was filled with three
enormous flashes of sword light, each of which bloomed into giant
loti. They flew out in a straight row, simultaneously striking
towards the blood mosquito. Meanwhile, Ning’s eyes were filled with
savagery as he controlled them in attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually able
to simultaneously unleash three of those [Tripartite Lotus Swords]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectating
disciples were all speechless. Using top-tier sword arts was
tremendously taxing on one’s mental faculties. For something like
the [Tripartite Lotus Sword]…most would be able to unleash just a
single one at most. To unleash three at the same time was rather
ridiculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the corner of the
Dao Debate Palace. Immortal Diancai nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He simultaneously
executed multiple sword arts.” The nearby short elder shook his
head repeatedly. “There’s only two possibilities. The first is
that his current comprehension of the Dao is far beyond the level of
this sword art, and so it is simplicity itself for him to use it;
only then can one simultaneously use multiple sword arts. The second
is that his soul is incomparably powerful, and so he can easily
withstand the pressure this sword art creates, allowing him to use it
multiple times simultaneously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Either one had a high
level of insight, or one had an extremely powerful soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple’s
soul…is at the divine sense level?” The short elder looked
towards Immortal Diancai, who nodded. “Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I thought,” the
short elder said softly. “If he has a ‘divine soul’ at the
divine sense level…I imagine he can execute two or three more
sword-lights. This battle…your disciple is probably going to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant blood
mosquito blurred, then transformed into three smaller blood
mosquitoes, simultaneously defending against the three [Tripartite
Lotus Swords].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
There, in midair, the three [Tripartite Lotus Swords] battled against
the three smaller blood mosquitoes. Everything was a blur as they
clashed and battled against each other repeatedly. Each side wanted
to break through the protective armor of the other’s golem, but
they also wanted to block the enemy attacks…for now, they were
battling to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go!” Ning’s
eyes were bloodshot, and the veins on his forehead were protruding.
Clearly, he was now going all out. Instantly, six more flying swords
flew out from the back of the Thousandswords Golem. The sky was soon
filled with two more [Tripartite Lotus Sword] attacks. A total of
five [Tripartite Lotus Swords] were surrounding and attacking the
blood mosquitoes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Seated in the
distance, Bloodshadow’s face changed. He immediately willed the
three blood mosquitoes to once more transform into a giant blood
mosquito. The cicada-like wings of the giant blood mosquito
fluttered, wrapping around that Nineswords Golem while the blade-beak
struck repeatedly against those [Tripartite Lotus Swords].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five
[Neo-Tripartite Lotus Swords] attacked wildly in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five [Tripartite
Lotus Swords]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectating
disciples were all rather stunned. They knew exactly how much stress
would be placed on the soul when one executed five powerful sword
arts simultaneously. To an ordinary person, dividing their mind to
carry out just two tasks simultaneously was already very difficult.
Dividing one’s mind to execute multiple supreme sword arts…and
five in total, at that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s comprehension must be at a very high
level, or his soul must be very strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He cannot be
underestimated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow is about to suffer from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one remains
perpetually on the defense, one will eventually lose. Under the
repeated strikes of Ning’s five [Neo-Tripartite Lotus Swords], in
the end, the blood mosquito wasn’t able to block an attack, and the
protective armor of the golem was breached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
white-haired elder called out in high voice. Only now did Ning
finally relax.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had actually
defeated a two-clawed Raindragon Guard! Although this Raindragon
Guard was more skilled as a Fiendgod Body Refiner and in using divine
abilities, and although this was just a competition of the arts one
could use based on their comprehension of the Dao…the fact that he
had defeated a two-clawed Raindragon Guard still filled Ning’s
heart with incomparable joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” Seated
atop the distant stone pillar, Bloodshadow rose to his feet. Shaking
his head, he laughed. “Junior apprentice-brother, you are already
so impressive after entering our school. In the future, you will
definitely not be any weaker than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you praise me too much.” Ning rose as well. “If
we were in a real life-and-death battle, I probably wouldn’t have
been able to withstand a single blow from you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodshadow laughed.
This junior apprentice-brother of his was incredibly talented, and
yet clear-minded and modest. He hadn’t turned smug from his victory
in the Dao Debate. Most likely, in the future, this youth would have
astonishing accomplishments. He was worth befriending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…”
Bloodshadow laughed, then with a flicker, disappeared from the arena,
reappearing before the white-haired elder, who he gave two jade
bottles to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath. He had gone all out in his earlier battle against
Bloodshadow. The sword art he had used was the strongest one
available to him, and by relying on the power of his soul, he had
gone all out to generate five of those [Tripartite Lotus Swords]!
This was his limit. He had nothing further up his sleeve…and would
probably lose the next match.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if he was
going to fight, he was going to fight to the bitter end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any other
senior fellow disciples who would like to exchange pointers with me?”
Ning looked about the room and spoke in a clear voice. His voice
echoed in every corner of the palace.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Dao Debate
Palace once more fell silent. Everyone turned to look at their
neighbors. Since Ji Ning was even able to defeat Bloodshadow in a Dao
Debate, defeating him would be no easy task. Who would be the next?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His heart…it has
changed!” In that quiet corner, the short elder suddenly spoke out.
“This last Dao Debate was a form of baptism for your disciple.”
Immortal Diancai turned to look towards Ning as well. There was no
hesitating in Ning’s eyes at all; instead, there was a frightening
desire for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai nodded lightly. “His heart has indeed changed. It is purer
now. Before this, he had many miscellaneous thoughts in his heart,
but right now, all he desires is the next battle. This is indeed a
rare baptism for his Dao-heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had only one
thought in his heart right now; to engage in the next battle! If he
was going to fight, he was going to fight to the very end!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Dao Debate
Palace was silent for three breaths. Finally, an azure-robed woman
walked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is senior
apprentice-sister Whitesnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Whitesnow’s [Celestial Silknet Formation] is
extremely powerful. In terms of just the Dao, not even senior
apprentice-brother Bloodshadow is a match for senior
apprentice-sister Whitesnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I wonder if
this junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has anything else left up his
sleeve. If he does not, he is probably going to lose.”
Conversations were going on everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, surrounded by many fellow disciples, he
stared into the distance, then said softly, “If my guess is
correct, that was the limit of junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s
power. This next battle…junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is going
to lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When he encounters
junior apprentice-sister Whitesnow’s [Celestial Silknet Formation],
this junior apprentice-brother is going to lose.” This was the soft
comment by the fat, sloppy-looking youth as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister. Will junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning win?”
Ninelotus was next to the black-robed maiden, who stared into the
distance. “Junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is probably at his
limit. This should be his final battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder,
standing in the corner of the room, nodded as well. “It’s about
time. This series of Dao Debates should be coming to a conclusion.
Your disciple is at his limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai nodded lightly, continuing to stare towards his disciple…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the pillar. Ning
stood there, waiting quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, win. Win! I believe in you. You will
definitely win.” Mu Northson’s fists were clenched tightly, and
he called out in a high voice in the distance. Ning smiled towards
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
stepped out from the side-door, leaping gracefully atop the opposing
stone pillar. She looked towards the distant Ning, her gaze bringing
a cold, quiet feeling. Looking at her was like looking at a sickly,
yet beautiful woman. She finally spoke out. “Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, I have chosen the Skynet Golem. Be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, please feel free!” Ning sat down in the lotus
position, and the azure-robed woman did the same. The two stared at
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!” The
white-haired elder let out a loud shout. Rumble…the grand sealing
barrier once more covered the entire battle arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” The gaze of
the azure-robed woman, seated in the lotus position, was cold and
dim. The Skynet Golem beneath her instantly began to emit one line of
silk after another, transforming into streaks of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Neo-Tripartite
Lotus Sword]!” A sharp look flashed through Ning’s eyes. Not
hesitating at all, he immediately, consecutively released fifteen
flying swords from the Thousandswords Golem, creating five
[Tripartite Lotus Swords]. These five flashes of sword-light…they
blossomed into lotus flowers, streaking forward to greet the flashing
lines of silk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silken rays of
light suddenly slashed out in arious arcs. Instantly, the entire
world seemed to change, as these silken ribbons of light actually
formed a giant, completely sealed spherical region, trapping Ning’s
five [Neo-Tripartite Lotus Swords] within them. The five flashes of
sword-light wildly struck at one location, and a large bulge appeared
on the side of the silken ribbons of light, but it still successfully
kept the sword-light trapped within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Constrict!” The
azure-robed woman, seated in the lotus position, shouted softly. The
silken ribbons of light, in the shape of that giant sphere, began to
swivel and shrink, beginning to crush down upon the five flashes of
sword-light within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning could
release these fifteen flying swords and control new ones…if he
wasn’t able to defeat this technique, even if he unleashed more
flying swords, the end result would simply be that they would be
trapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
strove to control his swords to break through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
azure-robed woman once more pointed. Whoosh! Yet another silken
ribbon of light flew out from the golem, this one moving directly
towards Ning’s Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
gaze turned cold. Three more flying swords flew out from the
Thousandswords Golem’s back, transforming to yet another
[Tripartite Lotus Sword] and intercepting the ribbon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were six
[Tripartite Lotus Swords] that had been unleashed, and Ning’s eyes
were now completely bloodshot. Taxing. This was incredibly taxing.
But Ning didn’t think of anything else. In his heart, there was
only one thought; to use all of his power and fight to the bitter
end! To force his flying swords to unleash the greatest amount of
power possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, the
only thing in Ning’s heart…was the sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the
azure-robed woman stared at each other, the golems they were
controlling clashing against each other time and time again. Clearly,
the azure-robed woman held the upper hand…but no matter what, she
wasn’t able to defeat Ji Ning. In particular, with that giant,
spherical region, one enormous bulge after another would appear.
Clearly, the five rays of sword light within were still struggling,
and with greater and greater power. The azure-robed woman couldn’t
help but focus a great deal of her attention on that sphere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the corner of the
Dao Debate Palace. The short elder’s eyes suddenly lit up, and he
murmured to himself, “My heart holds only the sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai stared
at his disciple as well. He, too, had noticed Ning’s change. “My
heart holds only the sword!” Immortal Diancai said softly,
“Finally, his sword-heart has finally begun to reach this level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now things are
unclear,” the short old man sighed. “This disciple of yours truly
is a rare talent. This Dao Debate Palace is currently filled with the
disciples of our Black-White College. So many geniuses are
present…this disciple of yours is welcoming all challengers, and so
in the end, he will definitely be defeated. And yet, this process has
caused his sword-heart to grow brighter and brighter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s still early.
Let’s see if he can actually comprehend it thoroughly.” Immortal
Diancai stared at Ji Ning. Stared at him without blinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simultaneously
executing six [Tripartite Lotus Swords] was Ning at his absolute
limit, and he even felt his head going dizzy. But Ning didn’t think
of anything else; the only thing he wanted to do was fight! Fight
with all his power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart was
completely focused on those flying swords of his. In this
moment…Ning, who had gained insight into the heart of a Sword
Immortal long ago, was currently seeing his own Sword Immortal’s
heart grow brighter and brighter. In fact, one memory after another
began to flit up through his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I am going
to demonstrate the first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword] to you -
the Lustrous Sword-Heart!” Prior to this series of Dao Debates,
Ning had gone to see Immortal Diancai, who had carefully explained
the first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword] to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the first
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
like fire, slashing through the air but not dissipating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, too, is the
first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ray of sword-light
flashed like water, circling and spinning in the air, as though the
sky itself had been parted from the world by this layer of water..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, too, is the
first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cyan light that tore
open the skies themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One sword technique
another another…they were clearly different sword techniques. Some
were average in power, while others were incredibly powerful. But
according to Immortal Diancai, all of these techniques were the first
stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword] is a supreme sword technique which leads to one of the Grand
Daos, the Dao of the Sword. In order to become a true Sword Immortal
who has comprehended the Grand Dao of the Sword, the first thing you
need is a sword-heart. Over many years of training, you have long ago
unconsciously developed the heart of a Sword Immortal, but the so
called sword-heart requires one to truly have supreme loyalty to the
‘sword’. You must understand your own sword-heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you truly
comprehend your sword-heart and learn what it means to be a Sword
Immortal…only then will you have opened the gates to actually
becoming a Sword Immortal. That will be the moment when you will
naturally learn how to execute the first stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] - Lustrous Sword-Heart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After your
sword-heart becomes lustrous and bright, you will be able to see the
true path a Sword Immortal must follow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scenes of Immortal
Diancai displaying the first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], the
‘Lustrous Sword-Heart’, played over and over in his mind. Some of
the attacks were extremely weak, while others were extremely strong.
However, all of them were flashing through Ning’s mind, and Ning
felt vaguely moved; he began to dimly understand something, although
he didn’t fully comprehend yet. However, he knew that he had
already begun to gain a few insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Sword-light
continued to flash and dance. The [Tripartite Lotus Sword] continued
to flash in the air, and the sword-light grew sharper and sharper,
the more growing mightier and mightier, to the point where they began
to press down on the silken ribbons of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
five [Tripartite Lotus Swords] within the enormous spherical region
were beginning to struggle more and more forcefully as well. One
giant bulge after another appeared on the surface of the sphere of
silken light, each bulge greater than the last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whitesnow, the distant
azure-robed woman who was seated in the lotus position, began to
sweat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Holyfire,
watching from afar, had a changed look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fat, sloppy-looking
youth’s eyes instantly turned round. “How the hell…he actually,
he actually made a breakthrough in comprehending the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed woman’s
face, formerly as cold as frost, suddenly had a look of shock appear
on it. “A Sword Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sudden explosion rang
out. The sphere of silken light, which had been stretched to its
limits, finally exploded. Silk ribbons scattered everywhere, and the
six [Tripartite Lotus Swords] once more rose into the skies with
incomparable sharpness. The power of the swords was clearly much
greater than before, and they charged directly towards the Skynet
Golem. Soon, the protective armor of the Skynet Golem was shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
white-haired elder called out in a high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of disbelief
filled the face of the azure-robed woman. Someone had actually made a
breakthrough mid-battle? She couldn’t help but mumble to herself,
“A monster, he really is a monster of the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet,
turning his gaze towards the entire hall. He called out in a high
voice, “Are there any other senior fellow disciples who wish to
exchange pointers with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder in the
corner couldn’t help but say, “A true genius of the Dao of the
Sword. He really is a genius of the Dao of the Sword. This Ji Ning
was born to walk the path of the Sword Immortals! His innate affinity
towards the sword surpasses that of others; in fact, we can use the
word ‘monstrous’ to describe it. In addition, he has a heart
which is supremely devoted to the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai stared at the distant Ji Ning. “He was meant to be a Sword
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another disciple
has gone up.” The short elder nodded. “It’s good that he did.
What Ji Ning needs right now is battle experience. The greater a
pressure is brought to bear on him, the more lustrous his sword-heart
will become.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps…through
these battles…he might even comprehend the first stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] - Lustrous Sword-Heart!” Immortal Diancai mused
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the stone pillar. On the other stone pillar was a black-robed youth.
Ning’s eyes seemed to be filled with the light of the sword, and he
said in a clear voice, “Senior apprentice-brother, please make your
move!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_39____Three_Foot_Sword"></A>
Chapter 39 - [Three-Foot Sword] - The First Stance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, for you to gain sudden enlightenment regarding
the sword in a moment of battle means that you truly are a marvelous
talent for training in the sword. No wonder Immortal Diancai took you
on as his disciple.” The black-robed youth said calmly, “Junior
apprentice-brother, my techniques are far more vicious than senior
apprentice-sister Whitesnow. You must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, feel free to use everything you have!” Ning sat
down in the lotus position, and the black-robed man did so as well.
The two stared at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
was silent once again. Previously, the two Wanxiang Adepts,
Bloodshadow and Whitesnow, had been defeated consecutively. The
person who had now joined the fray, Venomblood, was naturally even
more formidable than the two of them in a discourse on the Dao.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go! Go! Go!” The
black-robed youth’s eyes flashed with cold light. Instantly,
oily-jade hooks began to fly out from the back of the golem he was
controlling in the arena below. Eighteen oily-green poisoned hooks
slashed through the air, and while flying over, the tips of these
eighteen poisoned hooks began to faintly glow with a venomous,
tricolor light. The eighteen poisoned hooks flew straight towards the
Thousandswords Golem which Ning was controlling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though the
power of this attack was compressed; he didn’t sense any danger at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed slightly. A tricolored poisonous light? Previously, he had
fought against Bloodshadow and Whitesnow. Bloodshadow was apparently
someone who focused on a single Dao, and had mixed in his insights
into other Daos into his techniques; much like Ning, he had reached
the Dao Domain level in just a single Dao, and not in the others.
However, Bloodshadow had reached an extremely deep level of
understanding into that Dao, most likely far surpassing Ning’s
understanding of his own. Ning had to rely on the power of his
‘divine soul’ to defeat Bloodshadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Whitesnow, she
should have mastered two different Dao Domains! And this
Venomblood…should have mastered three different Dao Domains!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai had
told him that after he reached the level of having three Dao Domains,
he would be able to unleash the true power of his [Tripartite Lotus
Sword]. But this Venomblood had already reached this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if you have
gained three Dao Domains? Go!” A fierce sword-light flashed in
Ning’s eyes, and eighteen flying swords instantly flew out from the
back of his Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen flying
swords slashed through the air, instantly booming into lotus flowers
and transforming into eighteen flashing sword-lights of the
[Tripartite Lotus Swords]. Although a sword-light formed from three
swords was very powerful…when dealing with a foe who shot out
eighteen attacks, Ning naturally would use eighteen of his own to
deal with it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A competition on
quantity? Ji Ning had never feared anyone in this regard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cling!” “Clang!”
“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen blooming
lotuses of sword-light on one side, and eighteen venomous tricolored
hooks on the other. It was as though eighteen Immortal practitioners
were controlling them; they clashed in midair time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those eighteen venomous
tricolored hooks possessed shocking power and were able to completely
suppress Ning’s attacks, but Ning’s sword-light attacks were
aligned with water, and possessed tremendous resilience and
elasticity. In addition, the tremendous pressure caused Ning to once
more enter that earlier battle-mode; to enter the mindset of
discarding everything, leaving behind only the sword in his heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My heart holds only the
sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
The lotuses of sword-light flew about, growing sharper and sharper,
to the point where even the distant, spectating disciples could
visibly notice that the power with which Ning controlled his
[Tripartite Lotus Swords] was slowly growing. The sword-lights seemed
to be growing ‘sharper’, to the point where they were slowly
taking on a life of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were continuing to
grow more powerful! The might of the lotus sword-lights continuously
rose!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still in a
prajna-state of comprehending the sword.” Holyfire stared into the
distance. “This junior apprentice-brother possesses truly
terrifying potential. He truly is a marvelous student of the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of the
sword-light is continuously rising. Can it be that this junior
apprentice-brother is really going to enter the first stage of the
Sword Immortal today?” The fat, sloppy-looking youth watched
quietly. On the path of Immortals, where were many subtle, varying
branches of enlightenment, such as the ‘Yin-Yang branch’, the
‘Taiji branch’, the ‘Sword Immortal branch’, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortals
traversed the Grand Dao of the Sword! Sword Immortals had always been
famous for their combat power, and could be described as the branch
most suited for combat. For example, Immortal Diancai, or Immortal
Northwalker, the most famous figure in the entire history of the
Black-White College. They were all Sword Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.” The
black-robed maiden let out a soft exclamation of praise as well. As
for Ninelotus, upon hearing this, she immediately stared towards Ning
in the arena, her eyes filled with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the corner of the
Dao Debate Palace, the short elder was leisurely holding a calabash
of wine. Taking a mouthful of the Immortal wine, he glanced sideways
at Immortal Diancai, who was staring at the battle without blinking.
Fivecraze let out a snickering, strange laugh. “Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai, don’t worry. Judging from the
situation…this disciple of yours is almost there. Soon, he shall
truly understand what his sword-heart is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Immortal
Diancai’s lips moved slightly, but his eyes continued to focus
unblinkingly on the battle going on. This was, after all, his very
first disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth,
Venomblood, continued to sit there in the lotus position, the look on
his face growing increasingly ugly. “How can it be like this? A
prajna-state of enlightenment should have a limit; how it is that his
sword-light is continuously rising in power? At first, he was at a
disadvantage, but now he’s slowly beginning to gain the upper hand.
When exactly will there be a limit to this prajna-state?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is he
gaining insights into?” The black-robed youth gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the likes of the
Sloppy Daoist and the other supreme disciples, they were able to tell
at a single glance that Ning was walking onto the path of Sword
Immortals. However, Venomblood’s experience was clearly a bit
lacking; all he knew was that Ning was in the middle of a
prajna-state of enlightenment, but he had no idea that Ning was
embarking onto the path of Sword Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, those
eighteen lotus flowers of sword-light clashed more and more
frenetically against those eighteen venomous tricolored hooks. Those
venomous hooks were struggling as much as they could…but they were
clearly at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grr!” The
black-robed youth’s gaze flashed with a fierce light, and a berserk
feeling filled his heart. Those eighteen venomous hooks instantly
began to transform, forming an enormous venomous tricolored hook that
was more than thirty meters long. The entire venomous tricolored hook
glowed with a hazy light, and it swept directly towards Ning’s
Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The
eighteen lotus flowers of sword-light instantly transformed as well.
With six flying swords forming a formation base, they instantly
changed into an enormous [Tripartite Lotus Sword] which went to
welcome the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!” An
explosive collision. The venomous hook was instantly blown apart. The
enormous [Tripartite Lotus Sword] howled through the air, piercing
directly through the protective armor over the body of the Venomhook
Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
white-haired elder’s voice rang out once more, and at the same
time, the grand sealing barrier began to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” A gloomy
look was in the eyes of the black-robed youth, who had struggled for
so long and yet had still lost. He gave the fur-clad youth seated
atop the other stone pillar a glance from the corner of his eyes.
Then, he leapt forward, transforming into a streak of light as he
left the battlefield. He handed the two jade bottles to the
white-haired elder, then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Dao Debate
Palace was completely silent for a moment. And then, all sorts of
discussions rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Venomblood lost. Senior apprentice-brother
Venomblood has gained three Dao Domains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even senior
apprentice-brother Venomblood lost. What should we do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Variations on this
conversation filled the entire Dao Debate Palace. Many of the
disciples were saying the same thing; if even Venomblood had lost,
which of them should go up next?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done! Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, well done!” Northson resolutely
supported Ning. He was the only person who called out in support of
Ning…and he and Ning were the only members in the new disciples
‘faction’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other fellow
disciples were all chatting amongst themselves, and also discussing
who amongst them should be the next to go up. Only, none of them
noticed that something unusual was happening to Ji Ning right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, not even the
Primal Daoists that were watching this through a water-scrying
technique were able to notice. After all, they weren’t actually
present and able to witness things firsthand. Only two did - Immortal
Fivecraze and Immortal Diancai. They noticed something unusual about
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After defeating the
black-robed youth, Venomblood, Ning hadn’t risen to his feet as he
had in the past. Instead, he continued to stay seated in the lotus
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sense his aura.”
Immortal Fivecraze’s eyes were growing brighter and brighter. “Ji
Ning’s aura…his aura is sharpening and intensifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai’s eyes were shining as well. He stared fixedly at Ning,
seated in the lotus position atop the stone pillar. For a powerful
Sword Immortal like Diancai, he could feel that the distant Ji Ning
was also beginning to emit a similar sword aura as Diancai himself
had. Although it was incredibly weak, it was slowly beginning to
manifest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s growing more
and more powerful.” Immortal Fivecraze couldn’t even be bothered
to drink wine. He stared excitedly at the distant Ning. “I feel as
though he has completely changed into a sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He made the
breakthrough.” A smile appeared on the face of Immortal Diancai as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came out…the distant Ning arose from the lotus position, coming to
his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been
battling against Whitesnow, Ning’s mind had become filled with the
scenes of his master, Immortal Diancai, teaching him about the sword.
At that time, he had gained a vague feeling for what the ‘Lustrous
Sword-Heart’ was. Now that he had battled Venomblood, his insights
had grown even deeper, and the power of his sword-light was growing
increasingly great as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant he had
defeated Venomblood, he felt as though he were a bubble that had
stretched to its limit, then instantly exploded. All of those doubts
and questions in his heart had vanished. Ning’s heart had become
truly lustrous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to
become a Sword Immortal, you must have the utmost sincerity owards
the sword! The sword, and the sword in your heart. If you have the
sword in your heart, then even with a rock, a throwing hammer, or a
wooden stick, you’ll still be able to execute sword arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a Sword
Immortal, everything is part of the Dao of the Sword. The Rainwater
Dao, the Daos of Wind, Fire, and other Daos…they will all be merged
into the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword is my
body. The sword is my life. The sword is my path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
His eyes, his entire body…every single part of him seemed to be
brimming with sword-ki! It was as though Ning himself was a peerless
sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword of a Sword
Immortal was the Sword Immortal himself. He was the sword, and he
could use any magic treasures in executing sword arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword of a Sword
Immortal was his Dao. This Dao, when taken to its absolute peak, led
one to supremacy amongst the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword of a Sword
Immortal was what he relied on. On his path as an Immortal
cultivator, only by using the sword…would he be able to carve a
path to the very top. If Gods blocked him, he would kill Gods; if
Buddhas blocked him, he would slay the Buddhas. He would carve a path
through all which would oppose him, and he would rely on his sword to
do this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want for my mother
and father to be able to live forever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want my loved ones
to be able to live joyful lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want for tragedies
to never befall me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to never
again be controlled by the hands of fate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-heart
was now completely shining and translucent; all of his hopes, his
desires, his dreams, they were all embodied within his sword! His
body, his life, even his future hopes and aspirations; they were all
entrusted to the sword. The sword was what he would rely on to carve
out his future and his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword], the Lustrous Sword-Heart.” Ning instantly
comprehended the very first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
different ways in which the first stance could be executed. What one
needed to do was to release the technique in accordance with the
insight one had gained into one’s own sword-heart. That would be
enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
Standing there, atop the stone pillar, he stared at his fellow
disciples in the Dao Debate Palace, then once more spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any other
fellow disciples who wish to provide me with guidance?”
</P>

Chapter 40 - That Chop
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
disciples within the Dao Debate Palace began to turn their gazes
towards a small number of people. Venomblood was already quite a
powerful Wanxiang Adept in terms of the Dao Debates, and yet even he
had been defeated by Ji Ning. Then, in order to defeat Ji Ning…they
would need someone even more powerful. There were only so many who
fit the criteria.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only ten or
so disciples who had multiple Dao Domains and were extremely strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the situation,
I would like to test your strength for myself, junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” A white-robed man who was standing
next to Holyfire suddenly stood out with a calm laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont
Blackcurrent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Northmont Blackcurrent is about to engage. Senior
apprentice-brother Blackcurrent’s ‘Five Energies Grand Grappling
Hand’ technique is astonishingly strong, far more so than senior
apprentice-brother Venomblood’s technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If senior
apprentice-brother Blackcurrent engages, he will definitely win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Debates rang out once
again. Blackcurrent, amongst the Wanxiang Adepts of the Black-White
College, could be considered a well-known figure. But of course, in
normal, real battles, the Fiendgod disciples would be even stronger.
The likes of Bloodshadow, for example, possessed real combat power
that was simply heaven-defying. On the battlefield, Fiendgod Body
Refiners possessed an innate advantage to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Blackcurrent
was a Ki Refiner, if one only looked at comprehension of the Dao, he
definitely was one of the most impressive of the disciples who had
comprehended multiple Dao Domains. He vastly surpassed Venomblood and
the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont
Blackcurrent?” Ning looked towards him, immediately recognizing
him. When he had first gone to visit the Black-White College, he had
encountered this Blackcurrent fellow. Back then, Blackcurrent had
held him in no regard. “Brother Baiwei, back then, described this
Northmont Blackcurrent as a viper dressed in a sheepskin. Now, it
seems…at least I see the sheepskin part.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackcurrent had a
smile on his face. He moved with leisurely grace, and was dressed in
white clothes. Indeed, he appeared quite elegant, and it seemed as
though he had quite a few friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Blackcurrent
emerged from the side room with a construct. With a step, he flew
directly atop the stone pillar, and his golem also landed at the
arena below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Blackcurrent stood on the pillar,
staring into the distance. Laughing, he said, “When I first met
you, I had no idea that I would be discussing the Dao with you today
at the Dao Debate Palace. The changes of the world truly are
marvelous and remarkable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to battle
with you, senior apprentice-brother…I, too, am amazed by the
countless transformations of the world,” Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackcurrent nodded
gently, but the desire for combat was quite evident in his eyes.
Because he was born from a fairly remote branch of the Northmont clan
of Stillwater, he had always looked down upon those main lineage
disciples who had relied on the protection of their parents. He had
long ago relegated Ning to the side of people such as Baiwei. Ning’s
earlier repeated successes had caused him to feel all the more
unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His talent is quite
exceptional. However, it’s enough for him to have won this many
battles,” Blackcurrent mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…a
white-haired, white-robed man standing amidst the many fellow
disciples within the Dao Debate Palace spoke out. “Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” Ning turned his to look, and as he
did, he clasped his hands. “Senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodshadow was a bit
weaker in terms of the Dao Debate, but in a real battle, he was
definitely one of the top-ranked disciples of the third generation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, first you defeated three Zifu Disciples, then you
defeated myself, Whitesnow, and Venomblood. And now, you are going to
battle with Northmont Blackcurrent…I am truly in admiration of you.
Junior apprentice-brother Blackcurrent is exceptionally talented,
while you, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, are a peerless genius.
It is hard to say who will win this fight. I’m willing to take out
a treasure and add to the intrigue of this battle. If you are able to
defeat junior apprentice-brother Blackcurrent, I will give this
treasure to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as these words
came out, there was instantly a hullabaloo. Bloodshadow’s words
were rather ‘damaging’ to Blackcurrent’s face, and he clearly
was closer to Ji Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
Blackcurrent felt some unhappiness in his heart, but Bloodshadow was
one of the third generation disciples he could least afford to
irritate. On the surface, he maintained his calm, smiling demeanor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I accept
this?” Ning immediately said. “No need to be humble,”
Bloodshadow replied. “This treasure is a Mortal-ranked magic
treasure; to me, it’s not very useful. When I was carrying out an
assignment for the Raindragon Guard, I accidentally entered an
Immortal estate, and I was lucky enough to manage to pick up a sword
formation technique. I saw that you, junior apprentice-brother, are
skilled in controlling flying swords, and quite a few of them at once
at that. This flying sword formation I acquired is a [Heavenly
Spirits, Earthly Fiends] sword formation with a total of 108 flying
swords. They are useless to me, but to you, junior
apprentice-brother, they will definitely be of great use. However, if
you want to acquire them, you’ll have to show off your abilities in
this battle, junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed,
white-haired Bloodshadow had a smile on his face. He did indeed have
a very good opinion of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had also been the
first of the Wanxiang Adepts to engage Ning. In reality, he was
simply ‘throwing a brick to attract jade’, seeking to draw out
the others. He often engaged in life-and-death battles, and so his
senses were exceptionally acute. He could vaguely sense that the
distant Ji Ning was like a sword, and he had understood that this
junior apprentice-brother of his would have an unlimited potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In taking out this set
of flying swords…although he said that it would be the reward for a
victory, even if Ning lost, when the time came, Bloodshadow could
still find an excuse to give it to Ning. And so, the two would
naturally grow closer to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will definitely
work hard,” Ning said. How could this Mortal-ranked flying sword
formation be truly useless to Bloodshadow? If nothing else, he could
take it to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and exchange it for quite
a few elemental badges. Clearly, this senior apprentice-brother
wanted to befriend him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That kid Bloodshadow
is the first to move to befriend your disciple.” The short elder
held the gourd of wine in his hand, and was drinking it while
chatting leisurely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
lightly. “Bloodshadow is also a truly heroic figure amongst the
third generation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He stands on the
side of your disciple, so he’s a heroic figure?” The short elder
gave him a stare, then said with pursed lips, “Still, to tell the
truth, although this kid Bloodshadow is a bit slow in terms of
comprehending the Dao, he’s moved stably and confidently. In
particular…he’s quite good at enduring suffering. Of the various
Fiendgod Body Refining Techniques, the [Indestructible Bloodshadow
Body] is described as the most painful technique to train in. If one
is successful, however, the results are bizarrely, astonishingly
powerful. In addition, this kid, Bloodshadow, often takes on
dangerous missions for the Raindragon Guard. With his special,
unbreakable body, he has walked the path between life and death on
multiple occasions, and his power is increasing at a faster and
faster rate. His divine ability is fairly powerful as well, now…when
he first joined, he was unremarkable, but now he’s one of the most
powerful third generation disciples. I imagine that in a few more
centuries, he will have become one of the most powerful members of
our Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have such a good
view of him?” Immortal Diancai was surprised. The short elder
sighed. “Although comprehending the Dao is important, the Dao-heart
is even more important. Once you’ve seen as much as I have, you
will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Immortal
Diancai gave Bloodshadow a long, deep look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Battle’s
starting.” The short elder’s eyes lit up as he stared at the
distant battle. Ning and Blackcurrent had each already begun to
control their golems in combat. “Junior apprentice-brother Diancai,
who do you think will win? As I see it, although your disciples has
comprehended the first stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], that first
stance involves comprehending one’s own sword-heart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is his
sword-heart like? No one knows. How powerful will the techniques he
unleashes be? Hard to say. But this ‘Five Energies Grand Grappling
Hand’ of Blackcurrent is far more powerful than the technique that
Venomblood kid was using.” The short elder looked at Immortal
Diancai, eagerly awaiting a look of concern to appear on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Immortal Diancai
remained as solemn as ever. “What is his sword-heart like? We’ll
know if we watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” The short
elder mumbled a response, then shook his head and sighed. “Ohoho,
your disciple is at a disadvantage. Seems as though it’ll be
dangerous for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone watching what
was going on within the sealed arena was holding their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will this junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning be able to produce another miracle?”
Holyfire’s eyes were narrowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
the sharpness of his sword-light is no longer increasing. Has his
prajna-state come to an end?” The fat, sloppy-looking youth frowned
as he watched. “If it has already come to an end, it’s hard to
say who will win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, will junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning be able to
win?” Ninelotus asked. The black-robed maiden, the Rainbowflame
Fairy, just watched silently without saying a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Win, win, win.”
Northson and Winterain were standing together in a corner. Northson’s
fists were tightly clenched, and his eyes were round.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation. Although Ning, seated in the lotus position atop
the stone pillar, was at a definite disadvantage, those nine
[Tripartite Lotus Swords] were continuing to struggle and resist the
enormous ‘Five Energies Grand Grappling Hand’. However, by the
looks of things, if they exchanged a few more blows, the [Tripartite
Lotus Swords] were going to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very calm. He
didn’t panic in the slightest, which caused Blackcurrent to laugh
coldly in his heart. “It’s about time for you to lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t know
was that Ning was currently storing up his power. In his heart, the
various insights that he had gained into the sword were surging out
in waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be carefree! To
do as I please!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To force even fate
to beat a retreat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes suddenly
exploded with a terrifying sword-intent, and an astonishing
sword-intent radiated from his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] - Lustrous Sword-Heart!” Ning’s gaze
solidified, and instantly, a rumbling sound could be heard. Every
single flying sword on the back of the Thousandswords Golem flew out,
including the flying swords he had used before. There were a thousand
flying swords, clustered there in the air, and they caused all of the
spectators to be completely shocked. So many flying swords?! What
were they going to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
thousand flying swords was pointing directly to the ‘Five Energies
Grand Grappling Hand’ ahead of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!” Ning
bellowed forth this single word! The thousand flying swords instantly
blossomed into lotus flowers, and at the same time, they all chopped
forward. The thousand flying swords had instantly transformed into a
single, enormous sword-light. Carrying irresistible power and
majesty, they chopped forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This single chop! It
contained the invincible will of Ning’s sword-heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life, Ning
had experienced the information explosion era. As the saying goes,
one who enters the red dust of the mortal world 1 will depart while
covered in it. The distracting thoughts generated by the information
explosion era were even more astonishing than the distracting
thoughts generated during the era of wandering barbarians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experiences he had
in this life, the lives and deaths of those he loved, the warmth of
family; it was these things that allowed Ning’s heart to slowly
grow lustrous and be purified of those distracting thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a person were to
live in a perfect utopia, a peach garden beyond all worldly matters,
then perhaps that person would be able to maintain a pure, lustrous
heart. But this sort of pure, lustrous heart would be a very weak
one. Upon encountering any setbacks or seductions, it might easily
crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had seen far
too many things in his past life, in the information explosion era.
Tormented and wracked by pain, he had watched as others freely ran
about, read books, had lovers, and more. How painful and tortured
that had been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart had long ago
been stained by the red dust of the mortal world. In this life, the
love and warmth of family had slowly polished it bright, and now, his
heart was all the stronger and all the more unbreakable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was admittedly
praiseworthy for someone who stood at the peak of a mountain to
maintain perfect purity, but for someone to be born from the sludge
to remain unsullied was even harder to do!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my first
stance of my [Three-Foot Sword]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning roared the word
‘chop’ three times, and the sword-light in his eyes was visible
to the naked eye. That powerful sword-intent, that mighty,
irresistible will; it caused even those two Immortals watching from
afar to be moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand flying
swords, linked into a single, massive burst of sword-light, were all
chopping in unison towards a single direction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although that mighty,
heaven-defying ‘Five Energies Grand Grappling Hand’ was able to
resist for just a brief moment, with a mighty boom, it shattered
apart like glass.

Chapter 41 - Yu Wei and Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the extremely
high-ranking disciples who had been seated, such as senior
apprentice-brother Holyfire, the fat, sloppy-looking youth, and the
black-robed maiden had all risen to their feet. Looks of shock were
on their faces, and they stared, stunned, at the fur-clad youth atop
the stone pillar in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Northmont
Blackcurrent, located on the other stone pillar within the grand
sealing formation, his face had instantly turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I lost?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, how could I have
lost? How could I have lost?” Blackcurrent’s eyes were filled
with disbelief. He was an incomparably prideful figure. He didn’t
even hold high-level members of the Northmont clan, such as main
lineage members like Northmont Baiwei, with any regard. This was
precisely because he was absolutely confident in his own abilities.
But a new disciple who had just entered the school, and one who was
extremely friendly terms with Baiwei to boot…had actually defeated
him in a ‘Dao Debate’, an arena he had been extremely
self-confident in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was that
sword…that sword…” Blackcurrent’s mind still clearly
remembered that terrifying sword, that chop that was launched
simultaneously by a thousand flying swords. It felt as though that
chop had cut a scar straight into his Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
sword. Only when facing that sword head-on can a person truly
understand how terrifying it is. A sword with no regrets and nothing
held back; a sword which nothing can block.” Blackcurrent’s heart
was filled with panic and disbelief that he had lost, but when he
thought back to that sword, he felt completely powerless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning wins!” The
white-haired elder shouted loudly, and the entire grand sealing
formation vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Blackcurrent, thank you for taking it easy on me.”
Ning’s voice rang out, echoing throughout the entire Dao Debate
Palace. Only now did Blackcurrent come to his senses. He forcibly
clamped down on the wild thoughts running through his mind, then
clasped his hands and said, “Junior apprentice-brother, you truly
are formidable. I sigh that I am inferior to you.” After speaking,
he released the bond with the golem, then transformed into a streak
of light and left the arena. He handed the two jade bottles to the
white-haired elder, and then, silently and wordlessly, entered the
crowd of spectating fellow disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
sword,” the fat, sloppy-looking youth mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In a few decades,
our Black-White College will have produced yet another formidable
figure.” Holyfire had a hint of a smile on his face as he looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the entire Dao
Debate Palace, only the two Immortals truly understood that sword
technique of Ning’s! “Lustrous Sword-Heart! What a fine Lustrous
Sword-Heart!” The short elder’s eyes were shining as he stared at
Ning. “Such a powerful sword-heart, such a resolute sword-heart…our
Black-White College has truly taken in a treasure this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have indeed.”
Immortal Diancai was staring towards the distant Ning as well, and
his eyes were blazing. “I wonder, how in the world did this
disciple of mine manage to generate a sword-heart such as this in ten
or so short years. The experiences he had did involve life and death,
but for them to produce such a powerful sword-heart…this is truly
inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, just you
watch and see. Those other fellows are probably going to arrive
soon,” the short elder chortled. Immortal Diancai laughed as well.
The short elder let out a weird laugh and said, “They are
definitely feeling regret as well. Regret for not having come to the
Dao Debate Palace to watch in person..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The headmaster of the
Black-White College, Daoist Jadesea, was currently seated in the
lotus position on his bed. Above him, there was a watery scrying
mirror which clearly displayed the discourses on the Dao that were
going on within the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That sword!” A
look of shock appeared on the face of Daoist Jadesea, who was so
handsome that women would be infatuated with him. “Can it be that
he has embarked on the path of the Sword Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh!” Daoist
Jadesea let out a regretful sigh. He could only see the images
through water-scrying, but the auras, the presences, the ripples of
the world…all of the intricate details were lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going.”
Daoist Jadesea didn’t hesitate at all. Waving his hand, he made the
water-scrying mirror disappear, and then his body flickered and
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few of the
Primal Daoists of the Black-White College were watching this battle
through the water-scrying technique. When they saw that sword emerge,
all of them were awestruck. However, because none of them had
personally seen and sensed the sword in the Dao Debate Palace, they
weren’t completely certain of what it was either. Thus, all of them
hurried towards the Dao Debate Palace…and even two of the Immortals
headed there as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third generation
disciples who were in the Dao Debate Palace, in turn, had no idea
about what was going on in the outside world. They were all chatting
amongst themselves. Even Blackcurrent had lost? Then who would be the
next to stand forward? Blackcurrent could be considered one of the
top ten figures amongst those who had multiple Dao Domains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, don’t be so sentimental. It’s just a
set of flying swords.” Senior apprentice-brother Bloodshadow was
currently chatting with Ning, and offering to him that set of
[Heavenly Spirits, Earthly Fiends] sword formation. Ning laughed.
“Fine. Then your junior apprentice-brother will accept it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The simple interactions
Ning had had with Bloodshadow made him feel quite well-disposed
towards him. He accepted the set of flying swords, and by doing so,
he was clearly acknowledging Bloodshadow as a friend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more like
it.” Bloodshadow nodded. “Junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, your
talent is astonishing. However, the path of Immortals is not one in
which you can simply bury yourself in training. You also need to
wander the world and experience many things for yourself. I imagine
that in a few years at most, junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you
will go out and adventure through the world. Most likely, you will
also join the Raindragon Guard and whatnot. If there’s anything you
need, feel free to come find me. I’m quite familiar regarding the
Raindragon Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
I will definitely go and trouble you, senior apprentice-brother,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Bloodshadow
suddenly turned his head to look, and Ning did so as well. A figure
had emerged from the third generation disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her?” Ning’s
pupils contracted. The person who had walked out was a black-robed
maiden. Previously, she had sat there, surrounded by others; even
Ninelotus had been by her side. Clearly, her status was extremely
high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” The black-robed maiden walked over,
then said in a cool, calm voice, “I should be the most powerful of
the disciples who have comprehended multiple Dao Domains. If you
defeat me, then it will naturally be up to senior apprentice-brother
Holyfire and the others will come out to fight you.” After
finishing, she turned and moved towards the side room to select a
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are doomed.”
Bloodshadow sucked a cold breath. “Who is she?” Although Ning had
a guess, he still asked the question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Rainbowflame
Fairy, Yu Wei!” Bladeshadow spoke in a very soft voice. “She is a
reincarnated Immortal, and her talent is terrifyingly great. When she
had first entered the school, none of the old disciples chose to have
a Dao Debate with her! Her training speed is astonishing as well; she
is currently just over twenty years old, but her power has already
reached a frightening level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was inwardly
shocked. A reincarnated Immortal? His master had also told him that
there were only a total of three reincarnated Immortals amongst the
third generation disciples. Two had trained for over eighty years,
while one had been training for over twenty years. The one who had
been training for over twenty years was most likely this black-robed
woman, Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder she said
that she is the most powerful out of those who have comprehended
multiple Dao Domains,” Ning mused to himself in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, I’d like to help you, but I’m unable to.”
Bloodshadow immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if she is a
reincarnated Immortal? She’s just trained for ten or so more years
than I have, that’s all.” Although Ning was on high alert, he
didn’t feel the slightest bit of dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few moments
later. Ning was atop the stone pillar in the arena, under the grand
sealing barrier, and he was staring in astonishment at the scene
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had released a
thousand flying swords, which had combined to form the first stance
of the [Three-Foot Sword], and the power of this attack was truly
astonishing. But this Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei, had actually also
chosen the Thousandswords Golem, and had also released a thousand
flying swords, all of which had transformed into a sea of fiery sword
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A scorching sea of
fiery sword-light. A sharp, fierce sea of fiery sword-light. An
irresistible sea of fiery sword light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A head-on clash! A
frontal clash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s
sword-light was extremely sharp and extremely strong, that
all-devouring flame was even more berserk. It smashed apart Ning’s
sword-light, piercing past the protective armor of Ning’s
Thousandswords Golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei wins!” The
white-haired elder called out. It was a clean, straightforward win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost!” Ning rose
to his feet and laughed. “Senior apprentice-sister, you are
formidable. I whole-heartedly acknowledge my loss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I was sixteen,
I wasn’t as strong as you are.” The Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei,
gave Ning a glance. “Right. Don’t forget to give me those hundred
black-white pellets and those five kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at her,
instantly stupefied. He opened his mouth, but no words came out. Why
would an exalted reincarnated Immortal act as though she cared about
the wager that much? What, did she think that he was going to welch
on their bet?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the various
Primal Daoists had all arrived at the Dao Debate Palace. They made it
just in the nick of time, and were just barely able to catch the
sight of Ning battling against the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei. All of
them nodded inwardly. “He really is a Sword Immortal. And what a
powerful sword-heart! In a few centuries, our Black-White College
will most likely produce yet another Sword Immortal that is
comparable to Uncle-Master Diancai!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a corner of the Dao
Debate Palace. Whoosh! Whoosh! Two more Immortals had appeared next
to Immortal Fivecraze and Immortal Diancai. One was a bearded old man
with a crown on his head, while the other was a juvenile child who
radiated an aura of infinite cold. Their arrival had not been noticed
by any of the Primal Daoists or the third generation disciples within
the Dao Debate Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal!”
The crowned, bearded elder nodded as he spoke. “He has indeed
embarked onto the path of a Sword Immortal. Finally, our Black-White
College has yet another disciple who has begun to comprehend the
Grand Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daos were divided into
levels as well. Rainwater, ice, and whatnot; these were all just some
of the countless Daos of the natural world. But the Dao of the Sword,
however, was on a higher level; it was a ‘Grand Dao’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even gaining a basic
understanding of it was extremely difficult; Zifu Disciples would
generally find it quite easy to comprehend a hint of the True Meaning
of the Rainwater, and in fact, it wasn’t even that impressive for
them to comprehend a Rainwater Dao Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Dao of the
Sword, as one of the Grand Daos…even getting a basic understanding
of it was extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what a powerful
sword-heart. A sword-heart like that, talent like that, and
comprehension abilities like that…” The juvenile child’s voice
was quite youthful, but his words rang out in a manner that seemed
aged and sallow. “He is indeed a piece of unpolished jade that can
be sculpted into a mighty Sword Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right,
right.” The short elder nodded repeatedly. “Our Black-White
College currently only has a single Sword Immortal, junior
apprentice-brother Diancai. Now, we have another one. A Sword
Immortal! Even if he is defeated by the tribulations and ends up
becoming a Loose Immortal, he will still be one with astonishing
combat power, haha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crowned, bearded
elder instantly frowned and barked, “Senior apprentice-brother
Fivecraze, junior apprentice-brother Diancai is merely an Earth
Immortal right now. He has a very good chance of becoming a Celestial
Immortal. Don’t say such negative things at a time like this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder
immediately looked towards Immortal Diancai. “Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Immortal Diancai
just laughed calmly. “It’s fine. It’s enough so long as I act
in a way which is true to my heart. It is precisely as senior
Northwalker said; it is better to live passionately for a day, than
to live a century while stifled. All I need to do is continue moving
forward. Whether or not I can become a Celestial Immortal…that’s
secondary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well-spoken!” The
short elder nodded. As for the juvenile youth, he looked at Immortal
Diancai. “Junior apprentice-brother Diancai, Ji Ning is a second
Sword Immortal for our Black-White College. You must train him well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai turned
his head, staring at the distant Ji Ning, who was handing over jade
bottles to Yu Wei. An eager light appeared in his eyes, and he slowly
said, “That is to be expected. He is my disciple, after all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister. A hundred black-white pellets and five kilograms
of liquefied elemental essences. Here it is.” Ning handed the two
jade bottles to the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Yu Wei
glanced at Ning, a hint of amusement on her face. Stretching her arm
out, she snatched the bottles away from Ning, then turned and left.
