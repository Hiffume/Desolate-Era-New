Chapter 1 - The Culprit is Ji Ning!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man looked at
the golden-robed man. His voice was rather shrill, and his gaze was
filled with grief. “My child Nong died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch,
Youngflame Nong’s spirit-tablet has shattered,” the golden-robed
man said respectfully, not daring to show the slightest bit of
discourtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lishui, your master
has failed you.” Patriarch Arcanum shut his eyes, tears appearing
at the corner. Immortal Lishui was the female disciple who he had
loved the dearest; the two had identical dispositions, and Patriarch
Arcanum had all but viewed her as he would his own daughter.
Unfortunately, Immortal Lishui had been too arrogant when facing her
Celestial Tribulation, and in the end, her spirit had been destroyed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation was the greatest tribulation in any individual’s life.
Overcoming it meant becoming a carefree Celestial Immortal; failing
it, for the lucky, meant becoming a Loose Immortal, while the unlucky
would have their souls destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Lishui had
simply been too arrogant. At the last stage, she refused to give up,
and had chosen to continue to fight head on! And so…she died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum had
been griefstricken by this for an extremely long period of time.
Fortunately, Immortal Lishui had a son named Youngflame Nong.
Patriarch Arcanum had supported him from an early age, wanting to
make up for his failure with Immortal Lishui by taking care of
Youngflame Nong. He had given Youngflame Nong his full support this
entire time, and had insisted on pushing Youngflame Nong onto the
position of Godplume Duke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…Youngflame
Nong had died! Died at the Wanxiang level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I arranged a
Fiendgod to protect him. That Fiendgod should’ve been able to
withstand even a supreme Loose Immortal. How could he have died? How?
Who killed him?” Patriarch Arcanum revealed a look of explosive,
incomparably terrifying savagery in his eyes. “He was also carrying
the Greater Teleportation Dao-seal I gave him; even in a completely
different world, he would’ve been able to teleport straight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed man
said hurriedly, “Patriarch, Youngflame Nong should have died within
the Witchriver Immortal Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witchriver Immortal
Estate?” Patriarch Arcanum was instantly enraged. “Tests, tests,
always the stupid tests. What’s the big deal about becoming
Godplume Duke?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was angry,
Patriarch Arcanum knew that this was in accordance with the rules of
the clan; they couldn’t be easily discarded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the
Witchriver Immortal Estate?” Patriarch Arcanum asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within Stillwater
Commandery. I’ll lead the way for you, Patriarch,” the
golden-robed man said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Let’s go.”
Patriarch Arcanum gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the nine Flood
Dragons flew out, with that Immortal carriage behind them. Patriarch
Arcanum remained seated within, while the golden-robed man sat in the
front, in the position normally reserved for servants, carriage
drivers, and bodyguards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal carriage
soared into the skies, flying out off the volcano.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal estate had
been hidden in a separate world which was only connected to the Grand
Xia Dynasty’s world by a single corridor. If one did not know where
the connection point was, there would be no way to find the exact
location of the corridor, even if one was a Celestial Immortal. Thus,
one would naturally be unable to enter that world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the Youngflame
clan had arranged for Youngflame Nong to take his trials there, they
naturally had, early on, sent clan elders bearing the key to the
Immortal estate into the estate. They had done a quick surveillance,
assuring themselves that the ‘Witchriver Immortal Estate’ was a
place which would pose something of a challenge to Youngflame Nong,
but which absolutely couldn’t put him in mortal danger. Only then
did they bestow the key onto Youngflame Nong and have him come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why the
Youngflame clan had the precise location of the Witchriver Immortal
Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
Skyrove Mountains, there appeared an Immortal carriage that was
pulled by nine Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed man at
the front of the carriage pulled out and unfurled a scroll while
saying, “This scroll is of the Skyrove Mountains, and it also marks
the location where the Skyrove Mountains connects to the Witchriver
Immortal Estate. It’s right in front of us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They gave it a careful
glance and did a quick comparison. Soon, the Immortal carriage
arrived within the gorge. “Right there, on the walls of the gorge,”
the golden-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum,
seated within the carriage, had a very sinister look on his face. He
barked, “This cliff wall is enormous. Where, exactly, is the
connection point? The Witchriver Immortal Estate is in a separate
dimension; unless you can find the exact point, there’s no way to
enter it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, please
wait a moment.” The golden-robed man immediately executed a secret
art, causing a golden, glowing rune to appear in his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden rune began to
glow somewhere on the cliff wall as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right there. That’s
the place where the Witchriver Immortal Estate connects to our
world,” the golden-robed man said, pointing forward. “The clan
elders set a secret mark there long ago. That’s the mark.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open up.”
Patriarch Arcanum’s gaze turned incredibly sharp as he released his
full power. To forcibly break through the defenses of an Immortal
estate was no easy task. Spots of starlight began to appear in the
surrounding area. The countless specks of starlight seemed dreamlike
and illusory. At the same time, two giant hands of starlight began to
coalesce, then tore towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip. Space itself
tore apart, a corridor appearing. One could vaguely see through the
corridor that there was an Immortal estate world on the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one had not known
the exact connection location, however, the only result of this rip
would have been the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Witchriver
Immortal Estate? So it truly is here.” Patriarch Arcanum said
coldly, “Wait here then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
golden-robed man responded with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Patriarch
Arcanum rose to his feet, then took a single step which carried him
straight through the torn-open corridor and into the Immortal estate
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal estate
world was completely empty. With but a thought, Patriarch Arcanum
spread his sense out to cover the entire world, capable of
discovering everything within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There isn’t a
single living thing here?” Patriarch Arcanum was startled. But of
course, how could he know that when Ning fled, he had told the
monstrous races that there was a high chance a Celestial Immortal
would come. The monsters had been so terrified that the monstrous
Dao-soldiers had seized all of their kinsmen and pulled them onto
warships in quite a brutal and ruthless fashion, using all sorts of
cultivation techniques to quickly drag and send away one batch after
another. In but the time needed to boil a cup of tea, the entire
population of monsters had completely fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But those items in
those monstrous mountain lairs…those lake lairs…those
estates…there’s fruit and wine placed out in the open. Clearly,
they just left a short time ago.” Patriarch Arcanum turned his gaze
towards a nearby Skypillar of golden light. “The five palaces of
Immortal Witchriver. After my child Nong came, he definitely would’ve
entered one of these five palaces. Most likely, he died within one of
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step,
Patriarch Arcanum appeared before the Dao Repository Palace. He then
stretched out his finger and pointed towards the distance. “Temporal
Inversion!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Temporal
Inversion’ technique was an incomparably powerful technique.
Generally speaking, only Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals who had
incredibly profound insights into the Dao of Time were capable of
using it. If their insights were insufficient, then they would have
to wait until they surpassed the restrictions of the Three Realms and
became Celestial Immortals before they would be able to use this art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scenery in the area
began to change as time began to rapidly flow backwards. It flowed
all the way back to the point where Youngflame Nong used the Wildcore
and the ‘Lock’ scroll before just barely bypassing the monstrous
Dao-soldiers and entering the Dao Repository Palace. And then, time
began to progress forward at a normal pace. Soon, Youngflame Nong led
Ning and the others out of the Dao Repository Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My boy Nong entered
this palace, then left this palace; he didn’t die here.”
Patriarch Arcanum followed Youngflame Nong’s warship as it flew
forward. As he did so, the scene in the second location began to
replay once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong, Xue
Hongyi, Ji Ning, and the others rode the warship all the way to the
fifth palace, the Witchriver Palace, where the monsters had set up a
tight guard. Patriarch Arcanum just flew behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong used
the black and white disc, then immediately entered the fifth palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the monsters
were gathered here, rather than being dispersed in the other palaces.
My boy Nong, in turn, was willing to pay any price to enter this
palace. This should have been the final palace he entered.”
Patriarch Arcanum’s figure turned blurry for a moment, and then he
reappeared within the fifth palace, the Witchriver Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Witchriver
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum once
more used the Temporal Inversion technique, replaying the scene in
front of him, starting from when Youngflame Nong and the others
entered the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The breaking of the
illusory formation…the entering of the main hall…the celebratory
banquet…Ninelotus’ dance…Ji Ning’s anger…the attack of many
golems…Ji Ning using the Windwing Evasion…one scene after another
appeared. Even the dialogue was repeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Patriarch
Arcanum suddenly frowned. “That’s the Windwing Evasion!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, for the
sake of completing and perfecting their copy of this divine ability,
Patriarch Arcanum had personally soul-scoured some members of the
Yuchi clan; he naturally was quite familiar with the Windwing
Evasion. He immediately recognized that Ji Ning used the Windwing
Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scenes continued to
change at high speed. Youngflame Nong tried to force Ji Ning to cuff
himself with the godlock chains; Xue Hongyi then suddenly called out
that Ji Ning’s mother was named Yuchi Snow. Instantly, a major
battle began!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangliu Fang, by
himself, was able to block Mu Northson, Ninelotus, Yu Wei, and Adept
Vastriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi went to
fight Ji Ning. However…Ji Ning’s power suddenly increased
explosively, causing the entire hall to be filled with countless
swords. A single, dazzling sword-light executed Xue Hongyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Dao Domain?”
Patriarch Arcanum continued to watch, and as he did, his magical
power continued to rapidly deplete; Temporal Inversion, after all,
was no ordinary technique. “This kid named Ji Ning who knows the
Windwing Evasion, he’s only at the Wanxiang level. Even if he
comprehended a Grand Dao Domain, he should’ve been far from being a
match for the Fiendgod bodyguard my boy Nong had.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, Ning was
defeated by a single palm blow from Xiangliu Fang. But right at that
moment…that black loop had flown out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The souls of Youngflame
Nong, Xiangliu Fang, and the Redscale Salamander were all devoured
and extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this, this
is…” Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes were filled with shock and rage.
“A Soulslayer Loop? How could this kid have possibly procured such
a treasure? Can it be that a major power died during one of the huge,
chaotic battles of the Fiendgod Era, and the Soulslayer Sphere ended
up as a relic somewhere, where the kid found it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luck. It was hard to
say what luck might bring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A backwater bumpkin
might be lucky enough to acquire a heaven-defying treasure! In fact,
a lucky kid who offered an old man a bowl of water might end up
finding that the old man was one of the major powers of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child Nong didn’t
have bad luck, but he actually ended up dying to this Ji Ning of the
Black-White College. For this Ji Ning to have procured such a
treasure…it seems he must have been blessed with tremendous luck.
However, no matter how lucky he might be, he won’t be able to
overcome my divine abilities.” Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes became
filled with a cold light. “Those survivors were Yu Wei, Mu
Northson, Vastriver, and Ninelotus; all of them are disciples of the
Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black-White
College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
turned, once more ripping a corridor through space, at the point
where the estate was linked with the outside world of the Grand Xia
Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Skyrove
Mountains. The golden-robed man had been waiting here the entire
time, only to see Patriarch Arcanum tear a corridor through space and
emerge through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch,” the
golden-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The culprit was Ji
Ning of the Black-White College.” Patriarch Arcanum looked at him.
“Do you know him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed man
was the Godplume Duke; how could he possibly know about one
particular genius within Stillwater Commandery? He immediately shook
his head. “I do not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s go
straight to Stillwater City. First, we’ll do a thorough
investigation regarding Ji Ning at the Heavenly Treasures Mountain;
then, we shall go to the Black-White College! Those other disciples
are most likely still within the Black-White College,” Patriarch
Arcanum instructed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
golden-robed man immediately commanded the Immortal carriage to
leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Flood Dragons
pulled the Immortal carriage, quickly departing from the Skyrove
Mountains. They flew through the skies, heading towards Stillwater
City.

Chapter 2 - The Eight Loose Immortals of the Black-White College
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the skies above
Stillwater City. There were nine Flood Dragons, pulling an Immortal
carriage behind them, which had come to a halt above the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, wait
here. I will go investigate Ji Ning in detail,” the Godplume Duke
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, Ji Ning’s
mother is named Yuchi Snow; purchase an intelligence report on her as
well.” Patriarch Arcanum remained seated aboard the Immortal
carriage as he calmly gave the orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke
immediately flew down into the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Just a
short while later, the Godplume Duke walked out from within it. With
a blurring movement, he flew back into the sky, next to Patriarch
Arcanum, respectfully handing him a book with two characters on it -
JI NING.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just Ji Ning’s?”
Patriarch Arcanum frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s mother,
Yuchi Snow, was a minor Xiantian lifeform who hadn’t accomplished
any major deeds; the only record of her is that she had a son named
Ji Ning. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain informed me that there is
virtually no intelligence regarding Yuchi Snow, and all of what they
have is in this tome,” the Godplume Duke explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
nodded softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain’s intelligence unit was spread throughout the
world, they weren’t as all-knowing as the heavens themselves. They,
too, needed to engage in deep, careful investigations in order to
find things out. Yuchi Snow and her family’s flight was a very
secretive thing to begin with; even the Youngflame clan hadn’t been
able to catch these final few fish who had fled their net. It wasn’t
strange for the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to be unaware of it as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning? He’s
actually this young?” Patriarch Arcanum, upon seeing the report,
was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His beloved Youngflame
Nong had trained for more than a century. Amongst Wanxiang Adepts,
that was actually quite young, because Wanxiang Adepts could live for
up to eight hundred years. Unexpectedly, this kid who had killed the
Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang as well as Youngflame Nong, this kid who had
already reached the Grand Dao Domain level in the Dao of the Sword,
was actually this young!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more impressive
his potential, the more he needs to die!” A cold light flashed
through Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes. He quickly flipped through the
report, finishing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swallow Mountain?
Serpentwing Lake?” Patriarch Arcanum hummed to himself, then
instructed, “Come, let’s go to the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had made thorough preparations long ago. Mu Northson, Yu Wei, and
Adept Vastriver had used the closest teleportation array to first go
straight to the Crimson Dragon Mountains, and then from those
mountains to Stillwater City; they had moved fairly quickly, and as
soon as they had returned to the Black-White College, they had
immediately reported this event to the higher-ups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Headmaster’s
Palace of the Black-White College. This was also the place where they
welcomed important guests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace were
multiple seated figures. On one side of the palace sat the
black-robed, black-haired Immortal Diancai, along with Immortal
Fivecraze and the rest of the Immortals. There were a total of eight
of them. Behind them stood Headmaster Jadesea and three of the
third-generation disciples; Rainbowflame Fairy Yu Wei, Adept
Vastriver, and Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of them sat
Patriarch Arcanum and the Godplume Duke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you all
know why I have come here today.” Patriarch Arcanum sat there and
spoke calmly as he swept his gaze across the group of Immortals
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight Loose Immortals
and Earth Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Virtually all of the
Loose Immortals of the Black-White College who were normally in
closed-door meditation, in seclusion, or adventuring had returned.
Aside from a single Loose Immortal who had already left this major
world and wouldn’t be able to make it back in time, the other eight
had all returned. The Immortal cultivators of the Black-White College
were all absolute elites; they all had mastered a complete Dao-Path,
which was a prerequisite for them even reaching the Primal Daoist
level. Only after mastering two Dao-Paths, however, were they
permitted to break through to the Earth Immortal level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is why the Primal
Daoists of the Black-White College were comparable to Loose Immortals
in combat power. As for the Loose Immortals of the Black-White
College…each of them were capable of fending off ten ‘normal’
Loose Immortals. Each of them had the combat power of a supreme Loose
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we know.”
The short old man, Immortal Fivecraze, chuckled as he spoke.
“Youngflame Nong of your Youngflame clan was killed by our
disciple, Ji Ning, correct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct.”
Patriarch Arcanum replied calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he died, he died.
When young people are out adventuring, it’s normal for them fight
and kill each other. If you are weaker than someone else, you die.
That’s normal,” the short elder said. “If you have to blame
someone, you can only blame yourself for being too weak. Generally
speaking, the clans and sects won’t intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains; Ning’s group had often fought
internally and quite a few had died, but no sect had ever come for
reprisal against another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
gaze instantly changed. It became sharp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, if you,
senior Arcanum, doted on this Youngflame Nong to the point where you
would lower yourself to personally attack Ji Ning, there’s nothing
our Black-White College can do about it.” The short elder sighed,
“So…I really don’t understand why, senior Arcanum, you have
come to our Black-White College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over Ji Ning,”
Patriarch Arcanum said coldly, “And this matter will have nothing
to do with your Black-White College. Otherwise…hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the faces of
the Immortals of the Black-White College changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hand over Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it!” The
black-robed, black-haired Immortal Diancai snapped coldly, “Ji Ning
is a disciple of our Black-White College. If he were to die while
adventuring in the outside world, we wouldn’t blame others…but
you want us to hand him over? Are you dreaming? And, let me tell you
something - so long as Ji Ning returns to the Black-White College,
your Youngflame clan can forget about harming a single hair on his
head.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Arcanum, we
respect you as a Celestial Immortal, but our Black-White College,
which has existed for so many generations, isn’t so easily abused
either,” the short, elderly Immortal Fivecraze warned coldly as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Black-White
College has our own rules; if our disciples die while adventuring, we
won’t blame others, but once they return, then they will absolutely
be protected by us.” The tall, muscular man wrapped up in chain
links spoke out in a loud, rumbling voice, his eyes seemed to be
filled with thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
face sank. “Oh, so your Black-White College wishes to become
enemies with my Youngflame clan.” Patriarch Arcanum swept these
Immortals with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan
was, indeed, powerful. It was much more powerful than even the
Northmont clan of Stillwater. It had more than a thousand Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals; from this, one could imagine how
mighty they were! However, just because they were powerful didn’t
mean they could freely abuse other powers; for example, the
Black-White College was located within Stillwater City. Who would
dare launch a massive attack within Stillwater City? There would only
be one result - becoming wanted criminals of the Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for fighting in the
outside world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Loose
Immortal of the Black-White College was top-tier; each of them were
capable of fighting against ten Loose Immortals! If they completely
focused on fleeing, it would be very hard to deal with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t that we
wish to become enemies with you; rather, your Youngflame clan is
forcing us to become enemies. If our Black-White College can’t even
protect our own disciples, what the hell type of College would we
be?” Immortal Diancai replied coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case!” Patriarch Arcanum coldly rose to his feet. “Then don’t
blame the Youngflame clan for our future actions. Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Patriarch.”
The Godplume Duke followed by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just as Patriarch
Arcanum was about to lead the Godplume Duke to leave, a voice
suddenly rang out. “Brother Arcanum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hunchbacked old man
suddenly walked in. His hair was completely white, and his eyebrows
drooped downwards. He was leaning against a wooden cane as he walked
in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
momentarily startled. Then, he let out a cold laugh. “Hunchmont?
You are still alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t died
yet; how could I?” The hunchbacked old man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Loose
Immortals of the Black-White College all rose to their feet and
saluted respectfully. Celestial Immortal Hunchmont…he was one of
the most famous Celestial Immortal Patriarchs in the history of the
Northmont clan. However, because he had lived for so very long, many
outside schools and sects thought him to be dead; after all,
Celestial Immortals would occasionally engage in battles against each
other for the sake of their tribe or for certain treasures. After
many battles, some would eventually fall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College belongs to our Stillwater Commandery.” The hunchbacked
elder leaned against his cane. “Arcanum, if you want to deal with
their disciples, there is nothing they can do to stop you; why must
you force the Black-White College to hand Ji Ning over? If you have
the ability to do so, go ahead and deal with him yourself; our
Northmont clan absolutely won’t interfere. But if you were to deal
against the Black-White College, you would be stepping beyond your
bounds! Stillwater Commandery belongs to the Northmont clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
face sank. Although the Youngflame clan was even more powerful than
the Northmont clan, there was a limit to their strength; the
Northmont clan held a marquisdom, and it had existed since the
Fiendgod Era as well. After the passage of so many years…who knew
how many trump cards the Northmont clan of Stillwater might be
holding in secret?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Since you,
Hunchmont, have spoken out…” Patriarch Arcanum nodded. “Then I
won’t quibble with the Black-White College. However, this Ji
Ning…he absolutely must die! If anyone tries to stop me, I’ll
kill them as well! Fujun, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum led
the Godplume Duke out of the Headmaster’s Palace. They boarded the
Immortal carriage, then quickly flew into the skies and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Huchmont.”
Immortal Fivecraze walked over, watching as Patriarch Arcanum flew
away aboard the Immortal carriage. “This Patriarch Arcanum seems to
be a bit too arrogant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s just the
way he is. He’s like a madman.” The hunchbacked elder laughed.
“Don’t worry about him. But that Ji Ning of yours…you had best
not interfere. Given how murderous Patriarch Arcanum seems to be
feeling right now, you won’t be able to stop him. Alright, it is
time for me to go. Such a pity. Ji Ning was a fine young sapling.
What a pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the
hunchbacked elder left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within another world.
The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just appeared
within the main hall. He immediately saw the giant yellow bear and
the old black bull.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors,” Ning was
about to speak out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You caused a huge
mess in the outside world, eh?” The giant yellow bear said, “You
were in such a frantic hurry to order all of the people off of
Brightheart Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did cause a huge
mess, yes,” Ning said hurriedly. “I have…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
interrupted Ning. “Let me ask you this; have you completed your
arrangements in the outside world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The giant
yellow bear nodded. “I can sense the turbulence in your heart. Your
mind is currently in a state of chaos. First, go to the Stellar Hall
and read some of the star maps within it. After reading a few books
and calming yourself down, come and speak to me regarding your
matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
“Read in the Stellar Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” the giant
yellow bear instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, senior.” Ning
didn’t disobey. He went straight to the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Stellar
Hall. Outside the thatched cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carried a book to
the stone desk, then sat down, opened it up, and began to force
himself to calm down and read. He had first killed Youngflame Nong,
then separated with Ninelotus, and then arrange for the monsters of
the Immortal estate to protect his clan. Whenever Ning thought about
the impending arrival of the Youngflame clan, Ning’s mind would
become filled with a myriad of random thoughts, causing him to feel
extremely restless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, Chang came to
pay his respects to me…” Ning’s voice reverberated within this
small pocket world. Every single word was extremely simple, but when
joined together, they became filled with boundless magical power. In
a very natural way, Ning began to calm down; in fact, he even began
to slowly enter a state of attunement and meditation on the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Relaxation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The restlessness in
Ning’s heart faded away, and Ning raised his head to stare at the
stars in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…rain began
to fall down from the skies, as fine as silk, sprinkling everywhere,
including upon Ning himself.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - Mastering the First Dao-Path
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The downpour steadily
grew, and it poured down into this world. Ji Ning didn’t move to
avoid it, nor did he use his elemental ki to block it; he allowed the
rain to cascade onto his body. He felt closer to the raindrops than
he ever had before, so close that he felt intoxicated by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A nameless aura began
to envelope Ning. This was the aura of the Dao! Ning’s entire body
seemed to have become the Dao itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of
Rainwater?” The giant yellow bear and the old black bull were both
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
mastered it. Although Ning has made major improvements in the ten
years he spent at Serpentwing Lake, and had an extremely deep grasp
regarding the Dao of Rainwater, he was still some distance away from
mastering it. Generally speaking, when comprehending the Dao, the
farther along the path you go, the more difficult it will become.
What in the world has Ji Ning experienced? Whatever it was, it seems
to have baptized him, allowing him to break through and completely
understand the Dao of Rainwater at one go.” The giant yellow bear
sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
nodded as well. . “Whatever it was he experienced, it had a
tremendous impact on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainwater vanished.
Ning stared at the stars in the sky. He had advanced in the Dao of
the Inferno, the Dao of the Gale, and the Dao of the Sword as well.
His understanding of the Dao of the Sword in particular, which had
reached the Grand Dao Domain, had further stabilized after this
period of time of time in the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, he came to a
halt and rested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much time did I
spend in meditation?” Ning spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not too long, just
an hour.” The giant yellow bear laughed, “But in this hour, you
improved quite a bit; you surged forward tremendously in one breath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt more peaceful
than he ever had before. He revealed a hint of a smile. “I can
sense my improvement as well. I have thoroughly comprehended the Dao
of Rainwater, and in fact, I have gained a certain degree of insight
into all ‘water’-type Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is called
resonance,” the giant yellow bear said. “You have now mastered
the Dao-Path of Rainwater; naturally, you will continue to advance in
the element of water. For the other, similar Daos to resonate is
quite normal. Unfortunately, although you advanced a bit in the Dao
of the Inferno and the Dao of the Gale, you are still a little ways
off from completely mastering these Dao-Paths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of his three Daos, he
had gained insights into the Dao of Rainwater the earliest, and his
level of comprehension with regards to this Dao was the highest. His
insights into the Dao of the Inferno was secondary only to the Dao of
Rainwater, and was actually quite close; however, he still had yet to
completely master it. As for the Dao of the Gale, it was weaker than
both the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that you’d actually be able to master a Grand Dao Domain.” The
giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “Sword Immortals are all skilled
at offense; it’s clear that your strength has risen significantly
after you reached the Grand Dao Domain. Now that you’ve also
mastered the Dao-Path of Rainwater, you will be absolutely capable of
fusing your Dao of Rainwater into your Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword
was a mechanistic Dao. One could infuse one’s insights in other
areas into the Dao of the Sword and display it through the sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try.” Ning
laughed, then struck out with a finger into a sword-stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, rainwater
appeared in the surrounding area. The rainwater sprinkled everywhere,
but each drop of water carried an incomparably amazing amount of
power. The entire world seemed to have been frozen into place. An
ordinary Wanxiang Adept probably wouldn’t even be able to move
right now. After completely mastering a Dao-Path, one would be able
to summon the awesome presence of the Dao itself, causing the entire
surrounding area to be under one’s own control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique is
called ‘My Own World’. Activate.” Ning suddenly flicked his
finger. Swish! A streak of watery sword-light sliced through the
skies, leaving behind a scar in the air that lingered for quite some
time without vanishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A good technique;
truly, a good sword technique,” the giant yellow bear praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not just
good; even Loose Immortals are generally only at this level, and many
aren’t as good as you, Ji Ning,” the old black bull called out in
surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Generally
speaking, Primal Daoists were at the Dao Domain level, while Loose
Immortals were generally capable of mastering a complete Dao-Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had not only
mastered a completely Dao-Path, he had also reached the Grand Dao
Domain level in the Dao of the Sword. It was even harder to reach the
Grand Dao Domain level than mastering a complete Dao-Path. With the
two amplifying each other…indeed, many Loose Immortals were
inferior to Ning. However, that only referred to ‘ordinary’ Loose
Immortals, not ones like the Loose Immortals of the Black-White
College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am now in control
of a complete Dao-Path. According to the rules of the College, I can
make my breakthrough to the Primal Daoist level,” Ning said. “In
addition, after having killed a young master of a major tribe, I’ve
reaped quite a few rewards; I imagine I should now have enough
liquefied elemental essence to make that breakthrough. Only, I’m
still hesitating; should I make that breakthrough or not? I’d like
to ask you two seniors to please advise me on what I should do next.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull had
accompanied Immortal Juhua for a million years, and had a great deal
of experience. Naturally, his vision would be very broad as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the giant yellow
bear, he had followed Daoist Threelives and had unfathomable
experiences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt that he truly
should ask the advice of these two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” The giant
yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this? You
killed a young master of a major clan? Tell, tell,” the old black
bull said with great eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I was
originally training in Brightheart Island on Serpentwing Lake, but a
few days ago, a large warship suddenly appeared in the skies above
it…” Ning began to describe his experience in detail, from start
to finish. He even explained the backgrounds of Youngflame Nong and
Ninelotus, so as to give these two old figures sufficient background
information for pondering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He even told them about
Yu Wei’s advice and the upcoming Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
is going to pursue me. What should I do?” Ning looked at the old
black bull and the giant yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major tribe that
can rank amongst the top ten clans of one of the three thousand major
worlds…this sort of tribe definitely has Celestial Immortals,”
the giant yellow bear said. “In addition, they should have more
than just one. A force like this…for the current you, they are
indeed far too powerful. Fortunately, in the Grand Xia Dynasty, there
are strict laws, which is why you still have a chance to resist
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan?
I know this clan,” the old black bull said hurriedly. “In the
past, Immortal Juhua had a bit of a relationship with the clan. The
Youngflame clan does indeed rank towards the front amongst the clans
of the Grand Xia Dynasty. However, although the imperial clan of the
Grand Xia did indeed need these clans when it was unifying the world,
after doing so, these clans became a threat to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth, the
imperial clan of the Grand Xia has been working all this time to try
and weaken the power of the clans,” the old black bull said
quickly. “They first built the commandery cities, spreading them
throughout the world so as to increase their sphere of control, and
then formed the Raindragon Guard and spread them throughout the world
as well! In addition, they secretly forment internal struggles
between these clans, tribes, and sects.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that the
other tribes are idiots? They’ll just stupidly fight amongst each
other like that?” Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is what you
don’t understand. This isn’t a hidden scheme; it’s an open
scheme. There is only so much land in this major world, and only so
many treasures. And yet, there are so many tribes. What to do about
it? The imperial clan of the Grand Xia will take their share, then
leave the other major powers to fight over what’s left. If you
aren’t willing to fight for your share, then your clan will end up
with no treasures. Thus, they are forced to struggle against each
other, and as they do, they naturally end up forming grudges.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the
imperial clan of the Grand Xia wouldn’t dare to act directly
against its marquises. That’s because if they were to act against
one marquis, all of the other marquises would feel threatened; in
fact, some actually might join forces to revolt!” The old black
bull continued, “This is why the imperial clan of the Grand Xia has
set down some laws, some public laws.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as you do
not disobey the laws, the imperial clan absolutely won’t touch
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if you were to
violate those laws? The imperial clan of the Grand Xia would be like
sharks that smelled the scent of blood; they will eat you alive,”
the old black bull laughed. “So long as you hide within a
commandery city, the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan
definitely won’t dare to act against you, because once they do,
then the imperial clan of the Grand Xia, which has always wanted to
whittle away at the power of the marquises, will have an ironclad
reason to act against them. They would quickly send out a squad to
annihilate that Celestial Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, do you
understand some of the hidden undercurrents of this world of the
Grand Xia Dynasty’s?” The old black bull looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial clan of
the Grand Xia, and the many marquises.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the marquises
held grudges against each other; no wonder Yu Wei had advised him to
join a different marquisdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei of yours told you to go participate in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Her words are quite correct,” the
giant yellow bear said. “You are going to become a Celestial
Immortal, and in fact, an Empyrean God…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, what is an
‘Empyrean God’?” Ning immediately asked. Ning had never quite
understood what Empyrean Gods were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Earth
Immortals, who are at the ‘Void’ level, overcome the Celestial
Tribulation, they will naturally become carefree Celstial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void-level
Fiendgods, however, when overcoming the Celestial Tribulation will
become Empyrean Gods!” The giant yellow bear said, “To become an
Empyrean God is tens of times, perhaps a hundred times, as difficult
as becoming a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. “A
hundred times harder?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was rare for there
to be even a single Celestial Immortal for every ten thousand Earth
Immortals; to become an Empyrean God was even harder?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because
they have completely different levels of power,” the giant yellow
bear explained. “Earlier, you said you encountered a Fiendgod, a
Hydraga. He was only at the Primal level, but already comparable to a
peak Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.’ Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Void-level
Fiendgod is already comparable to a Celestial Immortal. And an
Empyrean God…they are absolutely comparable to True Immortals!”
The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “Now do you understand? Once
you become an Empyrean God…you would become a true major power of
the Three Realms. In fact, even if you were to go to the Deva realm
and express a desire to join the Celestial Court, the Celestial
Emperor would warmly welcome you and even let you command hundreds of
thousands of celestial soldiers or generals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. The
Celestial Emperor of the Celestial Court would personally welcome
him? Let him command hundreds of thousands of celestial soldiers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master said that
only after I become an Empyrean God would I truly be considered his
apprentice.” Ning couldn’t help but say, “This requirement is a
bit high for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think about what
Master’s status was. He emerged from the world alongside Pangu and
Nuwa…he was one of the most supreme powers of the entire Three
Realms. Only after reaching the Empyrean God level could it be said
that you are not an embarrassment to him,” the giant yellow bear
said. “But don’t change the subject. As I was saying earlier, the
advice from your senior apprentice-sister, Yu Wei, to go to the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny was very good advice. This is because,
as the saying goes, it is better to travel ten thousand kilometers
than to read ten thousand books…and it is better to make a single
journey on the border between life and death than to travel ten
thousand kilometers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny will have all the geniuses of this entire major
world present; in fact, some of the geniuses of other major worlds
might come in secret as well, so as to take part.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just like
the cultivation of Gu-bugs. Put ten thousand venomous bugs in one
place and have them fight against each other and devour each other.
In the end, the venomous bugs that you have left will be incomparably
powerful. The principle is the same; the ones to survive the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny shall be truly extraordinary. This is an
excellent chance for you to temper yourself, a chance which is quite
rare and hard to find.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
continued, “Right, you said you killed Youngflame Nong; didn’t
you acquire a great deal of treasure from him? Take it out, take it
all out and let me take a look and see which would be of use to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
“He had many treasures. I just bound the storage-type magic
treasure not long ago.” He had been hiding some of the treasures
within his Zifu, while he had stored the others in his own
storage-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a small hill
appeared on the ground, completely formed from precious items and
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
treasures and precious items of Youngflame Nong.” Ning pointed at
them.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Primaltwin"></A>
Chapter 4 - Primaltwin
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand
again, and another hill of items appeared as well, as well as some
sacks. “These were left behind by that dead Fiendgod.” The
Hydraga had once forced himself to train as a Ki Refiner as well.
Unfortunately, natural Fiendgods were innately very weak as Ki
Refiners. Only after many years of painstaking training had he
reached the Zifu level; afterwards, Xiangliu Fang could no longer be
bothered to train in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reaching the Zifu
level, he was able to use storage-type magic treasures, at least.
This was enough to make Xiangliu Fang quite happy! In the Fiendgod
Era, before he had trained as a Ki Refiner, he always had to carry
around his treasures with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s quite a
bit.” The old black bull sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
The giant yellow bear swept his gaze across the magic treasures.
Suddenly, the two treasure-hills all flew into the air, then stayed
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These treasures quickly
began to sort themselves out by type. Bottles and jars moved to one
side, while Dao-seals and jade discs, as well as some other unique
items were pulled to another. The many magic treasures were also
placed on another side…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simply watched as
the levitating treasures sorted themselves out by type. “I didn’t
sense any ripples of power, but these treasures all levitated into
the air; the powers of this spirit of the underwater estate truly are
unfathomable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
spirit-pill; if you lose an arm or a leg, eat the pill, and it’ll
be healed. You are a Fiendgod Refiner; this is useless to you. Go
back and sell it off or give it to a friend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a poison
powder…it’s hard to ascertain how powerful the poison is, but it
should be decent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This bottle is
marked with the words, ‘Drunken Immortal’s Pill’? Eh? Its
intoxicating properties are quite strong; I imagine that even if
Loose Immortals ate it, they would be intoxicated. Three pills in
total.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
quickly went through the various jars and bottles. Soon, he pulled
out two of the jade bottles from the masses. “These two bottles
both contain liquefied elemental essence, roughly twenty five
thousand kilograms each, for a total of fifty thousand kilograms.
Youngflame Nong actually carried fifty thousand kilograms on
him…that’s quite a bit.” Unless they were in desperate need,
most Immortal cultivators wouldn’t carry that much with them. They
would use them to buy magic treasures or just use them up. However,
to Youngflame Nong, fifty thousand kilograms wasn’t that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must’ve been
worried that he might gain a sudden insight while wandering the
world, and so prepared them for a possible breakthrough to the Primal
Daoist level,” Ning laughed. Fifty thousand kilograms; this was
absolutely enough to break through to the Primal Daoist level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You cannot use it.”
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “You are going to the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny; you cannot breakthrough to become a
Primal Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood this principle. This Conclave came only once every three
centuries; there was no way he could wait another three hundred
years. Thus, this was the only chance he would have to attend the
Conclave. Sparring against so many other geniuses on the same level
was an opportunity that would have long, far-ranging impacts on him.
If one didn’t have a long-term plan and only focused on short-term
gains, in the end, one would suffer for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These curios aren’t
bad either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? A Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal? Youngflame Nong had a Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal?” The giant yellow bear called out in surprise as he
pointed with a finger. Instantly, a rune-covered leaf flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
“Greater Teleportation Dao-seal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had previously
acquired two protective items from the underwater estate; one was
that black loop, while the other was, in fact, a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was meant for
attack; the other was meant for defense and escaping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon using a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal, the might within it would instantly activate
and surround him in a barrier which even Loose Immortals wouldn’t
be able to break. And then, he would vanish and disappear. Even if
the region was spacelocked, even if he was trapped in a place of no
escape, he could still use a Greater Teleport to leave! He could even
teleport from a different world directly to the world of the Grand
Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You now have two
Greater Teleportation Dao-seals.” The giant yellow bear flicked his
finger, sending the leaf flying towards Ning. Laughing, Ning waved
his hand and accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong
truly was unfortunate to run into you. His soul was immediately
ripped out, giving him no chance to even use the Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal.” The giant yellow bear continued to
investigate. “There’s quite a few protective treasures as well.
There’s a Vajra-Guard Skypearl, a Golden Skyfire seal, a Skyflee
shuttle…still, these are quite inferior compared to a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Nong
actually had three major treasures; the ‘Lock’ scroll, the black
and white disc, and the Greater Teleportation Dao-seal. He had used
up two of them. The plan had been to bind the Immortal estate, sell
the monstrous Dao-soldiers of the estate to his clan, then use those
resources to purchase some truly top-tier treasures. Unfortunately,
he would never have the chance to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bro, take a
look; isn’t that the Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater?” The old black
bull suddenly pointed to a watery pearl which hovered in the mass of
precious items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Sole-Ki Pearl of
Elemental Water?” The giant yellow bear hurriedly looked over. His
eyes lit up, and he began to laugh loudly. “Ning, you little tyke,
it seems it is indeed time for you to reach the Primal level. With
this Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater, you can now cultivate a
Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning called out in
surprise, “A Primaltwin?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, Ning knew
what a Primaltwin was; virtually all cultivators knew what it was! In
the Black-White College, the technique for forming a Primaltwin was
something which every single disciple could learn. There was no need
for using black-white pellets at all. It was something for everyone
to know, but unfortunately, less than one in a thousand Primal
Daoists would actually be able to refine a Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…it
was too hard to find the right vessel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a cultivator broke
through from the Wanxiang stage to the Primal stage, the essence of
the myriad manifestations of stars and the elemental sea within the
Zifu region would crystallize and give birth to a Turtle-Snake 1. At
the same time, the soul would descend from the sea of consciousness
and sink deep into the Turtle-Snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they fused into
one…the Primal Turtle-Snake would be formed! With the Primal
Turtle-Snake serving as a physical vessel, and the soul serving as
the self, a Primal Daoist would arise from the fusion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to refine a
Primaltwin, one would need to find a physical vessel; once one found
it, one would use a secret art to split one’s soul in two, keeping
half the soul in the original body and placing the other half within
the vessel and forming a Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This Sole-Ki
Pearl of Primalwater is like a natural Zifu region,” the giant
yellow bear laughed. “All you need to do is split out part of your
soul and place it within the pearl, and you’ll be able to slowly
refine it into a Primaltwin! In fact, in the future your Primaltwin
would even be able to become an Earth Immortal and perhaps surpass
the tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never even
heard of a ‘Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater’; in the annals of the
Black-White College regarding Primaltwins, the most famous vessel was
the ‘Darkvalley Pearl’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it compared
to the Darkvalley Pearl?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Darkvalley Pearl
is too mediocre,” the giant yellow bear said. “A Sole-Ki Pearl of
Primalwater contains the essence of primal, elemental water. After
you fuse your soul into it and form your Primaltwin, your body will
be formed from the essence of primal water as well. By then, when you
use it to train in water-type Daos, you will find it much simpler. It
seems as though you are destined to travel very far in the element of
water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of Rainwater
was nothing more than an extremely unremarkable type of Dao that
belonged to the element of water, one of the Five Elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is your soul? Is
it capable of withstanding a Primaltwin secret art?” The giant
yellow bear asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To divide a soul in
half was extremely dangerous. The soul had to be sufficiently strong;
if it wasn’t, then dividing it in half was akin to suicide! Thus,
generally speaking, only Primal Daoists who had been at that stage
for a very long time or experts who had already reached the Void
level and become Earth Immortals would be able to produce a
Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine sense
stretches to a thousand kilometers,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. There are very
few Primal Daoists who have souls comparable to yours; you can
compare to a weak Loose Immortal.” The giant yellow bear nodded.
“You can split your soul in half.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a fire begin
to blaze in his heart. To produce a Primaltwin at the Wanxiang level;
this was far too rare. First of all, the soul had to be strong
enough; then, one had to have a vessel, such as the ‘Darkvalley
Pearl’ or the ‘Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater’. Thus, for every
thousand recinarnated Immortals, perhaps only one would be able to
produce a Primaltwin at the Wanxiang stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why only
those below the Primal stage were allowed to participate in the
contests of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny was to ensure fairness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning might
have refined a Primaltwin, his true body remained at the Wanxiang
level. So long as it was only his true body which went to compete,
and his Primaltwin stayed out of it…there would be no problems!
Ning had already chatted previously with Yu Wei regarding the
Conclave, and so he naturally knew about some of the rules of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only geniuses amongst
geniuses would be capable of producing Primaltwins at the Wanxiang
level; naturally, they wouldn’t be barred from participating in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. However, they would only be allowed to
use their true bodies to compete; in fact, their Primaltwins wouldn’t
even be permitted to enter the competition grounds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The giant
yellow bear frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial Immortal
has come to Serpentwing Lake,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal?”
Ning was shocked. “It must be the Youngflame clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I can
discover him, but he can’t discover me.” The giant yellow bear
said calmly, “Master spent unfathomable amounts of blood, sweat,
and effort in order to forge me. There is no one in the entire Grand
Xia Dynasty capable of discovering me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already dark.
Nine Flood Dragons, pulling an Immortal carriage behind them, had
appeared in the skies. Aboard the Immortal carriage sat Patriarch
Arcanum, with the Godplume Duke attending to him by the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the place
where Ji Ning is permanently stationed?” Patriarch Arcanum, with
but a single thought, was able to scan this entire region.
Brightheart Island was now completely empty; not a single person was
present. However, there were still a few people on boats who were
sailing aboard Serpentwing Lake. These were ordinary mortals. Given
how large Serpentwing Lake was, it would take them a tremendous
amount of time to pass through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They fled?” A
baleful look appeared in Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes. “Kill those
mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them?” The
Godplume Duke hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Heavens
was protective of mortals. For Immortal cultivators to kill mortals
was a grave sin. Even someone like Patriarch Arcanum, who wanted to
kill these mortals, wasn’t willing to personally kill them and
cause sin to surround him. Even Celestial Immortals would see their
luck plummet, and as their luck plummeted…they would run into all
sorts of trouble. If Celestial Immortals had sufficiently bad luck,
they might end up dying in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why aren’t you
acting yet?” Patriarch Arcanum gave the Godplume Duke a sidelong
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Godplume Duke gritted his teeth, then looked at the nine Flood
Dragons pulling the Immortal carriage. He sent a spirit-message:
“Kill the mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although none of the
nine Flood Dragons wanted to obey, they still all opened their
mouths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine streaks of fire
descended, instantly sweeping through the entire lake. The commoners
on the lake’s surface were all shocked and terrified for a
moment…and then they transformed into ash. Tendrils of sin
instantly descended, with some swirling around the bodies of those
nine Flood Dragons, and the rest swirling around the Godplume Duke. A
very small amount of sin ended up swirling around Patriarch Arcanum
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
City of Ten Thousand Swords.” Patriarch Arcanum gave the order, and
the nine Flood Dragons pulled the Immortal carriage away, quickly
arriving at the City of Ten Thousand Swords, just a few thousand
kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The City of Ten
Thousand Swords remained as it always had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum did a
quick inspection. His face immediately changed. “There are this
many monstrous Dao-soldiers here? Hrm? Ji Ning’s master, that Sword
Immortal known as Diancai, he is here as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Patriarch
Arcanum’s temper was volatile, but he knew that there was nothing
he could do to this city. He immediately ordered coldly, “Fujun,
arrange for the City of Ten Thousand Swords, Western Prefecture City
and Serpentwing Lake be under constant watch! This is the homeland of
Ji Ning’s clan; I refuse to believe he will never return. Also, ask
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to keep a close watch on Ji Ning.
Upon discovering his whereabouts, immediately inform our Youngflame
clan. No matter where he is hiding, once we discover him, immediately
send people to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the Godplume
Duke said respectfully.
</P>

Chapter 5 - Immortal Diancai and Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We
return to the imperial capital!” Patriarch Arcanum gave the order.
Immediately, those nine Flood Dragons pulled the Immortal carriage
away, disappearing into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was a
decisive individual. He knew that given that he hadn’t discovered
Ji Ning right away, if he wanted to capture Ning…he would have to
spend quite a bit of time. Although he was a Celestial Immortal, he
wasn’t omniscient; he still had to resort to using the power of the
tribe and the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to find Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the City of Ten
Thousand Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai lifted
his head, watching as Patriarch Arcanum departed. By his side were Ji
Truekeep, Ji Ninfire, and the other members of the Ji clan, along
with the two monstrous Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader Ji,”
Immortal Diancai said, “Patriarch Arcanum has already departed. He
wasn’t able to find my apprentice, but he won’t stay here
indefinitely; he’s a Celestial Immortal, after all, with an exalted
status! However, I imagine he will arrange for some people to stay on
watch, here at Swallow Mountain. This is my apprentice’s homeland,
after all; they will definitely keep an eye on it. Now that your Ji
clan has so many monstrous Dao-soldiers present…there’s no reason
for me to stay here. I won’t tarry any longer, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
Immortal,” Truekeep and the others said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt tremendous
gratitude for this Immortal of the Black-White College, who had
hurried here at such a critical time. Although he was Ning’s
master, when trouble came, some masters would flee even faster than
their disciples would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai didn’t
say anything else. He soared straight into the skies. The City of Ten
Thousand Swords had already set down a grand spacelock formation,
preventing teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After flying
high into the sky, Immortal Diancai immediately disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Immortal
Diancai truly is a loyal man,” the monstrous Immortal Duohe said
with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admirable,
admirable,” Immortal Witchsui said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true. For
Ning to have such a master is his good fortune,” Ninefire sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. The
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed,
black-haired Immortal Diancai was seated face to face with a short
old man. Before the two of them, there was only a flagon of Immortal
wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Fivecraze,” Immortal Diancai said softly, “The
arrival of Patriarch Arcanum caused me to feel powerless. Ning is my
apprentice, my one and only disciple…but I’m not able to do
anything in the face of the Youngflame clan’s attempt to kill him!
I’m completely unable to save him!” As he spoke, Diancai’s body
was visibly trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai,” the short elder said hurriedly, “Don’t
be so stubborn. He’s a Celestial Immortal, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he is? In
the past, wasn’t senior Northwalker, a Loose Immortal, comparable
to a Celestial Immortal in might?” Immortal Diancai growled, “I’ve
made up my mind. Today, I am going to leave. Leave this major world
of ours, and temper myself through adventuring. Although I reached
the peak of the Void stage long ago and although I can attempt my
tribulation, I’ve been suppressing myself, precisely because I
don’t feel confident in succeeding. My talent is a bit weaker than
this disciple of mine’s. If I don’t frantically temper myself,
most likely, in the end, I won’t be able to avoid being overcome by
the Celestial Tribulation and becoming a Loose Immortal. After
becoming a Loose Immortal…even if I stay alive countless eons and
reach senior Northwalker’s level of power, what’s the point? In
the end, I still won’t be able to overcome the Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations, resulting in death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder was
silent for a moment, then said slowly, “It seems your apprentice’s
matter has affected you tremendously.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, his master, have
failed him. I am of no use!” Immortal Diancai rose to his feet.
“I’ll leave now, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful!” The
short elder said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To temper one’s self
naturally required one to experience deadly situations, to walk on
the border between life and death, which would allow one’s insights
and comprehension to rapidly increase. However, this sort of
tempering was extremely dangerous. When walking on a line between
life and death, one might truly fall into death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
laughed, then charged into the skies, quickly disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five figures appeared
in succession by the short elder’s side. These were the other
Immortals of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly is
decisive,” a youthful-looking ‘child’ sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to him…”
The tall, muscular, chain-shrouded man said in a low voice, “Although
I am a reincarnated Immortal, my Dao-heart isn’t as firm as his. It
seems the common saying is true; if you fail in one life to become a
Celestial Immortal, even if you reincarnated ten times or a hundred
times, you still won’t be able to become a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are still some
reincarnated Immortals who do become Celestial Immortals,” the
short elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But how few and rare
are they?” The youthful-looking child sighed. “With the great
determination that junior apprentice-brother Diancai has…as I see
it, he might have just increased his chances of becoming a Celestial
Immortal by a bit. He may very well truly have a shot at becoming
only the second Celestial Immortal the Black-White College has seen
in our ancient history.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He does indeed have
a shot,” the tall, blood-robed, skinny youth said with a nod.
“However…the Celestial Tribulation is difficult to overcome!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them fell
silent. The Celestial Tribulation? This was a nightmare for all Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals. The worst part of it was, every single
Celestial Tribulation was different in power; just because one was
strong, didn’t mean they would necessarily succeed in overcoming
it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, junior
apprentice-brother Diancai needs to return safely. Otherwise, there’s
no point in discussing the Celestial Tribulation.” The short
elder’s eyes were filled with anticipation. “I wonder if I, a
crazy old madman, will be able to see him again before I die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within another world.
The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no idea as to
what had happened in the outside world. His attention was completely
focused on the Primaltwin secret art; this was a soul-splitting
technique, and he had to be incredibly cautious in using it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position on a prayer mat. Not too far away, the giant yellow
bear and the old black bull were staring at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t fail,
will he?” The old black bull said worriedly They had already set up
a barrier around them, preventing their voices from reaching out and
disturbing Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s
visualization technique is an extremely impressive one. Even if he
fails, he would at most lose control over half of his soul; he
wouldn’t die,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lose control over
half his soul…” The old black bull murmured to himself. That was
still quite severe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Primaltwin art
was a success, the soul would be split in two, but both parts would
still remain in existence. Although Ning would temporarily be
weakened, that would be a minor matter, and he would soon recover.
If, however, one of the two parts of his soul was to be completely
extinguished, Ning’s personality might change drastically. He might
even develop mental issues such as depression or madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To lose control over
half of one’s soul…this could indeed cause a drastic personality
change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huff. Puff. Ning took
several long breaths, completely calm. He had already memorized and
mentally repeated the Primaltwin art several times now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his sea of
consciousness. The spirit-Ning stood there, entire body emanating
with sword-ki. This was an evolved sword-soul! Sword-souls were
almost utterly indestructible, making a split even more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. The
forehead of the spirit-Ning began to glow with light, a
vertical-shaped light. Ning used all of his energy in executing the
secret art, causing his own divine will to form into a knife that
began to cut both upwards and downwards from his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That vertical light
slowly began to elongate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arggggggh!” Agony.
The soul-ripping agony caused even Ning, despite his incredible
endurance and Dao-heart, to tremble. However, generally speaking,
those who dared to execute the Primaltwin technique were all
extraordinary figures who would be able to endure this level of pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vertical light
continued to elongate. It reached his neck…his chest…his abdomen…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vertical light
splitting the ‘body’ of the spirit-Ning had completely cut him in
half. It was as though a ray of light had just cleanly bisected him.
However, this wasn’t the dangerous part; what was going to happen
next was the dangerous part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SPLIT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul began to
split apart. That vertical light splitting his spirit in half
separated, causing his spirit to split into two parts. One half,
moving as fast as lightning, flew back into Ning’s physical body.
In the instant his soul split apart, Ning felt a wave of dizziness
overcome him, and while flying over his soul trembled as well. Ning’s
Dao-heart, however, was resilient, and so although the dizziness
caused him to feel incredibly tired, he was still able to withstand
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a step that
had to be fast and had to be endured. Otherwise, if the other half of
the soul wasn’t able to enter the Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater, it
would die on the way. After splitting the soul, there was no way to
merge it again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other half of the
soul flew out like a streak of light, entering the Sole-Ki Pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant it did,
the soul felt as though it was a son entering the embrace of the
other, a wandering, adrift boat that had finally returned to harbor.
There was a feeling of peace, of warmth, of calm which completely
filled the soul. The soul had its vessel…naturally, it felt nice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“visualization
technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the moment, Ning
had no time to waste on training his Primaltwin. His very first
response was to immediately have both of his souls immediately
execute the visualization technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his sea of
consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The now-shrunken
spirit-Ning sat down in the lotus position. Ahead of him, within the
vast void of his sea of consciousness, appeared an enormous image of
Maiden Nuwa. The image of Maiden Nuwa, in the void, seemed to press
down upon both the past and the future. It was eternal and
unchanging, and it caused Ning’s soul to become incomparably stable
as well. The aura of divine light emanating from her, filled with
boundless warmth, illuminated Ning’s soul, causing the badly
damaged soul to begin to heal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Sole-Ki
Pearl of Primalwater, there was the second, also-shrunken
spirit-Ning, who was also visualizing an image of Maiden Nuwa. When
her image appeared, her light seemed to stretch off into infinity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both souls were in a
wounded state right now, but they rapidly began to heal. This healing
process took nearly three full days, during the course of which both
souls grew considerably stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning opened
his eyes. The Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater in front of him flew up as
well, landing within his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
The giant yellow bear asked hurriedly, “How is your soul?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve healed to
roughly seventy percent of normal,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy percent?!”
The giant yellow bear was stunned. “It seems you truly do have a
formidable visualization technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the soul split
into two, both souls would have roughly half of the strength of the
former soul. For an ordinary visualization technique, the user would
be lucky to see each half-soul stabilize at fifty percent power. You
could forget about having the soul quickly grow back! But Ning had
not only stabilized his souls, he had already reached seventy percent
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, this is a
one-time thing. After all, the damage caused by the soul-splitting
was fresh, which was why I was able to heal so much of it at one go.
In the future, it will be slower. To return to a divine sense of a
thousand kilometers…I’m afraid it will take a long time,” Ning
sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be too
greedy. You’ve already produced a Primaltwin, after all; this
represents a second life for you,” the giant yellow bear sighed.
“Your Primaltwin can also become an Earth Immortal or Celestial
Immortal; in fact, if your true body dies, your Primaltwin will still
survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing, Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true body and the
Primaltwin had linked memories; in all other ways, however, they were
completely independent. Indeed, a Primaltwin could be described as a
second life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and begin
your training. Completely refine all of the essence within the
Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater,” the giant yellow bear laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, then had his Primaltwin within the Sole-Ki Pearl begin to
train.

Chapter 6 - Primal Breakthrough
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sole-Ki Pearl of
Primalwater was a naturally occurring spirit-treasure that was one of
the most superb resources for nourishing the soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
Immortal cultivators who, believing their Zifu’s to be damaged,
would steal the bodies of others. This sort of possession,
however…had a major problem. It was that the affinity between the
body and the soul would be very weak. Generally speaking, most bodies
were not of very high quality. Some Immortal cultivators, upon
finding a good body, would seize it. Once their affinity with it
reached a certain level, they would be extremely satisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the likes of
the Darkvalley Pearl, the Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater, and other
such naturally occurring spirit-treasures were truly perfect vessels.
Because they had never been inhabited by a soul, once a soul did
enter them, they would merge together perfectly. In terms of quality,
as naturally occurring spirit-treasures, they were of course of
superb quality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was lucky for me
that Youngflame Nong had procured this. If I were to search for it on
my own, where the hell would I even start?” Ji Ning had begun his
refining process, and as he did, he instantly realized how wonderful
this pearl was. He couldn’t help but sigh to himself, “Youngflame
Nong must have prepared this for himself. However, in the end, his
efforts ended up being for my sake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sole-Ki Pearls of
Primalwater were filled with elemental essence to begin with; there
was thus no need to absorb elemental ki from the surrounding world.
One only needed to refine the ki within it. Ning was currently rising
in power at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A world suddenly came
into being within the pearl. A Zifu region was born, and large
amounts of elemental water essence began to transform, causing the
Zifu region to expand in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stars. The Moon. The
Golden Crown. Three major Manifestations appeared…and the body
immediately broke through to the Wanxiang level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sort of
‘training’ truly is wonderful.” The old black bull, watching,
couldn’t help but sigh in amazement, “What tremendous speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just like
when a reincarnated Immortal regains his memories. He already had the
sufficient insights and a strong enough Dao-heart. Given that the
Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater has condensed water elemental essence
within it to begin with, it wouldn’t even surprise me if he trained
all the way to the Primal stage,” the giant yellow bear said. These
sorts of treasures, which contained elemental essence within them,
would generally allow those who used them to reach the Primal stage.
One couldn’t help but sigh at how marvelous the treasures of the
natural world could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s about to make
a breakthrough,” the old black bull suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After just an hour, the
Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater had risen in power from the Xiantian
level to the peak of the Wanxiang level. It was currently moving
towards the Primal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the pearl. There
was a vast, empty void here. The Zifu Lake was almost infinitely
vast, and within the sky of this world, thousands of stars, a Jade
Rabbit, and a Golden Crow hung in the sky. The aura of this place was
even more powerful than the aura of Ning’s true body. This was
because this body had truly reached the absolute peak of the peak
Wanxiang stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was above
the thousands of stars, at the very heart of the void in his Zifu
region. He willed it…and instantly, the sea of elemental energy in
his Zifu began to frantically condense into trillions of specks of
purified light that wildly soared into the skies, towards those
stars, the moon, and the sun, all of which were beginning to move in
accordance with a secret rhythm. In the instant in which they all
merged into the heavenly bodies, the stars, the Jade Rabbit, and the
Golden Crow, all of which had already reached their limit long ago,
suddenly transformed into pillars of light that shot downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands of
pillars of light, some thin, some thick. The pillars of light created
from the countless stars appeared very thin, while the pillars of
light from the Golden Crow and the Moon Rabbit were clearly far
thicker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless pillars
of light all focused on the central part of the Zifu, beginning to
slowly form into an enormous creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous creature
was beginning to take shape. The light from the Golden Crow was
focusing on its head, forming a tortoise-like beast. The light from
the Jade Rabbit was beginning to focus on the other side, forming a
serpent’s head. The countless beams of light from the stars were
beginning to form the body of the creature. The massive thing began
to take clearer and clearer form; it was a mutant beast that looked
like a turtle with a snake intertwined within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a legendary
creature; the Turtle-Snake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any living creature,
upon breaking through to the Primal level, would form a Primal
Turtle-Snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant, the
enormous Turtle-Snake suddenly seemed to move. It actually began to
crawl downwards, through the void, until it reached the elemental
sea. Within that vast elemental sea of energy, the enormous,
island-like Turtle-Snake began to slowly swim about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Turtle-Snake has
been formed. Let the Primal soul descend!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Ning’s
soul, which had remained hovering in the sky this entire time,
descended directly into the enormous Turtle-Snake. As it entered the
creature’s body, it felt an incomparably comfortable sensation. It
was as though the body of the Turtle-Snake was innately nurturing to
souls; Ning could even feel his own soul begin to strengthen at an
alarming speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a shocking
speed of advancement. The rate at which my soul is strengthening is
even faster than the rate at which it was healing when I visualized
the image of Maiden Nuwa.” Ning sighed in absolute amazement. He
finally understood why it was that although many Immortal cultivators
had fairly weak souls at the Wanxiang stage, upon reaching the Primal
stage, they would all quickly come to possess divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because, within the Primal Turtle-Snake, the soul would strengthen at
an astonishing rate! It was like grass being sown into mud, then
quickly growing out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Turtle-Snake
swiveled there. Yin and Yang intersected on the back of the
Turtle-Snake, which is to say, it’s shell. Suddenly, a golden flame
emerged, blazing with incomparable heat and yet not harming the
Primal Turtle-Snake in the slightest. This was the ‘Primal Fire’
which every single Primal Daoist was capable of using.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. The
enormous Turtle-Snake swam about happily in the vast sea of elemental
ki. The eyes of both the turtle-head and the snake-head both seemed
extremely lively and clever, as though they were true living
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the thousands of
stars, the Golden Crow, and the Jade Rabbit, they continued to send
down their condensed elemental essence. Bathed by it, the
Turtle-Snake was still continuing to slowly grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another long
period of time, the stars, the Golden Crow, and the Jade Rabbit
finally stopped sending down essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The early Primal
stage!” The giant Primal Turtle-Snake spoke out in the human
tongue. “The energy within the Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater truly
is remarkable. It was only used up after I trained all the way to the
early Primal stage, then solidified my base.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant he had
become a Primal Daoist, there had actually also been a sudden change
in the surrounding elemental ki aura of the underwater estate. In
addition, the ancient, eternal aura of the Dao itself had also
descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He made the
breakthrough.” The giant yellow bear and the old black bull both
laughed. Very soon, mist suddenly began to emerge from the pearl,
which had been hovering in midair…and then the mist solidified into
a black-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, seniors,”
the black-robed Ji Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look at your
original body,” the giant yellow bear said with a smirk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
turned his head. The original Ning turned his head as well. Their
gazes intersected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The two
both laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, their
memories were linked; it was as though one was the left hand, while
the other was the right hand. As they exchanged glances, their
thoughts were identical; this was, indeed, an extremely marvelous
feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, fellow
Daoist,” the black-robed Ning said..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, fellow
Daoist,” the other Ning also said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, both laughed.
With identical memories and thoughts, saying ‘greetings, fellow
Daoist’ to each other was like mumbling to himself. It was nothing
more than a joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How does it feel?”
The giant yellow bear asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very good,” the
black-robed Ning nodded. “Breaking through to the Primal level
feels very different. The soul fused with the Primal Turtle-Dragon,
which felt incomparably comfortable. It is also advancing very
rapidly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Generally
speaking, upon breaking through to the Primal level, the rate of
advancement for the soul will be very fast for a period of time.
Afterwards, it will slow down, and in fact the soul might advance
very little even after a century passes,” the giant yellow bear
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
nodded. “Although the Primal Turtle-Snake is of tremendous help to
the soul, everything has a limit. If the soul were to continue to
rise at this rate perpetually, that would be ridiculous!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me first try the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] with this Primaltwin and see how
it is.” The black-robed Ning willed it, and suddenly, a dense
cluster of more than seven hundred flying swords appeared. Nine were
the Nethercold swords, while 360 were high-grade fire-attribute
Earth-ranked flying swords, and another 360 were high-grade
water-attribute Earth-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had picked these
flying swords out from the vast ocean of magic treasures left behind
by Immortal Witchriver in the estate. Ning had procured more than
sixteen thousand magic treasures. With flying swords being one of the
most common types of magic treasures, it hadn’t been too hard for
him to find some that were suited to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
willed the formation to immediately activated. Previously, when
activing the formation, Ning had always used the Nethercold swords
first, then led the other 720 Mortal-ranked flying swords with them!
Now, however, with all 720 Mortal-ranked flying swords having been
changed into Earth-ranked flying swords, the difficulty of
controlling the swords instantly increased more than a hundredfold.
After all, he had upgraded far too many swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” The
black-robed Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it?” The
old black bull laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to activate
the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], but I’m
unable to.” The black-robed Ning shook his head, then began to
lower the level. The eighth level? The seventh level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, he
successfully activated the technique. More than five hundred flying
swords swiveled about Ning, beginning to levitate up and down. Ning’s
Primal-level elemental ki filled them, and his soul commanded them.
Before his chest solidified an incomparably brilliant flying sword,
which was even covered with a layer of prismatic white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seventh level
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].” The black-robed Ning shook his
head. “I broke through to the Primal level, and my elemental ki has
increased in power dramatically. However, my soul is still somewhat
weaker than it was, before it split in two. Even though I’ve gained
much enlightenment regarding the Dao…I’m still unable to go past
the seventh level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are, after
all, all Earth-ranked magic treasures, and most are high-grade. Even
the seventh level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is still
more powerful than the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] with those Mortal-ranked flying sword,” the giant yellow
bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Just now, I
took a look at your other treasures,” the giant yellow bear said,
pointing towards the other magic treasures, all separated by type.
“Some of the sacks have quite a few golems in them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
nodded. “These are the golems that we discovered in the Witchriver
Immortal Estate. That Fiendgod collected them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me help you
retrofit these golems. Otherwise, they won’t listen to your
commands,” the giant yellow bear said. “Right; don’t you have
fifty thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence? Hurry up and
refine it all. You are only at the early Primal level, right? Raise
your power a bit more. That way, your elemental ki will grow more
pure, and it will be easier for you to control your magic treasures.
By then, I imagine you’ll be able to control the eighth, or even
the ninth, level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
nodded. “Right.” There was no reason not to use them up; it was
best to use the liquid to improve his own power. Fifty thousand
kilograms? This was more than enough to allow his Primaltwin to once
more improve its power dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I
need to focus on the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation],” the
black-robed Ning mused to himself. Although he had read many secret
manuals, amongst those that were meant for Ki Refiners, the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] remained the best suited for him, and the
most powerful one as well. His Primaltwin was a Ki Refiner; there was
no way it could train in divine abilities, and so it naturally would
have to focus on the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was destined that
his Primaltwin would become an extremely powerful ki-refining Sword
Immortal!

Chapter 7 - Binding the Underwater Estate
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the quiet hall.
The black-robed Ning sat in the lotus position, a jade bottle in
front of him. The liquefied elemental essence within it was
continuously flowing into Ning’s mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh.” The
old black bull watched, quite excited. He had been alone for far, far
too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the giant yellow
bear, he waved a paw and two giant sacks opened up. The golems within
all flew out, howling through the air. A total of thirty-six Qiongqi
Manticore Golems, along with a black-armored male golem, emerged. As
they flew out, they began to frantically struggle, trying to fight
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be good and be
obedient,” the giant yellow bear chuckled merrily. The thirty-six
Qiongqi golems and the black-armored man all hung there in midair.
Although they were struggling, there were unable to move at all,
causing them to all reveal looks of amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
black-armored man stared at the giant yellow bear, then shouted, “Why
are you confining us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, you actually
have a soul planted inside you?” The giant yellow bear then shook
his head. “Who made these golems? He was so rough and clumsy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clatter clatter
clatter…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six Qiongqi
golems and the black-armored man all suddenly separated into tens of
thousands of component parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me first collect
the parts. I’ll slowly reconfigure them.” The giant yellow bear
had a look of anticipation in his eyes. He waved a paw, and whoosh,
all of the tens of thousands of parts disappeared, having been
teleported away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, kid,” the
giant yellow bear said. “I’m going to go analyze these golems and
wipe out some of the seals the former controller placed on them.
After fixing them up, I’ll return them to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush,” Ning
laughed. Ning himself wasn’t training; it was currently the
Primaltwin, the ‘black-robed Ji Ning’, who was training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed on.
Finally, all of the fifty thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence in the jade bottle had been used up. The black-robed Ning
opened his eyes, revealing a look of joy in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, how is it?”
The old black bull asked eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just as I used up
the liquefied elemental essence, I finally reached the late Primal
stage,” the black-robed Ning said. “Let me test the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Once again, more
than seven hundred flying swords appeared. The Earth-ranked flyinig
swords, led by the Nethercold Sword Formation, all flew into the air.
However, even after trying his hardest for a long period of time,
Ning was still unable to control them well, and was only able to
execute the eighth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
“My elemental ki is far more pure than it was before, but I’m
still only able to use the eighth level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you’ve
already reached the Primal level with your Primaltwin. By using it,
you can go and bind this underwater estate now,” the giant yellow
bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind the estate?”
Ning willed it, and suddenly, the Primaltwin transformed into a pearl
that flew into Ning’s clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me.” The
giant yellow bear walked forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt tremendous
anticipation. He had waited for this day for a very, very long time.
When he had become a Zifu Disciple, he had only been able to bind a
talisman; now, after having created his Primaltwin, he was finally
going to be able to bind the underwater estate. Afterwards, he would
be able to carry it around with him, just like Immortal Juhua had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He followed the giant
yellow bear through a wide, spacious corridor that he previously
hadn’t been given access to at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From now on, you
will be granted access into 90% of the areas of the underwater
estate,” the giant yellow bear said. “After binding the
underwater estate, you’ll be able to carry it with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“90%? Senior, are you
saying that there are still areas which I cannot enter?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. For example,
the Divine Abilities Hall; you cannot enter it. There are some other
regions as well.” The giant yellow bear gave Ning a glance. “I
imagine that you have already guessed…that at the Primal stage, you
are only able to do a very basic binding of the estate, allowing you
to carry it with you. To truly master all of its mysteries, you will
need to wait until the day you become an Empyrean God and truly
become Master’s disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
expected this all along. Earlier, he had watched as the giant yellow
bear had effortlessly paralyzed in midair and rendered immobile the
black-armored male golem, which was comparable to a peak Loose
Immortal. In addition, Ning could sense the ancient aura of eternity
emanating from the giant yellow bear, an aura that was even more
heart-shaking than the aura which emanated from the Fiendgod he had
encountered in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. To completely
master the underwater estate as a Primal Daoist? Even Ning himself
felt that he was far from being able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God?”
Ning murmured to himself, “Daoist Threelives, what in the world did
you leave behind, that I have to become an Empyrean God before
receiving it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They walked through the
corridor and thorugh various passages. Soon, they arrived at an
ancient, simple room. Ning walked in, immediately feeling as though
his heart was more peaceful than it ever had been before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Still
Room. In the past, Master personally set down a Buddhist formation,
the ‘Grand Bodhi Stillheart Formation’, in this place. Amongst
all the mind-calming formations known throughout the Three Realms,
this formation ranks close to the top. Its name is ordinary, but its
power is extraordinary.” The giant yellow bear pointed at the
giant, vast room with a claw. Instantly, an incomparably complicated
golden formation appeared on the walls. Ning felt dizzy just looking
at it. “This formation isn’t something you can try to comprehend
yet. One glance is enough; don’t stare at it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The complicated golden
formation covering the four walls of the place once more dimmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” The giant
yellow bear pointed at the center of the Still Room. There was a
platform there, atop which was an ordinary-looking, inky jade bed
which emanated a frigid aura. “This is made from netherwater jade,
retrieved from the deepest depths of the Nine Hells. It is extremely
cold. When you first sit atop it, you feel feel extremely cold, but
soon afterwards, you will feel very comfortable, and also feel it
help to calm your heart. This jade bed alone is comparable in value
to a Pure Yang magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
clenched, hard. A Pure Yang magic treasure? Daoist Threelives truly
was wealthy and generous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, don’t
even think about selling it. This is already part of the underwater
estate; there’s no way for you to pull it off.” The corners of
the giant yellow bear’s mouth twitched upwards, a hint of smug
amusement visible. “Haha, enough joking. The Still Room is the
center of the entire underwater estate. All you need to do is bind
it, and you’ll have a basic control over the underwater estate. Go
ahead and start the binding process.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, walking
straight towards the inky jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon sitting atop it,
he did indeed feel a heart-penetrating chill instantly fill his
entire body. Even his soul seemed to have been frozen solid, but
immediately afterwards, he felt calmer than he ever had before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A void-soul! His soul
was in a state of complete transcendence. Ning began to carefully go
through and dissect every single thing which had happened to him
recently. This sort of reflection and contemplation of one’s
memories caused Ning’s Dao-heart to slowly strengthen even further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is incredible.
The Buddhist formation, ‘Bodhi Stillheart Formation’, and the
netherwater jade truly are extraordinary.” Ning hesitated no
longer. With but a thought, he unleashed the black-robed Ning, who
also sat down atop the netherwater jade, then began to use his
powerful elemental ki to fill the Still Room and bind it to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Still Room was
slowly becoming bound. Time flowed on…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This binding process
took six full days! And this was only the first, most elementary
binding possible for the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a truly
marvelous feeling.” It felt as though every part of the entire
underwater estate was under his control, but the strange thing was,
although he felt as though he was in complete control, the Divine
Abilities Hall seemed to have vanished, as though it didn’t exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weird.” Ning
returned to the main hall. Within the main hall, the giant yellow
bear and the old black bull were both present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, did you
forget about something?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
giant yellow bear looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures which
Immortal Juhua left behind.” Ning couldn’t help but say, “I’ve
already bound the underwater estate…where are his treasures?” The
treasures of Immortal Juhua, the disassembled golems…although Ning
could sense the entire estate, he couldn’t find any trace of those
things. And, right now, Ning didn’t feel any sense of control over
the giant yellow bear either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, I almost
forgot.” The giant yellow bear waved a hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly, a
mountain of magic treasures appeared within the hall. It truly was a
mountain! A treasure mountain that was hundreds on hundreds of meters
in height. Ning’s eyes instantly lit up upon seeing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After living for a
few million years, he really did accumulate quite a bit of treasure.”
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “Immortal Juhua left behind a
total of three Immortal-ranked magic treasures, and each one of them
could be considered high-grade for Immortal-ranked treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
began to shine. Three? And all high-grade?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua really
lived up to his reputation as a Loose Immortal who had lived for
millions of years, a figure even more powerful than Immortal
Northwalker. Most likely, even the Immortal artifacts owned by actual
Celestial Immortals were only on par with his at best.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, only one is
left,” the giant yellow bear continued, pointing towards the old
black bull. “Him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one?!” Ning
was flabbergasted. “Didn’t you say there were three? Immortal
Juhua left three behind, right? The fourth master of the estate died
at the Wanxiang level; there’s no way he could’ve taken away the
Immortal-ranked magic treasures. Where’d the other two go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke? Two
high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures had just ‘gone
missing’?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be in such a
rush. It’s a good thing for you that two of them are gone now,”
the old black bull said smugly. “You still have me, right? Ji Ning,
kiddo, in the future, this old bull is going to follow you, and you
are enormously lucky to have me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still filled
with puzzlement. What about the other two Immortal-ranked magic
treasures? The spirit of the estate wouldn’t have embezzled them,
would he?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said, “The three Immortal-ranked magic treasures left behind by
Immortal Juhua were the ‘Thousandbull Sword’, the ‘Nightriver
Painting’, and the ‘Nine Realms Seal’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nightriver
Painting was chosen by Immortal Juhua as his reward after he overcame
the seventh level of the Wargod Hall, a high-grade Immortal-ranked
magic treasure. Within it, it held an ancient river from the
primordial era that came before the three thousand major worlds were
born; the Nightriver. By drawing the enemy into the painting, the
enemy would be within your domain and dramatically weakened, while
you would be able to borrow from the power of the Nightriver to
increase your own might. One of the reasons why Immortal Juhua was so
famous was because of this magic treasure,” the giant yellow bear
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened,
speechless. What fine treasures! Compared to the Nightriver Painting,
the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp was far too inferior. That was a
primordial river, the Nightriver, which existed before the three
thousand major worlds had been born!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nine Realms Seal
was fashioned by Immortal Juhua from the extract of materials
collected by Immortal Juhua after wandering nine different major
worlds. This seal…naturally, it’s used to smash and crush. He
used up an astonishing amount of precious materials in fashioning it,
managing to brute-force it up to be a high-grade Immortal-ranked
seal. In his old age, Immortal Juhua loved to smash people with the
seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousandbull
Sword…when Immortal Juhua met the Thousand Swords Immortal, the two
exchanged blows. After killing the Thousand Swords Immortal and
acquiring hundreds of valuable flying swords, he traded them for
precious materials, using them and other treasures he had accumulated
in forging a flying sword. Immortal Juhua was also a Sword Immortal;
the most important thing for a Sword Immortal is their flying swords.
The Thousandbull Sword was thus the weapon he used in order to
dominate the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened,
spellbound and rapt. He couldn’t help but ask, “Then what
happened to the Nightriver Painting and the Nine Realms Seal?”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me finish,”
the giant yellow bear continued. “Did you think that I just
absconded with those two Immortal-ranked magic treasures? When I
followed Master, I saw more treasures than you’ve even heard of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Immortal Juhua
died, he left behind these three Immortal-ranked magic treasures. He
died just as the Fiendgod Era had come to an end. Over the countless
years that passed since then, I was completely bored out of my mind.
It wasn’t convenient for me to mess around with the magic treasures
which Master left behind, and so I took some of the treasures which
Immortal Juhua left behind and began to retrofit them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retrofit them?!”
Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousandbull
Sword, the Nightriver Painting, the Nine Realms Seal; all of them
were pretty good, but they couldn’t be considered top-grade; they
weren’t truly mighty,” the giant yellow bear said “That Nine
Realms Seal in particular; it was forged in a slipshod way,
completely wasting the massive amount of precious materials which
were piled together to create that seal. So…I completely destroyed
it, pulled out the extracted essence of it, then slowly spend the
next 360 million years to completely fuse the essence into the
Thousandbull Sword. This slow fusing process caused the Thousandbull
Slow to evolve to a new level of power, but it didn’t disrupt any
of its inherent might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">360 million years? Not
even a Celestial Immortal would dare to waste time like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, you know, I
realized the Nightriver Painting was also pretty terrible as well.”
The giant yellow bear shook his large head. “A perfectly fine
primordial Nightriver was being wasted, having merely been forged
into a separate world. To pull the enemy into the world and fight
inside it? What sort of a terrible idea is that? So…I just
completely destroyed it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I pulled out the
flows of the Nightriver from within the painting, then reforged it
into a sword-diagram which I also fused into the Thousandbull Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
seemed extremely smug. “Now, this is what you call a real treasure!
The Thousandbull Sword, as a short, is unblockably sharp; with the
extracted essence of the Nine Realms Seal, the Thousandbull Sword’s
power rose dramatically. It absolutely became a top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But after mixing in
the Nightriver Painting as well…whenever the Thousandbull Sword is
use, the ancient, primordial Nightriver will suddenly appear within a
region of ten thousand kilometers. With the assistance of the
Nightriver, one’s power will explode dramatically! The stand-alone
Nightriver Painting required one to pull the enemy into it, but the
upgraded Thousandbull Sword has no need to do so at all. As long as
the sword is drawn, the ten-thousand kilometer Nightriver will
immediately appear.” The giant yellow bear was absolutely delighted
with himself. “Heh heh heh. The Pure Yang swords used by the major
powers of the Three Realms…which one of them doesn’t have a
sword-diagram within? How can a Sword Immortal without a
sword-diagram even be considered a Sword Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three mighty
Immortal-ranked magic treasures were combined into one. When the
upgraded Thousandbull Sword leaves the sheath, the Nightriver
Sword-Diagram shall appear…sword-ki shall emerge and roam about for
ten thousand kilometers, completely unstoppable.” The giant yellow
bear was extremely smug. “This truly is a top-grade amongst
top-grade Immortal-ranked treasures. Those three original magic
treasures combined aren’t even half as good as it is. As for the
hundreds of millions of years I spent in total on this project, I’m
not going to go into detail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousandbull Sword!”
The giant yellow bear called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming!” The old
black bull called out. Instantly, from within the mountain of
treasures that was many hundreds of meters high, a black sword flew
out. When this flying sword emerged, a whooshing sound of flowing
water could be heard as well, as though an ancient, primordial river
had begun to flow. And then…the hazy outlines of a river appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the illusion of
the river appeared, space itself seemed to freeze. Ning could feel a
sudden pressure envelope him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ordinary looking
black flying sword had caused the entire mountain of treasures next
to it to fade by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The old black
bull immediately transformed into a streak of light, burrowing into
the black flying sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, take a look at
me; what do you think? Aren’t I awesome?” The black flying sword
hovered there in midair as the old bull’s voice echoed in the
halls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly called
out in surprise, “You, how can you move around? How can magic
treasures move around on their own?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures were
lifeless things; without a master controlling them, how could they
move around? Even if an Immortal-ranked magic treasure had given
birth to a treasure-spirit, logically speaking, they shouldn’t be
able to move around. For example, the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp was
completely incapable of movement; it could only summon flames to
block Xue Hongyi, but in the end, it was still forcibly taken away by
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who told you that
magic treasures can’t move around?” The giant yellow bear said.
“Pure Yang treasures, for example, can soar into the heavens or
delve deep into the earth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang magic
treasures? Those were on a higher level than even Immortal-ranked
magic treasures. They were simply on a realm too far from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what I
know, Immortal-ranked magic treasures aren’t capable of movement,”
Ning said. “I read it in the books, and earlier, I also talked
about how I acquired an Immortal-ranked magic treasure after killing
Xue Hongyi in the Witchriver Immortal Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you talking
about that Azuresilk Godfire Lamp?” The giant yellow bear shook his
head disdainfully. “That’s just a low-grade Immortal-ranked item!
It’s true that the vast majority of Immortal-ranked magic treasures
are incapable of movement, and in fact, there’s extremely few
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures capable of movement as
well. The Thousandbull Sword, however, is a top-grade amongst
top-grades; his sentience and his power is comparable to some weak
Pure Yang magic treasures. Given how sentient he is and how pure and
valuable his components are, he’s naturally able to move about on
his own. Still, without a master controlling him, he’s only able to
release a tiny amount of his power. If your Primaltwin was to unleash
its full power, you’d be able to suppress him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. His Primaltwin was at the late Primal level; when using
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] with the Grand Dao Domain and
the Dao-Path of Water, he was absolutely comparable to a Loose
Immortal! Only a Loose Immortal’s full power could suppress this
ownerless Immortal-ranked magic treasure? The Azuresilk Godfire Lamp
had been suppressed by someone like Xue Hongyi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, train hard.
After you become an Earth Immortal, I can come out and fight again,
hahaha…I, Thousandbull, will once be able to roam and dominate the
world!” The black flying sword landed. The old black bull walked
out of the blade, speaking with incomparable excitement. But then, he
grew forlorn once more. “Unfortunately, Juhua has already passed
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures all
felt a very unique attachment to their first master; their first
master was like their parents or elders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps he might
have reincarnated.” Ning could sense the old black bull’s
sadness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop trying to
console me. Juhua died countless years ago. Even if he reincarnated…I
can’t even imagine how many times he would’ve reincarnated by
now,” the old black bull sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t in a
hurry to depart from Stillwater Commandery.. After all, there were
three years left before the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Instead, he
began to calmly train in seclusion within the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, he had
reached the Grand Dao Domain level, then mastered the complete Dao of
Rainwater. Ning needed to quickly and completely master a way of
using them to increase his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, more than a year had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Stellar Hall
of the underwater estate. The space within this separate world, the
Stellar Hall, was quite vast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was walking
through the skies. Suddenly, he disappeared before reappearing more
than ten kilometers away, where a spatial ripple had just appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish, swish, swish.
Ning blinked forward repeatedly, disappearing and reappearing as he
teleported again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success, success.”
The old black bull, lying on the grassy ground next to the thatched
hut, stood up and called out in delight, “Ji Ning, you’ve finally
mastered the technique of teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It took me over a
year.” The distant Ning, with a blink, reappeared in front of the
thatched hut, then said, “I feel so ashamed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Teleporting through the
void was one of the most basic, most fundamental underpinnings to the
Grand Dao of the Qiankun 1.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another name for the
Grand Dao of the Qiankun was the Grand Dao of Space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake,
because of her innate abilities, was able to utilize the ‘Void
Blink’ technique was a Xiantian lifeform. In truth, the Void Blink
was a form of teleportation through the void! However, for an
ordinary Immortal cultivator to try and develop a void teleport
technique was extremely difficult; after all, this was akin to
gaining a basic understanding of a Grand Dao. The vast majority of
Wanxiang Adepts would therefore purchase and keep a Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seal with them at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, virtually all
Earth Immortals or Loose Immortals were capable of void
teleportation. This was because, generally speaking, Earth Immmortals
and Loose Immortals were in control of at least one complete
Dao-Path. If one mastered a complete Dao-Path, one would be able to
take control of the world around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
they could cause the power of the Dao to descend, placing the world
around them under their control. When controlling the world around
them, they would be able to clearly sense the Grand Dao of Qiankun
around them. As time passed and as they did this often, they would
naturally be able to comprehend the principles of teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals, regardless of which Dao-Path they had
mastered, were almost all capable of void teleportation; the only
difference was in how much time they spent before achieving it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The giant
yellow bear suddenly appeared. “Ji Ning,” the giant yellow bear
called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded in satisfaction. This year of pain-staking, solitary training,
combined with the invisible pressure from the Youngflame clan, had
indeed caused Ning to improve rapidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have already
completely fused your Dao of Rainwater into your Grand Dao of the
Sword; your sword arts can be considered nearly perfect for your
current level,” the giant yellow bear said. “However, Immortal
cultivators who spend all their time in private training will never
be able to become Celestial Immortals. You remain unable to break
through in the Dao of the Inferno and the Dao of the Gale, unable to
completely master them. This is because you’ve spent all your time
here in study, instead of going out and tempering yourself. It is now
time for you to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently. He,
too, recently felt a desire in his heart to see the outside world; a
desire to fight, to test himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a cold winter.
It was noon, but the skies were dark. Giant plumes of snow were
drifting about in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fur-clad youth
suddenly appeared on Brightheart Island. Turning his head, he glanced
at his surroundings. The area around him had been reduced to rubble.
This was, after all, a place under the surveillance of the minions of
the Youngflame clan, and in fact, Youngflame Nong’s biological
father had come here as well. Because he was unable to attack the
City of Ten Thousand Swords, in his rage, he had destroyed all of the
buildings on Brightheart Island here in Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I
will definitely rebuild Brightheart Island,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, it is time
to go. Soon, the patrols from the Youngflame clan’s Immortal
cultivators will arrive.” A voice rang out within Ning’s mind; it
was the voice of the spirit of the estate. Ning was now able to carry
the underwater estate with him at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He lifted his head,
staring at the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow continued to drift
in the skies above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I remember the last
time I left Swallow Mountain and went to Stillwater City…it was
winter then as well. Now, it’s winter again.” Ning shook his head
with a smile, then took a single step and disappeared from
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few moments
later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A warship came howling
through the air, leaving ‘waves’ of air in its wake. Aboard the
warship stood many armored Immortal cultivators. The watchers the
Youngflame clan had sent to Serpentwing Lake included Primal Daoists
and other soldiers as well. The Primal Daoists would be constantly
using their divine sense to scan the region every day. However, to
ensure that they wouldn’t simply be fooled by bewildering
formations that could affect their divine sense, they would also send
ordinary soldiers over to do visual inspections, to make sure that
their oversight was completely perfect.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_9___Foundation_Establish"></A>
Chapter 9 - Foundation Established
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The City of Ten
Thousand Swords, under the falling snow, remained as lively as ever.
The city had now become the very center of the entire Swallow
Mountain region; naturally, it was quite bustling! As for the grudge
between the Youngflame clan and the Ji clan? Those merchants and
peddlers who came and went from Swallow Mountain’s commandery
cities were all ordinary mortals; the Immortal cultivators stationed
by the Youngflame clan weren’t willing to wantonly slaughter too
many mortals, as that would cause the accumulation of far too much
sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a particular
alleyway in the City of Ten Thousand Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space rippled, and then
Ji Ning appeared. Although there were some ordinary mortals within
the alleyway, they didn’t seem to notice Ning’s presence at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These minor
invisibility tricks are still useful against mortals.” Ning spread
his sense out, and as he did, he couldn’t help but feel startled.
“The city is absolutely…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” A ripple of divine sense spread out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Duohe.”
Ning took a single step forward, then transformed into a gust of wind
and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord Prefect’s
estate was the heart of the entire city; it also comprised the inner
city. Within a particular courtyard in the estate. Immortals Duohe
and Witchsui were both seated here. A gust of wind blew in, then Ning
appeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” Two
other figures almost simultaneously appeared as well; it was the
Whitewater Hound and Little Qing. In the instant Ning had teleported
to the City of Ten Thousand Swords, Uncle White and Little Ning had
sensed his arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, it’s been
over a year.” Little Qing, in azure serpent form, immediately
coiled around Ning’s arm, then raised her little serpentine head
and spoke in the human tongue. “I’ve been worried to death over
you during this past year. The army of the Youngflame clan has been
sending nonstop patrols around. Fortunately, I could sense that you
were still alive, master; otherwise, I wouldn’t even be able to
sleep.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
looked at Ning. He, too, had been worried about Ning this entire
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, Little
Qing,” Ning laughed. “The Youngflame clan isn’t able to do
anything to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Duohe,
Immortal Witchsui.” Ning turned to look at the two already-standing
monstrous Immortals, then laughed. “I didn’t expect that after
being absent from here for a year, by the time of my return, your
forces would have layered it in protections that render it as
impregnable as an iron fortress. I sense more than a hundred
different types of formations alone, and wasn’t even able to
teleport into the city. Also, you discovered me as soon as I arrived;
this is an even more restrictive area than some headquarters for
major schools.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Duohe nodded.
“This is the core of your Ji clan, and the place where all of us
monsters of the Immortal estate world have gathered. Naturally, we
cannot be careless. We’ve used all our power to set up these
formations; so long as any Loose Immortal dares to enter, we will
immediately notice them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the homeland
of your Ji clan, and the home of our clans as well, for the next
thousand years,” Immortal Witchsui said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. He had been right to invite the monsters here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just that,”
Immortal Duohe chuckled, “Our clans have a vast number of Xiantian
lifeforms amid our ranks as well. We’ve sent out tens of thousands
these Xiantian Diremonsters to spread out throughout the Swallow
Mountain region, allowing us to completely control and oversee the
mortals here as well. This way, it will be hard for the Youngflame
clan to kill the mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It was a
grave sin to kill ordinary mortals, but Xiantian lifeforms had yet to
truly embark on the Immortal path; the amount of sin they accumulated
was much lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the decision
which we came to after negotiating with Old Patriarch Ninefire. The
Old Patriarch was worried that the Youngflame clan would butcher
ordinary mortals with abandon,” Immortal Duohe said. “Actually, I
feel that the Old Patriarch is worrying too much; the Youngflame clan
is, after all, a major clan that has existed for countless years.
Clans like this care tremendously about their karmic luck. Even if
they send Xiantian lifeforms to slaughter ordinary mortals, there
will still be some degree of sin that will surround the bodies of the
Youngflame clan members, which will affect the luck of the clan as a
whole. Although it won’t have a huge impact, given how much these
ancient clans care about luck, they absolutely wouldn’t do anything
that would negatively influence it, just for the sake of giving vent
to a bit of anger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Luck. You
couldn’t see it, nor could you feel it. But it did indeed exist.
Those blessed by luck were the favored of heaven, and their lives
would naturally be different. For example, the Grand Xia Dynasty
established the Raindragon Guard, whose primary mission was to
constantly capture and kill major sinners and thus allowing the
Dynasty’s luck to constantly rise!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll trouble you
all to take care of my Ji clan’s affairs,” Ning said. “I need
to go see the clan leader and the others. Afterwards, I’ll leave
the city, and it will most likely be many years before we meet
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, you must be careful,” Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe
both said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. And then, he led Uncle White and Little Qing to go see the
clan leader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire and the
others had no idea that Ning had returned. Soon, however, Ning’s
divine sense reached out to Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ji
Truekeep, who went to go meet with Ning, Uncle White, and Little Qing
in a secluded courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the door to
the courtyard shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and Truekeep all looked at Ning. Given they had secluded
themselves in this place, the conversation was undoubtedly a weighty
one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spread out his
divine sense as well, keeping a vigilant watch on the surrounding
area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are going to
leave the City of Ten Thousand Swords soon. I don’t know how long
this journey will last, or if I will be able to return,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, don’t say
such things; you’ll definitely be able to return,” Ninefire said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Alright.
I’ll definitely be able to return. Before leaving, there’s
something I want to give you all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ninefire and
the others were quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and the floor became filled with piles of magic treasures, such as
swords, spears, staffs, needles, shuttles, grand seals, ribbons, and
horsetail whisks. The treasures were numerous beyond counting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is?” Ninefire
and the others held their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his arm
again, and nearly thousand magic treasures appeared on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another wave of the
arm, and ten more treasures appeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are more than
ten thousand Mortal-ranked magic treasures, nine hundred-plus
Earth-ranked magic treasures, and twelve Heaven-ranked magic
treasures,” Ning said. “Even if our Ji clan produces several
Primal Daoists and a group of Wanxiang Adepts, these treasures should
be enough for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s enough, it’s
enough. Immortal cultivators usually acquire magic treasures through
adventuring in the outside world,” Ninefire said hurriedly. “At
most, the clan will provide a little bit of support. So many
treasures…Ning, son, where in the world did you get them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t answer.
Instead, he waved his hand again. A large number of spirit-pills and
valuable treasures and materials appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all
spirit-pills and valuable materials,” Ning said. “There are some
commonly seen Immortal elixirs and pills here. Clan leader, if you
flip through this book, you’ll know what is here. As for the most
precious spirit-pills and materials, I’ve written down a book
explaining their value and usage. You can’t be too wild in your use
of these things; after all, some of them are poisonous in nature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ninefire
and the others to all feel breathless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These magic
treasures are all external items.” Ning solemnly waved his hand,
and instantly, a vast, dense cluster of books appeared, filling more
than half of the hall and rising to thirty meters in height.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be our Dao
Repository,” Ning said. “It includes everything, and in number
should be even larger than Snowdragon Mountain’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had killed Xue
Hongyi, Youngflame Nong, and had also acquired the Dao Repository of
the Witchriver Immortal Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These eighteen sets
are the most important.” Ning waved his hand yet again. “Here
there are Immortal-ranked Ki Refining techniques, Fiendgod Body
Refining techniques, divine abilities, and divine will arts,” Ning
said. “These are precious techniques which Celestial Immortals and
those on their level use; some of them aren’t even available to the
Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Truekeep, and
Granny Shadow were all completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine abilities?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine will techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were things that
only existed in legendary Dao Repositories. Actually, these things
had been left behind both by Immortal Juhua and the Witchriver
Immortal Estate. Immortal Juhua had lived for millions of years,
after all, and his combat power was comparable to a Celestial
Immortal’s; he had acquired quite a few Dao Repositories in his
time. In other words, Ning’s repository was the combination of the
ones that had belonged to Immortal Witchriver and Immortal Juhua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua was a
lone wanderer with no clan to worry about, and so the techniques he
left behind were all top-notch, at least at the Heaven-rank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These eighteen sets
that I’m giving to you,” Ning said solemnly, “Absolutely must
not be taught to others. They are the hope for our Ji clan’s rise
to power, the heart of our heart. Who to pass them down to? When to
pass them down? I’ve left behind my recommendations on this book.”
Ning handed a book directly over to Truekeep. Truekeep, hands
trembling, accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was completely
stunned. Perhaps this repository was quite a bit weaker than the Dao
Repository which the Black-White College had accumulated over the
course of countless years, but it definitely far surpassed the likes
of Snowdragon Mountain, and definitely ranked amongst the top ten or
so of the entire Stillwater Commandery. Those divine abilities and
secret arts in particular…the other powers didn’t have them at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. Ning waved his
hand yet again, and a pile of statues appeared. A total of nine
golems, all of Qiongqi Manticores.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The nine
Qiongqi Manticore golems all looked towards Ning with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had originally
acquired thirty-six Qiongqi golems and the black-armored male golem
from the Witchriver Immortal Estate. The giant yellow bear had
completely disassembled them, then rebuilt them into eighteen Qiongqi
golems. As for that black-armored male golem? He was completely,
truly finished; he no longer existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the retrofitting
of the eighteen Qiongqi golems, every single one of them was now
close to a Loose Immortal in combat power. Nine of them could join
together to form into a ‘Grand Nine Heavens Formation’, and even
Ning’s Primaltwin fighting at full power still found it hard to
overcome them when surrounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These nine golems
are each close to a Loose Immortal in combat power. For a single one
to actually kill a Primal Daoist on its own might be difficult,”
Ning said, “But once the nine join forces into a golem
formation…they will be able to kill Primal Daoists as easily as
killing chickens. This will become our Ji clan’s final trump card.
Every single one of them has an elemental ki formation within their
bodies, and they can absorb natural elemental energy and distill it
into liquefied elemental essence, so there’s no need for you to
provide them with a power supply. However, remember this…don’t
use them too often. Once they use up the essence inside, they will no
longer be able to fight. You can ask them yourself how much energy
they have remaining and how much longer they can fight for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Primal Daoists
as easily as killing chickens?” Ninefire, Truekeep, and Granny
Shadow exchanged a glance. They were completely filled with joy by
this situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Ninefire
said hurriedly, “I know about golems. Such powerful, mighty golems
are incomparably valuable; it’s better to keep them by your side.
You will be experiencing countless dangers; these golems will be of
great use to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For me, killing
Primal Daoists is also as easy as killing chickens,” Ning said..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the others
were speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words were simply
too savage and brutal. If Ning dared to say these words, that meant
he absolutely had the combat power of a Loose Immortal! Actually,
Ning’s true body wasn’t that strong, but his Primaltwin? It
definitely did have that power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and collect
these,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.
Truekeep, hurry up and collect them,” Ninefire said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep nodded. “These
treasures cannot leave the City of Ten Thousand Swords; in fact, they
can’t even leave the Lord Prefect’s manor. I’ll allow these
nine Loose Immortal golems to guard them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything had been
arranged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the hall
swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Uncle White
and Little Qing out, transforming into a gust of wind that
disappeared into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep, Ninefire, and
Granny Shadow raised their heads, staring into the firmament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan’s
foundation has been established. So long as we are given enough time,
we will definitely become one of the local hegemons of Stillwater
Commandery.” Ninefire murmured silently to himself, “Although my
life is coming to an end…it’s enough…it’s enough. Even in
death, my life will have been worth it. Yichuan…I knew your son was
formidable, but not that he was this formidable! You produced a fine
son!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep and Granny
Shadow were both in a stunned state as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They both
understood…that because of the things Ji Ning had left behind
today, the Ji clan now had a powerful foundation. Like seeds entering
fertile mud, the only thing left to do was to wait. All they needed
now…was time!

Chapter 10 - Imperial Capital of the Grand Xia
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimson Dragon
Mountains. The local branch of the Raindragon Guard. The enormous,
tower-shaped teleportation array. There was a white-robed elder
seated in the lotus position next to it, quietly waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as the
Youngflame clan’s hatred for Ji Ning is truly bone-deep. They
instructed me long ago to help keep an eye out, and to immediately
inform them upon discovering him.” Ten servants near the
teleportation array were whispering and laughing amongst themselves.
“And yet, they also sent one of the Raindragon Guards belonging to
their clan to stay here permanently and keep watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been over a
year. Ji Ning definitely left Stillwater Commandery long ago, but
this Raindragon Guard of the Youngflame clan is still waiting here
like an idiot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone says that
Ji Ning killed that young master ‘Youngflame Nong’; how could the
Youngflame clan not be enraged? Stillwater Commandery is Ji Ning’s
homeland, and this teleportation array of ours is the largest one
within Stillwater Commandery, capable of sending someone to any place
in the Grand Xia Empire. They are definitely going to stay on watch
here permanently.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the two
servants were chatting, the teleportation array suddenly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is coming.”
The ten servants all turned their heads to look. As for the
white-robed elder who had been in the lotus position this entire
time, he opened his eyes out of habit. He had been on watch here for
far too long, but each time the teleportation array lit up or someone
used the array to leave, he would still pay attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fur-clad youth
appeared within the teleportation array. On his arm was a little
azure serpent, while by his side was a large, snowy white dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The ten
servants responsible for maintaining the teleportation array, as well
as the distant, lotus-seated white-robed elder, all called out in
shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fur-clad youth? An
azure snake? A large, snowy white dog? This was…a perfect match!
And he looked identical to Ji Ning as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He, is he Ji Ning?”
The white-robed elder couldn’t help but look towards those ten
servants of the array. What his thinking was, even if Ji Ning was
going to use the teleportation array, he would most likely do it in
secret! For example, he might change his appearance, change his
clothes, and temporarily hide his spirit-beasts, making others unable
to see that it was him. For Ji Ning to suddenly appear without any
disguises at all…this actually made it so that he couldn’t
believe what he was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Could it be a fake?”
The white-robed elder suddenly had this thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s him. He’s
Ji Ning.” Those ten servants of the array all spoke out. “We met
him several times before. There’s no mistake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I am Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad youth
stood there within the formation, sweeping those ten with his gaze.
The ten were so frightened, they hurriedly took several steps back.
This was a branch of the Raindragon Guard; if Ji Ning dared to kill
someone, he would become a wanted criminal and be pursued! They all
knew that the chances of him attacking were very low, but when they
thought about the fact that he was already being pursued by the
Youngflame clan, they felt that he might be capable of doing
anything. Naturally, these ten servants felt a bit of dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone,” Ning
said. “I am going to the imperial capital. Please activate the
teleportation array.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial
capital?” The ten servants were amazed. He wasn’t going to flee
to a distant place; instead, he was going to the very heart of the
Grand Xia Empire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you going to
activate it or not?” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” After a
brief moment of surprise, the ten calmed down. No matter what, the
grudge between the Youngflame clan and Ji Ning was a private matter.
Ji Ning was still nominally a Raindragon Guard; they could not bar
his way to the imperial capital. The ten immediately began to make
minor adjustments to the teleportation array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a moment. I’m
going to the imperial capital as well.” The white-robed elder
immediately walked over, stepping into the teleportation array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the
white-robed elder exchanged glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite bold,”
the white-robed elder said in a low voice. “It’s been more than a
year, but you actually have dared to return in Stillwater
Commandery!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my homeland.
Why wouldn’t I dare to return?” Ning gave him a sidelong glance.
“Did you actually wait here for me this entire time? Poor bastard.”
This man’s strength was ordinary; after scanning him with divine
sense, Ning estimated that he probably should be a Wanxiang Adept. It
was also possible that he vastly surpassed Ning, causing Ning to be
completely unable to tell how terrifyingly strong he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the attunement
towards the Dao which Ning’s divine sense now had, to make it so
that even he couldn’t discover anything at all…the man would have
to be at least at the Celestial Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But clearly, there was
no way this watchman could have been a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve returned to
Stillwater Commandery. And now, after revealing your whereabouts, you
plan to go straight to the imperial capital? Hmph, hmph. Ji Ning, you
won’t be able to escape. Those who my Youngflame clan wish to kill
will definitely die,” the white-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, is that so? Then
hurry up and kill me,” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
we’ve finished our adjustments to the teleportation array. We will
send you to the imperial capital now.” The ten servants, while
speaking, stepped back and activated the array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the teleportation
array lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The array was now
empty. Everything inside had vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. This was the very core of this entire major world. It
was truly a place where the fish swam with the dragons, where experts
were as common as the clouds. In terms of size of commandery cities
or number of experts, compared to the imperial capital…Stillwater
Commandery was nothing more than a backwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a tall, towering
mountain within the imperial capital. This was the tallest mountain
within the imperial capital, and its name…was Raindragon Godpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon Godpeak
was the most towering edifice present. Even the tallest building of
the imperial citadel, the Skylight Palace, was slightly lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Raindragon Godpeak was
ten thousand kilometers high, while the Skylight Palace of the
imperial citadel was 9999 kilometers high! These were the two most
towering structures of the imperial capital…and in fact, there were
no buildings in the entire Grand Xia Empire which were taller than
these two. Correct - buildings! In truth, the Raindragon Godpeak,
while nominally a ‘mountain’, was actually an enormous magic
treasure building!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up Raindragon
Godpeak, there were numerous, enormous teleportation arrays. This was
the center of this major world, and in fact, it was to here where
those from other major worlds would come!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In one of the many
teleportation arrays halfway up the mountain. Suddenly, a number of
people appeared. There was a white-robed elder, a fur-clad youth, a
little azure snake, and a large snowy white dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s Ji Ning.
Hurry up and make the report.” As soon as the white-robed elder
appeared, he turned his gaze to two armored men in a higher part of
the mountain and sent a mental message to them. These two armored men
were on permanent station here, and were responsible for welcoming
the guests of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The two
armored warriors were shocked. They exchanged a glance, and then one
of them immediately flew down from his position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, with Little Qing
and Uncle White by his side, leisurely strolled over towards the edge
of the cliff. From this position, he could stare down and marvel at
the vast, endless imperial city. As he stared down…there was
actually not a cloud to be seen. Although he was more than three
thousand kilometers in the air, when he looked downwards, he didn’t
see any clouds at all, nor was there any smoke or dust; nothing
hindered his vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From their vantage
point, an enormous, awe-inspiring commandery city could be seen, a
city that seemed to have no end. Far away, there was a towering,
massive Immortal palace that was as large as this mountain. This was
the place the Emperor of the Grand Xia normally resided; the Skylight
Palace. The Skylight Palace, 9999 kilometers tall, was a single
massive magic treasure. It emanated all sorts of brilliant, blinding
light; golden light, silver light, red light, azure light, violet
light…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The streams of light
shone over the entire imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the highers point of
the Skylight Palace, starting at roughly six thousand kilometers or
so, fog and mist could be seen, as well as a layer of incomparably
beautiful red clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is said that the
Skylight Palace of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia is 9999
kilometers high. At 6000 kilometers, there is a layer of red clouds,
with multiple other layers of clouds beyond that, for a total of nine
layers! In terms of power and prestige…it can absolutely compare to
the Sacred Palace of the Skies 1 of the Heaven Realm. That’s what
is said…and today, I can see that it truly is extraordinary.”
Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are so high.
Everyone says that both the Skylight Palace and Raindragon Godpeak
are magic treasures,” Little Qing called out in amazement. “Look
at the infinite light the Skylight Palace is giving off…that power
and might…if such a massive palace is actually a magic treasure,
what level of magic treasure is it?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal-ranked at
the very least, and most likely Pure Yang-ranked,” Ning said
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Little Qing
and Uncle White, flying down from the mountain. Whoosh! They flew
along the wind, staring down at the seemingly endless imperial
capital and feeling completely stunned. This was no mortal city…this
was a city which should only exist in the Heaven Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to legend,
Immortal Eastroam, ‘Dong You’, once led the Immortals and
Fiendgods of a major world to assault the Heaven Realm, forcing that
power of the Heaven Realm to lower their heads and allow him to
reunite with his beloved.” Ning sighed, moved. “As I look at the
power of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia…I now believe that
an emperor of a major world does indeed have this level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had realized some
time ago that in the books regarding the Heaven Realm and the
Netherworld Kingdom, it seemed as though the Celestial Emperor wasn’t
viewed as being tremendously important. It seemed as though the
emperors of major worlds were completely qualified to sit down and
chat with the Celestial Emperor as equals. This was the feeling which
Ning had after reading those books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flew down
Raindragon Godpeak, landing on a long street that seemed to be made
from clouds. They saw, atop this massive street, countless people
either flying on magic treasures, riding flying carriages, or mounted
on spirit-beasts. Not a single mortal could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look backwards; behind him was the seemingly infinitely tall
Raindragon Godpeak. “Raindragon Godpeak is actually slightly taller
than even the Skylight Palace. The Skylight Palace is the place where
the Emperor of the Grand Xia resides, whereas Raindragon Godpeak is
nothing more than the headquarters of the Raindragon Guard. Why have
they been raised to such an exalted status?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
puzzled. The height of a building had to conform to exacting
requirements; for the Skylight Palace to be 9999 kilometers tall
meant that no one in any of the other commandery cities would dare to
construct a building of such heights. But Raindragon Godpeak was
actually slightly higher…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial capital
lives up to its reputation,” Ning said. “Come, let’s go wander
about the city.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning no longer pondered
this matter. He immediately produced a construct-carriage. It
appeared, surrounded by mist, with a black dragon construct pulling
it. This carriage had been left behind by Youngflame Nong! Although
Immortal Juhua had left behind far more treasures than Youngflame
Nong, including fine Immortal carriages as well, Ning decided it was
best to be a bit low-key.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black
dragon carriage flew forward, with Ning seated in the carriage, an
azure snake on one side and the Whitewater Hound on the other. Soon,
the carriage reached the walls of the imperial city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial city was
surrounded by a wall that was more than thirty thousand meters high.
It had an enormous gate, and the gate was guarded by four
human-shaped Fiendgods that were also thirty thousand meters tall. Of
the four Fiendgods, the first had red skin and flames coming out of
his nostrils, the second had azure skin and was surrounded by watery
mist, the third gleamed with golden light and had a sharp golden
gaze, while the fourth was completely pitch-black and had a giant
snake wrapped around its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These four Fiendgods
guarded the city gate. Regardless of entry or exit, they had to first
give permission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My God.” Ning
stared at these four titanic Fiendgods. He couldn’t help but shake
in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, those four
Fiendgods, it, it feels as though each of them are comparable to that
one from the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains.” Little Qing and
Uncle White sighed in amazement as well.

Chapter 11 - A Major Business Deal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital.
Within the Youngflame clan’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” An
azure-robed middle-aged man flew in a rush into a study, then knelt
down, unable to mask the excitement on his face. “We’ve found Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke, who
was seated behind a table, flipping through a book, was stunned upon
hearing this. And then, he called out in delight, “Found Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been more than a
year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per the orders from
Patriarch Arcanum, the Godplume Duke had been searching for Ji Ning’s
traces this entire time, but Ji Ning seemed to have completely
disappeared, leaving behind no traces behind at all. In fact, the
Godplume Duke actually believed that Ji Ning had perhaps hidden
himself within another lesser world or major world. In fact, he had
thought that ten or twenty years might go by without any traces of Ji
Ning being discovered. For Ji Ning to kill the successor to the
Youngflame clan and then leave completely unhindered was a
humiliation to the entire Youngflame clan…but if they couldn’t
find him, what could they do about it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, they actually
found him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is he?” The
Godplume Duke immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has already
arrived here in the imperial capital. We followed him the entire
time,” the azure-robed man said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial
capital? He came to the imperial capital?” The Godplume Duke
frowned. The imperial capital was tightly guarded, and here in the
imperial capital, without a shadow of a doubt the most powerful
organization was the imperial clan of the Grand Xia. For Ji Ning to
come to the imperial capital actually made things more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually came to
the imperial capital. Fighting is forbidden in the imperial
capital…what should we do about him, then?” The Godplume Duke
continued to frown. In some other commandery cities, the Youngflame
had quite a large amount of influence, but in the imperial capital,
there were quite a few clans more powerful than the Youngflame
clan…and in the end, there was the Imperial Xiamang clan, which had
completely unified this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of the
Imperial Xiamang clan, even the supremely powerful clans such as the
Youngflame clan, the Kindwater clan, and the Skyfarmer clan had to
tread carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning must be
followed continuously. Keep a close watch on his movements,” the
Godplume Duke ordered. “Don’t do anything else for now; just
await my orders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
azure-robed man immediately acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that
Patriarch Arcanum had originally ordered for Ji Ning to be killed
immediately upon him being found, but this was the imperial capital!
To kill someone inside the capital…this was a challenge to the
Imperial Xiamang clan! The only way to do it was to send out
Deathsworn, Deathsworn who wouldn’t betray the Youngflame clan even
after being captured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how tightly
guarded the imperial capital is, once the battle starteds, most
likely in the space of a single breath, the Imperial Guard of the
Grand Xia will immediately arrive,” the Godplume Duke pondered to
himself. “To find a Deathsworn who can kill Ji Ning in just the
space of a single breath…where am I supposed to find such a
Deathsworn? Ji Ning has acquired many of Youngflame Nong’s
treasures!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was powerful to
begin with. Given that he had protective treasures on him as well,
even Loose Immortals would find it hard to defeat him in such a short
period of time. A Deathsworn like this would be very difficult to
find.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go see the
Patriarch.” The Godplume Duke no longer hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the nine Flood
Dragons flew outwards, pulling an Immortal carriage behind them with
the Godplume Duke seated within it. They howled through the air,
leaving the imperial capital and entering the azure skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Filled with curiosity,
Ning continued to stare at the imperial citadel, and also at the
distant Skylight Palace. Alas, given Ning’s status, how could he
possibly be allowed to enter the imperial ccitadel? And so, a few
moments later, his black dragon carriage flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, there are
three people behind us now,” Little Qing glanced backwards. Ning,
seated within the carriage, glanced backwards as well. There was a
long shuttle behind them, with a white-robed elder and two others on
it. Earlier, the only one following them had been the white-robed
elder, but now, there were three in total.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One is a Primal
Daoist.” Ning could feel those behind him reaching out through
divine sense, and he immediately sent his own divine sense crushing
backwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Soulshaker Art]! Their
divine senses collided, and instantly, the face of the tall, thin,
azure-robed man changed. “This Ji Ning actually has such a powerful
soul?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the divine sense
collision, the three behind Ning immediately grew much more
‘obedient’, no longer trying to challenge him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, where
shall we go next?” The Whitewater Hound sent through their
spirit-link.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain,” Ning sent back through their spirit-link as
well. “I’ve acquired quite a few treasures this time; the amount
of magic treasures alone is quite astonishing. With so many magic
treasures…I should go to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to
exchange them for liquefied elemental essence, then trade for
treasures I actually need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, what Ning
needed the most desperately was treasures which contained the
purified essences of the Five Elements, so that he could begin
training on the second Cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black dragon
carriage advanced at an astonishing speed through the wide streets.
The streets of the imperial capital were all extremely wide. The
several major thoroughfares were actually built and ‘tiled’ with
clouds, causing them to seem extraordinarily beautiful. Even the
ordinary streets were tiled with incredibly rare and precious stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The main
headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain lives up to its
name.” Ning’s eyes lit up as he stared into the distance. The
other Heavenly Treasures Mountains in the various commandery cities
were merely local branches; this one here in the imperial capital was
the true center. Many of the most rare and precious curios were all
stored here in the main headquarters. Many Immortals would come to
the imperial capital expressly for the purpose of purchasing items at
the main headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain that could
not be found elsewhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is huge.”
Little Qing’s eyes were filled with excitement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
raised his head as well. He had never before seen such a beautiful
place. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain before them was structured
like an enormous qilin creature which lay there, nearly ten thousand
kilometers long. In other words, the size of this Heavenly Treasures
Mountain was comparable to the entire Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black dragon
carriage quickly flew into the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s first get
something to eat, then sell off our treasures.” Ning was in a
superb mood. He paid no attention to those three following him, and
the black dragon carriage flew straight in, under the guidance of the
greeters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main headquarters
of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain was filled with enormous
crystalline mirrors which hung in the air everywhere, nearly covering
the entirety of the sky at a height of tens of kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath the countless
mirmrors, many Immortal cultivators were congregating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing flew into the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, one
of the mirrors quickly locked onto them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black dragon
carriage, the one used by young master Youngflame Nong of the
Youngflame clan. Youngflame Nong has already been killed by Ji
Ning..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rider on the
carriage is dressed in magic robes in the shape of furs, and looks
identical to Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next to him are two
Godbeasts; Azure Skysnake and Whitewater Hound.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“99% chance of the
youth being Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This report was quickly
duplicated and spread out, and as it was, it was sent out through one
of the thousands of intelligence channels. This was a location under
constant surveillance by the main headquarters, as every day, all
sorts of figures would arrive, including those from other major
worlds or even the Heaven Realm or the Netherworld Kingdom. All sorts
of intelligence reports could be generated here, of greater or lesser
import. As for the news of Ji Ning…in the eyes of the many
intelligence agencies, he was very unremarkable and ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has already
appeared within the main headquarters of our Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. There are five customers who have a standing purchase order
for all information regarding him. Immediately deliver these reports
to them.” A black-robed woman gave a calm order, and soon, the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain sent out five subordinates, each with a
copy of an intelligence report, towards five different locations in
the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately report Ji
Ning’s whereabouts upon discovering him! There were five customers
who had standing purchase orders of this nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the
Blackwater Carriage?” Within the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, a
violet-robed man stared into the distance as Ning, aboard his
carriage, entered a private courtyard. The black dragon carriage
brought him all the way into the courtyard, then Ning entered a
two-story building within the estate, sitting down alongside Little
Qing and Uncle White to enjoy some of delicacies that came from
places throughout the Grand Xia Empire, and even from some other
major worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fur-clad youth?
Azure Skysnake? Whitewater Hound?” The violet-robed man murmured to
himself, “Can this be the Ji Ning who killed Youngflame Nong? He
truly is ignorant, to dare to so be so arrogant and open…he’s
probably already been discovered by the intelligence division, and
the Youngflame clan will most likely quickly be aware of him as well.
However, none of that has anything to do with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong was
quite wealthy. Ji Ning killed him…and must have taken his many
treasures. It seems my opportunity has come.” The violet-robed
man’s eyes lit up, and he immediately, leisurely walked forward. A
few moments later, he arrived outside the courtyard. He stood there,
outside the courtyard, waiting silently, not entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it outside?”
Ning’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Qi of the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain,” the violet-robed man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed man
obediently entered, quickly arriving at that two-story building. He
followed the stairs up to the second floor, where Ji Ning, an
azure-robed maiden, and a white-robed man were seated. They had
essentially finished eating..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were outside the
courtyard for quite some time. What for?” Ning leisurely held a cup
of wine in his hand, sweeping this Yu Qi with a weighing gaze. Yu
Qi’s power…from what Ning could tell, he should be at the
Wanxiang level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am responsible for
purchasing and selling treasures on behalf of the main Heavenly
Treasures Mountain,” Yu Qi said modestly. “For example, if some
people wish to sell their treasures or want to buy something special,
I can assist. And of course, for the deals that I was responsible for
carrying out, the main Heavenly Treasures Mountain will give me some
rewards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
“You recognize me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi laughed. “I
immediately recognized that carriage that you rode on, fellow Daoist
Ji Ning. The carriage is known as the ‘Blackwater Carriage’, and
was used in the past by Youngflame Nong; he often rode in it to come
to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Thus, quite a few people
recognize it. Upon seeing the carriage, seeing the way you look, and
the Azure Skysnake and Whitewater Hound by your side, I was able to
guess that you are the ‘legendary’ Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’m quite
famous. Even the imperial capital knows about me.” Ning couldn’t
help but laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, you might not be aware of this, but you are indeed quite
well-known,” Yu Qi laughed. “Youngflame Nong was one of the Four
Dukelings of the imperial capital. Although they were described as
the Four Dukelings, they weren’t necessarily the most powerful
individuals of their generation; however, they had exalted statuses,
were extremely wealthy, and loved to have fun. Youngflame Nong,
however, ended up dying in the outside world. This news was naturally
picked up by interested parties. Although the Youngflame clan never
publicized it, anyone who did just a bit of investigation would
realize that the killer was Ji Ning. Thus, your information was
quickly unearthed by many as well. You have as spirit-beasts a
Whitewater Hound and an Azure Skysnake; you like to dress in
fur-shaped magic robes; you are extremely talented in swordplay, and
have the appearance of a delicate, handsome youth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi rambled on and
on, while Ji Ning, Little Qing, and Uncle White just stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though
after having killing Youngflame Nong, he truly had become quite
well-known in the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…and I guessed
that the reason you came here today, fellow Daoist Ji Ning, was to
sell off some treasures,” Yu Qi laughed. “And I, here at the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain, specialize in this sort of business.”
</P>

Chapter 12 - Tears
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
someone suddenly knocked at the door. “Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, might
I come in?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Qi
frowned. This voice was quite familiar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short, chubby old man
walked in, also dressed in violet. The man looked towards Ning and
bowed. “Hawkart greets you, fellow Daoist Ji Ning.” He smiled
casually towards Yu Qi. “Yu Qi, you came quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Hawkart, you actually discovered fellow Daoist Ji Ning so quickly.
I’m quite surprised.” Yu Qi let out a cold snort. Both of them
were responsible for dealing in the treasure trade. Everyone loved
treasures, especially rare ones. When absolutely unique,
one-of-a-kind treasures were discovered, the main Heavenly Treasures
Mountain would go and collect them and offer them only to the
imperial clan, not selling them to outsiders. That was why some of
the major clans and sects, in order to avoid certain precious
treasures from being completely monopolized by the imperial clan,
would also collect many treasures and keep them internally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
Northmont clan of Stillwater had the ‘Carefree Caverns’, which
was secretly collecting precious items as well. And in turn, the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain had a number of people who were
responsible for befriending experts and acquiring treasures from
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t
‘discover’ fellow Daoist Ji Ning; it was he who declared his
interest in selling treasures, which is why I learned of this,” the
violet-robed elder laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seated there,
said calmly, “I came to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain this time
for the purpose of selling treasures. Thus, I had already instructed
the attendant to make it known. I imagine that fellow Daoist Hawkart
was notified by the attendant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi now understood.
The short elder said proactively, “Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, if you
sell your treasures to me, I will definitely give you a price that
satisfies you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t really
care who I sell them to. To me, this is but a small matter.” Ning
looked at the two. After entering into a feud with the Youngflame
clan, Ning’s Dao-heart had improved considerably, and the two in
front of him weren’t able to entice him at all. “I know quite
well that the most common treasures are always purchased at 60% of
actual value by the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi and the short
elder both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go to
a larger location.” Ning rose to his feet. “As for who I will
sell the treasures to, we can discuss that in a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way, please.”
“After you.” Yu Qi and the short elder both responded with
warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, they
arrived within a large garden, where only maidservants were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi and the short
elder were both dressed in violet robes. Upon their entrance, the
maidservants immediately left obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, how about this garden? Large enough?” Yu Qi glanced at the
surrounding area. “Generally speaking, when Loose Immortals trade
with us, they’ll come to this type of location.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the area
with his gaze. In the center of the garden, there was a gazebo, next
to which was nearly a three hundred meter region of polished stone,
surrounded by precious flowers of all types.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll work.”
Ning nodded, then waved his hand. Instantly, an awe-inspiringly
massive pile of magic treasures appeared on the ground. There were
more than a hundred thousand Mortal-ranked, ten thousand
Earth-ranked, and a hundred-plus Heaven-ranked. “First calculate as
to roughly how much these treasures are worth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi and the short
elder both took deep breaths. This many treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just a
portion,” Ning said calmly. “I’ll sell them to whoever gives me
the best price. Oh, right; if I recall correctly, as long as the
value of a business deal reaches two hundred and fifty thousand
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, one can receive a ‘Xia’
insignia, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yu Qi and
the short elder didn’t hesitate at all. “Fellow Daoist Ji Ning,
don’t worry at all; we will definitely give you a ‘Xia’
insignia.” Just by a quick visual appraisal, they could tell that
the treasures in front of them definitely exceeded the necessary
value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Uncle White, and
Little Qing sat down within the gazebo, leisurely sipping wine and
laughing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh.
The magic treasures were quickly divided by type. Yu Qi and the short
elder both carefully assessed every single magic treasure. Since the
main Heavenly Treasures Mountain employed them to deal in treasures,
they were clearly no ordinary Wanxiang Adepts. Each of them had
memorized the prices of hundreds of millions of types of magic
treasures and items, as well as the details regarding them. Their
memories, naturally, were unfathomably superior to the memories of
ordinary mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it took them a
full hour before they finally came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mortal-ranked
treasures would round up to be 40,600 kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence. The Earth-ranked treasures are approximately
252,500 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. As for the
Heaven-ranked, the highest price I can give is roughly 560,000
kilograms,” Yu Qi said. “A final price of 853,100 kilograms for
everything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can give you
855,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence,” the short elder
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me too,” Yu Qi
said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Any
higher prices?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi and the short
elder exchanged glances, secretly feeling hateful towards each other.
Ning just laughed. Actually, most of these were mass produced magic
treasures, and so the price that could be offered for them was set in
stone. Those hundred or so Heaven-ranked treasures, however, did
include a few that should have been personally produced by an
Immortal, and thus were priced differently and with some fluctuation.
Still, the overall price wouldn’t change much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s the
price for the treasures, eh?” Ning waved his hand again. “I have
quite a few more treasures here as well. Give me a calculation and an
offer; the magic treasures and these curios will go to the high
bidder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground was
instantly filled with a huge amount of Immortal grass, spirit-pills,
protective curios, and other such items. These protective items were
useful for Youngflame Nong, but with Ning now having a Primaltwin,
Ning’s combat power was now comparable to a Loose Immortals, and so
the treasures were useless to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Qi and the
short elder’s syees lit up. Immortal grass, spirit-pills, and
protective curios?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was some degree
of fluctuation in the price of treasures that couldn’t be
mass-produced. They would be able to make the most profit from these
items. As for those magic treasures…although there was a high
number of them, there was very little margin to be made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow. He
really did take out all of Youngflame Nong’s treasures,” Yu Qi
murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been quite a
while since I’ve seen so many nice items,” the short elder said,
his eyes shining as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two rapidly began
to calculate while pondering internally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The magic treasures,
combined with these various other treasures…I can offer you
1,300,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence!” Yu Qi gritted
his teeth, then made the offer. “If this old fellow gives a higher
price, then I’ll bow out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder was
stunned. He stared at Yu Qi in amazement. “Are you mad?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
amazed as well. Ning had actually already had an estimate in mind
regarding the value of the medicinal items and magic treasures he had
taken from the Witchriver Immortal Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you beat that
offer?” Yu Qi stared at the short elder, savagery in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh, I’m too old
for this.” The short elder shook his head and sighed. “I don’t
dare act as crazily as you. Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, I bid you
farewell. Yu Qi, the end of my life will be coming soon. Let me offer
you a few words of advice; don’t be too crazy. If you wager too
heavily, you might end up losing yourself.” The short elder turned
his head and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at Yu Qi.
“1,300,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yu Qi
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
laughed. He couldn’t be bothered with the interactions between the
two; what mattered was getting the liquefied elemental essence into
his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, the two
carried out their trade. The treasures went to Yu Qi, while Ning
acquired the 1,300,000 kilograms, as well as a Xia insignia. This
represented that Ning was like most Loose Immortals, qualified to
purchase magic treasures at a 40% discount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” After having completed the transaction, Yu Qi’s face was
ruddy with excitement. “It’s almost night. At nightfall, the
monthly Treasure Auction will begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure Auction?”
Ning nodded, but didn’t look too interested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Treasure
Auction of the main headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
The major powers of this world, and in fact many lone wanderer Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals will deliver their treasures to this
Treasure Auction,” Yu Qi said. “In fact, even Immortal-ranked
magic treasures might appear, along with many other hard-to-purchase
items. If you have time, you should make an appearance at the
Treasure Auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued. It
was worth a visit; perhaps he might find essence extracts of the Five
Elements. He immediately said, “Will members of the Youngflame clan
participate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan?
That’s a major clan; they will definitely send someone to
participate in the monthly auction,” Yu Qi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Tonight, I’ll
pay a visit.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. Within King Yan’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone conferred the
title of ‘King’ was definitely someone who had an extremely high
status within the imperial Xiamang clan. After all, the Xiamang clan
had existed for countless years; as the chief of this major world,
they had countless offspring, but extremely few who would receive the
title of ‘King’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess, Princess!”
An armored female soldier charged towards a residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can come up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two stories
to this residence. On the second floor, a green-robed woman was
seated, against the railing, staring at the garden below. The garden
was filled with some stones, sand, and even had a small lake; it
looked just like a little beach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess.” The
female soldier fell to one knee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman
seemed a bit fragile and weak, but the look in her eyes caused the
female soldier to feel dread. The green-robed woman said calmly,
“Speak. What is it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A report from the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain,” the female soldier said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain?” The green-robed woman was startled, then
immediately said, “Hand it over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
armored female soldier immediately offered the report over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman
accepted it, then opened it. Upon seeing the details regarding Ji
Ning within the scroll, she couldn’t help but tremble, then murmur
to herself, “Ji Ning? Came to the imperial capital of the Grand
Xia? Is at the Heavenly Treasures Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single tear suddenly
fell down onto the scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the
green-robed woman suddenly seem to come to her senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahahaha…” The
green-robed woman suddenly began to laugh. She immediately rose to
her feet, then shouted, “Transmit my orders. The Golden Imperials
are to prepare to accompany me to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are summoning
the Golden Imperials?” The armored female soldier was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
gone yet?!” The green-robed woman snapped at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right away.” The
armored female soldier didn’t dare to hesitate; she immediately
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the grene-robed
woman, she excitedly paced back and forth within the residence, her
body trembling slightly as she murmured to herself, “The only child
left behind by Aunt…my little cousin, my one and only little
cousin…you’ve finally arrived. I, your big sister, am finally
going to see you. Finally. I definitely won’t let the Youngflame
clan harm a hair on your head. Definitely not!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess.” The
voice of a female soldier, calling from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman
turned her head, and then her body flickered as she flew out
gracefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a carriage that
was completely wreathed in golden flames and which was pulled by two
enormous azure phoenixes flew out. In front and behind the carriage
was a crowd of Golden Imperials, all of whom had heroic, vigorous
auras and who seemed to move as one. Clouds naturally manifested in
the area around them, and the Golden Imperials all flew forward,
striding on the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure phoenixes, to
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain,” the green-robed woman said,
seated within the carriage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Princess.”
One of the azure phoenixes spoke out in the human tongue. Immediately
afterwards, the two phoenixes began to pull the carriage forward.
Escorted by the Golden Imperials, they immediately flew towards the
main Heavenly Treasures Mountain.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Escorted by a ring of
Golden Imperials, the azure phoenixes pulled the Immortal carriage to
the main Heavenly Treasures Mountain. As they arrived, the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain proactively sent someone out to welcome them;
after all, this was the exalted Princess Xiyue of King Yan’s
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Xiyue.” A white-robed, fairy-like maiden with an extraordinary aura
that stuck out from the crowd went to welcome her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister
Azurewillow.” Princess Xiyue emerged from the Immortal carriage,
revealing a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister Xiyue,
why have you come to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain? You come here
quite rarely. I was planning to go visit you in a few days,” the
white-robed maiden, Azurewillow, laughed. Fairy Azurewillow…she was
a reincarnated female Immortal, and in the past, she had been a Loose
Immortal of the Skyfarmer clan. After reincarnating, she had once
more been reborn into the Skyfarmer clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurewillow, a Primal
Daoist, was an extremely high ranking member of the main headquarters
of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, and a very close friend of
Princess Xiyue’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to come and
take a look, so I did.” Princess Xiyue and Azurewillow linked arms
together. Clouds emerged beneath their feet, leading them forward
towards a particularly wide hallway. Most ordinary guests, such as
Ning, entered through an ordinary hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should’ve come
a long time ago. You always stay cooped up within the king’s
estate. Don’t you feel stifled there? I feel stifled for you!”
Azurewillow felt that this good friend of hers, Princess Xiyue, was
excellent in all areas save for one; she was a bit too solitary. When
the younger generation members of the various major clans located in
the imperial capital of the Grand Xia met together, they would often
discuss Princess Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were simply too
many imperial descendants, and so ‘princes’ and ‘princesses’
had varying levels of status. King Yan, however, only had a single
family member, Princess Xiyue, and so he doted heavily on her. Thus,
her own status naturally became extremely high as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people
believed…that the reason why Princess Xiyue was so solitary was
because of her childhood. This was because no one knew about what she
had experienced as a child; all they knew was that when King Yan
brought Princess Xiyue back, she was already a grown woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Help me look
into something,” Princess Xiyue said. “Someone named Ji Ning
should’ve come to your Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Help me
investigate and see where this Ji Ning is currently located? He
should still be within your Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Azurewillow
smiled, then stretched her divine sense out a few hundred kilometers,
giving the instructions to a subordinate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems, Xiyue,
that you came because of this Ji Ning. Ji Ning…the only person of
this name that I can think of is that disciple of the Black-White
College of Stillwater Province, who killed Youngflame Nong,”
Azurewillow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the one.”
Princess Xiyue revealed a smile as well. “I’m quite curious about
him. He actually dared to kill Youngflame Nong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m quite
intrigued by him as well,” Azurewillow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Found him.”
Azurewillow said, “Ji Ning is at Fortunes Peak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunes Peak? Then
let’s go to Fortunes Peak,” Princess Xiyue said directly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main Heavenly
Treasures Mountain took up an extremely large amount of space. There
were many mountain peaks within it, and the top of the mountain peaks
appeared like the scales of an enormous kirin. Amongst them, there
were nine peaks that were jointly referred to as the Fortunes Peaks.
Every single one of them had hundreds of estates floating around
them, all of which were surrounded by clouds. The dense clouds were
more than thirty meters thick, forming into streets and traversed by
carriages and maidservants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position atop one particular cloudbank, eating delicacies with
Uncle White and Little Qing by his side, along with a maidservant who
was awaiting his instructions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple in the air
above the mountain peak. Azurewillow and Princess Xiyue flew out
together, landing atop a cloud. Both sat down, and instantly,
maidservants came to deliver delicacies to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. That’s Ji
Ning, right over there.” Azurewillow gave Ning a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue followed
Azurewillow’s gaze, quickly discovering that in that direction,
there were quite a few clouds at various different levels, upon which
were seated various guests. In fact, some of them were extremely
respected, high-status members of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and they
voluntarily smiled towards Azurewillow and Princess Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Princess
Xiyue quickly discovered that amongst the guests, there was a very
ordinary-looking fur-clad youth. This youth was almost completely
absorbed in his eating, and by his side was a snowy white hound and
an azure serpent, both of whom were eating as well while chatting
about how ‘this one tastes great’ or ‘the imperial capital
lives up to its reputation’ or ‘I never tasted this in Stillwater
Commandery’ or ‘we certainly came to the right place, master!’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Princess
Xiyue looked towards the distant Ning, a warm feeling in her heart.
“They look so similar. He looks just like father!” Princess Xiyue
murmured quietly to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s appearance was
more like that of his mother, Yuchi Snow. Yuchi Snow and Yuchi Mount,
in turn, were actual siblings…as the saying goes, a boy will look
more like his maternal uncles. Ning did indeed have many facial
similarities to his uncle, Yuchi Mount. However, because Ning broke
through to the Xiantian level quite early on, he had always looked
just as he had when he was a youth. If he had made his breakthrough a
few years later…given how tall he already was at age eleven, by age
sixteen, he would’ve been quite massive and muscular.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
Princess Xiyue felt warmth in her heart, and her eyes couldn’t help
but begin to glisten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been far too
long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had always been by
herself. Even after her grandfather had found her and brought her
back to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, she was still very
lonely. She dearly missed her her departed mother, and her father,
who would never return…every night, in her dreams, she would return
to the warm, happy days she had spent with her parents on that
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She wanted to return to
that island, to go back to the life of a fisherman’s daughter.
Unfortunately…there was no way to ever go back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her father’s
life-tablet had already shattered. She had thought that she would
never have any other family members…but Youngflame Nong’s death
was discovered to have involved a youth, a youth whose mother was
named Yuchi Snow, a youth who was supposedly a ‘spawn of the Yuchi
clan’. Yuchi Snow…although she had never met this woman, she had
heard her father speak of her. That was the one and only surviving
little sister of her father’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
Princess Xiyue had been quite frantic earlier, but upon seeing that
youth, seated atop the clouds, be eating and chatting with his two
spirit-beasts, the Whitewater Hound and the Azure Skysnake, she no
longer felt frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue. Tonight is
the night of the monthly Treasure Auction,” Fairy Azurewillow said
with a laugh. “And I heard some news regarding this Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Princess Xiyue, upon hearing the words ‘Ji Ning’, instantly felt
curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurewillow said, “Ji
Ning originally wasn’t very interested in the Treasure Auction, but
upon hearing that the forces of the Youngflame clan would also be
present, he came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Princess
Xiyue was amazed. “What’s he going to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning came without
changing his appearance. He also brought his spirit-beasts and rode
on the carriage Youngflame Nong had owned, straight into the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain. It’s as though he was afraid the Youngflame
clan wouldn’t realize he was here.” Azurewillow sighed, “In
fact, upon hearing that the Youngflame clan would attend, he insisted
on attending as well. I feel as though he is setting himself directly
against the Youngflame clan. I must say, he truly is quite
audacious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t he in great
danger?” Princess Xiyue said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning has
acquired the treasures of the Youngflame clan; he definitely must
have quite a few protective treasures,” Azurewillow said. “And…for
him to be capable of killing Youngflame Nong means that he is an
extraordinary figure. Given his power, it will actually be quite hard
for the Youngflame to kill him in the imperial capital.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue quickly
returned to a clear-minded state. She nodded. “Right. The Imperial
Guard maintain a constant watch over the entire imperial capital.
Once battle begins, they’ll quickly teleport over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. So, if the
Youngflame clan wishes to kill Ji Ning, they’ll probably have to
send Deathsworn, and a Deathsworn capable of killing him in a single
breath at that. Finding this sort of Deathsworn…” Azurewillow
shook her head. “Hard. Very hard. He’d have to be a supreme Loose
Immortal at the very least, but most likely, even a supreme Loose
Immortal wouldn’t necessarily be able to kill him within a single
breath. After all, Ji Ning has already displayed prowess in battle
sufficient to kill Youngflame Nong and a Primal-level Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue laughed
as well. She suddenly felt a sense of pride for this cousin of her’s;
her cousin truly was formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already late at
night. Stars had appeared in the night sky. The starlight linked
together, creating rays of starlight. A tall, thin, narrow-eyed old
man was taking a stroll through the skies, surrounded by starlight.
It was Patriarch Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath him was a
quiet, secluded mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Floatcloud.”
Patriarch Arcanum spoke out, and his voice instantly echoed out,
passing through the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a figure emerged
from within the mountains. It was a bald old man. Upon seeing
Patriarch Arcanum, the bald old man immediately bowed with respect.
“Floatcloud pays his respects to the Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm. How many years
have you trained for?” Patriarch Arcanum asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has already been
128,113 years,” the bald elder said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad. Every
hundred thousand years constitutes a major accomplishment; many Loose
Immortals are unable to make it past a hundred thousand years,”
Patriarch Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald elder said
hurriedly, “When I faced the tribulation that year, my Primal base
was damaged. It was all thanks to the help of the tribe that I was
able to restore my base quickly, which allowed me to survive until
now. However…I’m almost at my limit. Each trial and tribulation
poses a major threat to me. I want to reincarnate, but I’m afraid
that I will fail in doing so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reincarnation wouldn’t
necessarily be successful; if one was lucky, one might succeed, but
there were also those who would fail. The Netherworld Kingdom, after
all, was not a kind, gentle place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can bestow a
dharmic decree of reincarnation unto you,” Patriarch Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A dharmic decree of
reincarnation?” The bald elder instantly revealed a look of
surprise and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dharmic decrees were
decrees which were issued by major powers of the Three Realms. Even
the Netherwold Kingdom would give face to the dharmic decrees of
major powers. Even for the Youngflame clan, such decrees were
extremely precious. After all, there were far too many Loose
Immortals; the entire Youngflame clan had in excess of a thousand
Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need you to
accomplish something,” Patriarch Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please instruct me,
Patriarch,” the bald elder said hurriedly. He had begged the clan
repeatedly in the past, but the clan had not given him a dharmic
decree of reincarnation. Now that the Patriarch had come in person
and said that he would bestow a dharmic decree of reincarnation…this
must involve a major affair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know that Ji
Ning killed my child, Nong?” Patriarch Arcanum said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do,” the bald
elder said hurriedly. How could he not know? Youngflame Nong had been
all but guaranteed to be the next Godplume Duke, and had a Fiendgod
bodyguard. In the Patriarch’s heart, his status had been far higher
than that of Loose Immortal whose life was nearing its end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ji Ning is
currently in the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.” Patriarch
Arcanum instructed, “You are to go there and kill Ji Ning, then go
reincarnate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial
capital?” The bald elder’s face changed. Kill someone in the
imperial capital? Kill Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no simple
task. After all, Ji Ning was someone who had even managed to kill
both Youngflame Nong and a Primal-level Fiendgod. Killing Ji Ning was
very difficult, and to kill someone in the imperial capital was
incredibly troublesome. If he wasn’t, even his soul would be
captured and taken away by the Imperial Guard. Most likely, the end
result would be that his soul would be shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you time
to prepare. Buy or trade for whatever treasures you need. However, I
want you to kill Ji Ning within three days,” Patriarch Arcanum said
coldly. At the same time, he produced a golden scroll in his hand.
“This is the dharmic decree of reincarnation. If you swear an oath
to the Dao of the Heavens, I’ll give it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald elder
hesitated, looking at the golden dharmic decree. He thought about the
fact that he had quite a few treasures; he could sell them off and
purchase a few particularly powerful items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And…since Patriarch
Arcanum had personally come, most likely, he had no choice but to
accept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the Dao of the
Heavens bear witness! I, Floatcloud, shall kill Ji Ning within three
days, and will not reveal any information regarding the Youngflame
clan. If I violate this oath, let my soul be shattered.” The bald
elder gritted his teeth, then swore the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very good.”
Patriarch Arcanum nodded, then casually waved his hand, sending the
golden scroll flying forward. The bald elder immediately caught it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you
three days…but the sooner the better.” After saying his part,
Patriarch Arcanum took a single step, then disappeared within the
countless stars of the night sky.

Chapter 14 - First Encounter With Woodpass
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. The clouds hovering around the nine peaks of the Fortunes
Peaks. Atop the clouds were formidable figures from various areas
around the world; this truly was a place where the fish swam with the
dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” A violet-robed Yu Qi had just arrived at Ning’s place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning gave him
a glance. Earlier, he had sold off treasures worth 1.3 million
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence to this man. Ning was quite
satisfied with this. Smiling, he said, “Fellow Daoist Yu Qi, come,
have a few cups of wine with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need,” Yu Qi
said with a laugh, then whispered, “I’ve come to inform you,
fellow Daoist Ji Ning, that the men of the Youngflame clan have
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The men of the
Youngflame clan have arrived?” Ning’s eyes lit up. “Where?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right? Where?”
Little Qing’s eyes were shining as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi was
flabbergasted. When these two had heard the word ‘Youngflame clan’,
it was as though they had located their prey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right over there.”
Yu Qi gestured with his eyes as he gave a sideways glance to a
distant mountain peak. “See them? That group that just flew out
from that mountain peak. Including the maid, there are nine in
total.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
followed Yu Qi’s gave. Right away, he saw the group of people
flying out; the group was led by a middle-aged man with an
extraordinary aura and loose, unbound long hair. By his side were two
youths. As for the others with him, they were all guards, servants,
and maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Xiushui?”
Ning’s eyes narrowed. After having sold off the magic treasures,
Ning had purchased quite a few intelligence reports, such as a
detailed one regarding the Youngflame clan and the various other
powers of the imperial capital. In short, Ning had already memorized
all of the fairly formidable figures of the Youngflame clan that had
been mentioned in the intelligence reports.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui was
a Void-level Earth Immortal! He was being nurtured by the Youngflame
clan, and had a good chance of becoming a Celestial Immortal. In
fact, his position was such that he couldn’t even be bothered to
become a Godplume Duke. This was because, for one who had a true
chance of becoming a Celestial Immortal, there was generally no time
to take care of various clan matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming the Godplume
Duke meant that one would have to carry out many matters and divide
one’s attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You recognize him?”
Yu Qi laughed softly. “This is Youngflame Xiushui with his son,
Youngflame Jun. They’ve invited Adept Woodpass of the Southern Seas
to be their guest for dinner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve invited
Adept Woodpass?” Ning said, puzzled, “Youngflame Xiushui has an
extraordinary status; he’s actually inviting a Wanxiang Adept to
dinner, and one from the Southern Seas?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi laughed. “Fellow
Daoist Ji Ning, you don’t understand; the Southern Seas are
incomparably vast and difficult to govern. Thus, the battles between
the cultivators in that area are extremely chaotic and ferocious.
However, this chaotic region has given birth to some truly
outstanding geniuses. Adept Woodpass can be described as one of the
most supreme of Wanxiang Adepts of this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most supreme?”
Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Southern Seas…that
was a place of endless water, with many islands and cultivators, that
was comparable in size to several commanderies. To describe someone
was being one of the most supreme of Wanxiang Adepts in this place
was quite the boast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass is
one of those who have come to the Conclave of Immortal Destiny in
order to fight for first place,” Yu Qi said softly. “Three
hundred years ago, Adept Woodpass was already capable of executing a
Primal Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed a Primal
Daoist more than three centuries ago?” Ning was greatly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Woodpass…for
the sake of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, he managed to force
himself to remain at the Wanxiang Adept level for three centuries?”
The nearby Little Qing called out in shock, “I’ve heard of freaks
like him, but I didn’t expect to actually run into one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, every
single cloud was surrounded by formations which blocked out sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still felt his
heart clench. He had killed Primal Daoists three hundred years ago?
Then how powerful must he now be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass is
extremely famous,” Yu Qi said hurriedly. “Two hundred years ago,
he produced his Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwin…”
Ning silently memorized this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few decades ago,
his Primaltwin actually trained all the way to the Void level,
becoming an Earth Immortal!” Yu Qi said. “He took over an island
in the Southern Seas and often expounds on the Dao there, turning
away neither monsters nor humans. He often expounds on the Dao,
causing his fame to grow greater and greater…and, according to what
the outside world knows, more than six Loose Immortals have died to
him already!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Uncle White,
and Little Qing were completely stunned upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a madman! His
true body is only at the Wanxiang Adept level, but his Primaltwin
actually dared to train to the Void level and become an Earth
Immortal?” Little Qing called out in shock. “Three hundred
years…isn’t he afraid of the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To dare to act in
such an insane manner…either he’s a madman, or he’s an
absolute, peerless monster,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was actually
incredibly dangerous for a Primaltwin to train to the Void level and
become an Earth Immortal when the true body was a Wanxiang Adept.
This was because once a Calamity or a Tribulation descended, the
power of the trial would be linked to one’s own power. How
terrifying would a Calamity or a Tribulation meant for an Earth
Immortal be? The terrifying trial would simultaneously descend on
both the true body and the Primaltwin. The Primaltwin might make it,
but if the original body was too weak, it might not be able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primaltwin of
Adept Woodpass broke through to the Earth Immortal level a few
decades ago; it’s possible that he had already overcome his
Calamity at that time,” Yu Qi said with a laugh. “I refuse to
believe that his true Wanxiang-level body is capable of overcoming a
trial meant for a Void-level Earth Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. That made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, Adept
Woodpass truly is at a high level of comprehension. He dares to
publicly expound on the Dao, and the outside world knows of at least
six Loose Immortals who died to him…in the imperial capital, he is
publicly acknowledged as one of the contenders for the number one
position.” Yu Qi sighed, “He’s already so formidable; if his
true body becomes apprenticed to one of the major powers of the Three
Realms and learns even higher level techniques and divine abilities,
it will definitely become far more powerful than even his
Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Yu
Qi,” Ning said hurriedly, “Regarding this Conclave of Immortal
Destiny…there should be intelligence reports regarding some
publicly acknowledged formidable figures, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yu Qi
nodded. “However, just some of the more famous ones; after all, the
Grand Xia Empire is simply too vast. No one knows about all of the
monstrous geniuses that are hidden within it. For example, yourself,
fellow Daoist Ji Ning. Before you killed Youngflame Nong, no one in
the imperial capital had ever even heard of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia Empire
is a place of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Adept Woodpass is
just one of the most likely contenders, but no one knows if an even
more terrifying genius might emerge.” Yu Qi sighed with great
emotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well. “I
need the intelligence reports regarding this Conclave of Immortal
Destiny and some formidable Wanxiang Adepts participating in it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll deliver it
shortly,” Yu Qi said with a laugh, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still seated atop the
cloud, Ji Ning, Uncle White, and Little Qing all felt as though this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny wouldn’t be an easy one to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even his Primaltwin
is a Void-level Earth Immortal…and yet he insists on shamelessly
keeping his true body at the ‘Wanxiang’ level,” Little Qing
grumbled viciously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, he wants to be
apprenticed to a truly formidable figure of the Three Realms,” Ning
said with a laugh. “It makes sense.” As the saying went, a
teacher could lead you through the door, but training relied on one’s
self.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although training did
indeed rely on one’s self, one still needed a teacher to at least
lead one through the door. If one had a good teacher, the situation
would be completely different. Although Ning had never met Daoist
Threelives, given that Daoist Threelives had arranged the ‘Divine
Abilities Hall’, ‘Wargod Hall’, and ‘Stellar Hall’ for him,
it was as though Daoist Threelives was personally guiding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In another area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since our last
parting in the Southern Seas, it has been more than a century. Now,
fellow Daoist, you have come to the imperial capital, hahaha…”
The long-haired Youngflame Xiushui laughed with emotion. “When I
think about how how you will display your divine might in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, and about how some of the major powers
of the Three Realms will discover you and perhaps accept you as
disciple…I can’t help but feel jealous of you. I feel as though I
should’ve stayed a few more years at the Wanxiang level as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass looked
like a youth; he had a simple, honest appearance. But this simple,
honest-looking youth was known throughout the Southern Seas. He had
travelled alone, establishing a tremendous reputation, and openly
gave lectures on the Dao. He was venerated by countless Immortal
cultivators and Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Xiushui, you don’t understand; to stay at the Wanxiang Adept level
is incredibly miserable,” Adept Woodpass said with a sigh. “My
true body’s foundation is far more powerful than that of my
Primaltwin’s; after all, my Primaltwin is only a Ki Refiner, while
my true body is primarily a Fiendgod Body Refiner. And yet, I keep on
refraining from breaking through. After having done so for so
long…it’s actually cast a shadow over my heart. In the recent
Calamity, when my Primaltwin was at the peak Primal level, the mental
attacks were exceptionally powerful. I almost died due to the
blandishments of the mental attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui
nodded. “Others only see your gloriousness and see you shine with
power at the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, but they don’t see how
you’ve gritted your teeth and endured the passage of the past three
centuries. The shadow cast over your heart by three centuries of
forcibly repressing your power…how terrifying it must be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” A
handsome youth next to them suddenly called out. Youngflame Xiushui
looked towards his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I wait for
three cenutires as well?” The handsome youth asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You? Even if you
wait three centuries, you have no hope. Focus on your training. If
you are able to become a Void-level Earth Immortal, I’d have to
thank the heavens and thank the earth.” Youngflame Xiushui shook
his head in resignation. His son, at his level of ability, wanted to
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny? In the past, even
Xiushui himself had chosen to give up. There were countless monsters
who had been suppressing their own power for years, waiting for this
chance to soar to the heavens during the Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
pursed his lips. Although he too had participated in the conversation
between his father and Adept Woodpass, he was clearly on a lower
level…and so, bored, he looked around. Suddenly, his gaze fell upon
a distant cloud. Atop the cloud there was a fur-clad youth, a snowy
white dog, and an azure-robed maiden. The fur-clad youth was actually
holding a book and reading it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he…?” The
handsome youth stared, wide-eyed. “…Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Father,
quick, look.” The handsome youth immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui
frowned as he looked at his son. His son had interrupted him while he
was speaking; clearly, he was rather displeased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look. Ji
Ning. That’s Ji Ning, who killed Youngflame Nong.” The handsome
youth pointed towards Ning’s direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui and
Adept Woodpass both looked in that direction. They immediately saw
the distant, fur-clad youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His appearance, his
clothes…and he has a Whitewater Hound and an azure-robed maiden by
his side. Can that really be Ji Ning?” Youngflame Xiushui frowned.
The Youngflame clan had been pursing Ji Ning this entire
time…however, they wouldn’t bother Youngflame Xiushui over a
matter like this. Still, in his heart, he felt proud of his clan, and
naturally wouldn’t permit outsiders to challenge it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can that really be
him?” Youngflame Xiushui said softly, “He dares to come to the
imperial capital…what is Ji Ning planning? To challenge my
Youngflame clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass looked
over as well, then laughed. “I heard that Ji Ning is quite
formidable. Can it be that he, too, has come to participate in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny?”

Chapter 15 - Desiring Fame at the Treasure Auction
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” Youngflame
Xiushui shook his head. “He’s only trained for thirty short
years. To try to shock everyone at the Conclave of Immortal Destiny
before he’s truly established his foundation of power? He’d just
be dreaming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him, his son
said while grinding his teeth, “Father, Ji Ning rose to fame by
stepping on our Youngflame clan. For the sake of our clan’s
reputation alone, we should kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s none of
your concern.” Youngflame Xiushui glanced at his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Youngflame Xiushui,
Adept Woodpass, Princess Xiyue, and Fairy Azurewillow were all paying
attention to Ning, the number of guests at the Fortune Peaks had
continued to steadily grow. These guests had all come here to
participate in the Treasure Auction. Amongst them, there was a bald
elder. He walked by himself to a cloud, then sat down in the lotus
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The bald
elder gave Ning, seated on a distant cloud around a different
mountain, a sidelong glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I kill Ji Ning,
I’ll then reincarnate. If I can’t kill him, then my soul will be
shattered.” The bald elder was Immortal Floatcloud, who had been
given the mission by Patriarch Arcanum. Although he had been away
from the imperial capital for more than ten thousand years, and very
few people in the capital were even capable of recognizing him,
Immortal Floatcloud had still changed his appearances and pulled in
his aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
stood there. Although he was drinking wine quite casually, he had
chosen the perfect spot; from the corner of his eyes, he could pay
clear attention to Ning’s actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The main
headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. There are layers of
protective spells here, and many Immortals on guard. To kill Ji Ning
within the Heavenly Treasures Mountain…unlikely!” Immortal
Floatcloud pondered on what to do. Actually, he wanted to walk right
over to Ning, quickly kill him, then immediately self-detonate and go
reincarnate. But he knew quite well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he attacked,
in the blink of an eye the formations of the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain would activate. There was almost no chance he would be able
to kill Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wait until he
leaves the Heavenly Treasures Mountain headquarters. Once he goes
out, on the outside streets…” Immortal Floatcloud continued to
ponder. “There will be no restrictive formations there. I can make
my move then! As for the Imperial Guards, although they will arrive
very quickly, it’ll still take them a bit of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let you live
a little while longer.” Immortal Floatcloud’s Dao-heart was
currently filled with the utmost resolve. There were no contradictory
thoughts in his mind at all. He had only one thought - to kill Ji
Ning, then reincarnate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was carefully
reading through the intelligence report which Yu Qi had brought. This
report detailed all of the more famous Wanxiang Adepts of the entire
imperial capital. Indeed, there were several individuals who were
publicly acclaimed as having the highest chances of success in this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. There was Xiamang Zishan of the
imperial clan, Cangwu Jiu of the Cangwu clan, Xiangtian Xiao of the
Xiangtian clan, Youngflame Xuan of the Youngflame clan, Adept
Woodpass of the Southern Seas, Adept Redbamboo of the Eastern Seas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These individuals all
had enormous reputations, and were publicly acclaimed as the most
supreme of Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the likes of
the Sloppy Daoist of the Black-White College were also recorded
within the book, they were clearly ranked towards the lower end. The
Sloppy Daoist could only be considered one of the supreme Wanxiang
Adepts of Stillwater Commandery. Adept Woodpass, Cangwu Jiu, and the
others listed in the front, however, were the most supreme of this
entire major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m actually in
this as well?” Ning flipped through, then laughed. “My main
battle accomplishment is actually the killing of Youngflame Nong and
a Primal-level Fiendgod.” If he hadn’t killed Youngflame Nong and
his servant, given how short Ning’s period of training had been, he
logically wouldn’t have emerged in this intelligence report at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the
maidservant who had been standing behind him moved forward. Ning
turned to look at her. She smiled and said, “Adept, the Treasure
Auction is about to begin. Are you going to participate? If you are,
please hand over five thousand kilograms as your deposit; if you are
not, then you will have to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Participating in the
Treasure Auction requires a deposit?” Ning said, surprised, “And
five thousand kilograms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
requirement of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain headquarters,” the
maidservant explained. “Ordinary Treasure Auctions don’t require
deposits, but the monthly Treasure Auction held by the headquarters
is an auction with treasures collected from throughout the Grand Xia
Empire, and even some other major worlds. Generally speaking, there
will be extremely valuable treasures present that are extremely rare
and precious. To prevent customers from making random bids they
cannot or will not honor, there is a need to put in a deposit of five
thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. If someone makes a
bid but doesn’t honor it, then we will punish them by taking away
the five thousand kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, the five
thousand kilograms is non-refundable,” the maidservant said.
“Adept, you can use it to buy whatever treasures you like during
the Treasure Auction. In the end, we will deduct the five thousand
kilograms from your total bill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems all
participants in the Treasure Auction, no matter what, must pay at
least five thousand kilograms…” Ning swept the area with his
gaze. “There are more than a thousand customers present. The amount
of liquefied elemental essence will be at a minimum of five million
kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have prepared
many treasures as well,” the maid said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded,
then tossed out an elemental talisman he had acquired earlier when
selling his treasures. The maid accepted it, then stepped backwards
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the Treasures
Peaks, the clouds were filled with maids chatting with their
customers. Some customers left, but quite a few remained. In fact,
there were some latecomers as well who had clearly arrived just for
the Treasure Auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame clan.”
Ji Ning stared towards the distant Youngflame Xiushui. “It seems
they’ve discovered me as well. Hmph. The reason I came to the
imperial capital was to make more people know about me. The more, the
better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
come so openly and in full ‘regalia’ was to become famous! The
Youngflame clan had been frantically searching for him and knew about
his whereabouts. However, the enemies of the Youngflame clan such as
the Kindwater clan, their most powerful enemy, probably didn’t know
about Ning’s arrival yet. So…what he wanted to do was to make
himself famous! To make all the customers at the Treasure Auction
spread word of his arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the major
powers of the Grand Xia’s imperial capital all know that I am
here…those who wish to befriend me will probably seek me out.”
Ning knew quite well that fighting against the Youngflame clan by
himself would be extremely taxing. He needed a bit of outside
support! Thus, he needed to become famous! It would be even better if
his name became spread throughout the imperial capital!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later. An
enormous, rainbow-colored cloud soared into the skies, with a
black-haired maiden standing atop it. Riding the cloud, she flew
directly towards the air in the center of the nine peaks of the
Fortune Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
black-haired maiden laughed, spinning around and curtseying in each
direction. “The time has come once more for the monthly Treasure
Auction. This Treasure Auction shall be administered by myself,
Feathervoid. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain has prepared, in total,
1360 treasures, each of which are extraordinary. They all have their
own unique attributes, and many of them come from hidden areas. Some
even come from dangerous areas that are elsewhere in the Three
Realms, or even beyond the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same as always;
aside from the treasures which our Heavenly Treasures Mountain is
selling off, all the customers present who possess treasures they
wish to auction off can do so, after an examination by us. The
Treasure Auction itself will only charge a commission of 5%, capped
off at five thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, enough with
the small talk. Let’s begin with the first item of this Treasure
Auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long black-haired
maiden waved her hand, and a golden set of drums suddenly appeared in
the air, wafting out with ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Battlesoul Drums,
Heaven-ranked magic treasure. It can be used to wound enemies, and it
can also be used to make thousands of your Dao-soldiers unleash
extraordinary combat power. Reserve price of five thousand kilograms!
Each bid has to be at least five hundred kilograms higher,” the
black-haired maiden said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“5500 kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“6000 kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formidable figures
who had come to attend the Treasure Auction all began to make their
bids, purchasing one treasure after another. Those who had the money
to put down 5000 kilogram deposits were all extraordinary
cultivators. Ordinary Primal Daoists wouldn’t be willing to spare a
deposit of such size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there,
drinking and watching leisurely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, aren’t you
going to act yet?” Little Qing felt her blood boil as she watched
the Treasure Auction go on. She was incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient,” Ning said. “The Youngflame clan hasn’t acted; why
should I be in a rush? And in addition, there aren’t any treasures
that I deeply desire either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures which
Ning had sold off were virtually all from either the Witchriver
Immortal Estate or from Youngflame Nong. As for the truly exquisite
items left behind by Immortal Juhua, Ning was holding them back and
in no rush to sell! After having been ‘baptized’ by going through
the treasures of Youngflame Nong, Immortal Witchriver, Immortal
Juhua, and the underwater estate, Ning now had very high standards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next treasure
is a formation diagram! This formation diagram belonged to the
Crab-Tortoise Immortal Duo. These two old Celestial Immortal
Diremonsters made them as part of a game. I imagine that you all know
that the Crab-Tortoise Immortal Duo had received a legacy from a
major power of the Three Realms, and are exceptionally skilled in the
Dao of Formations. Although this was nothing more than a toy to these
two Celestial Immortals, it is still quite extraordinary, and
contains many profound mysteries regarding formations. The
Crab-Tortoise Immortal Duo once said…anyone who completely
comprehends this formation diagram can be considered a grandmaster of
formations.” The black-haired maiden laughed, “This formation
diagram will start at a minimum price of 25,000 kilograms. Everyone,
place your bids.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Crab-Tortoise
Immortal Duo?” Everyone began to discuss this. As for Ning and
Uncle White, their eyes lit up as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
was completely focused on the Dao of Formations. Ning had a certain
degree of understanding regarding formations as well. Naturally, the
two knew of the Crab-Tortoise Immortal Duo. The Crab-Tortoise
Immortal Duo were two figures out of legends. Both were Celestial
Immortal Diremonsters…and they could be said to have the highest
level of comprehension regarding formations, here in the major world
of the Grand Xia Empire. In addition, it was said that they were
apprentices to a truly major power of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing more than a
toy to them…if this was the essence of their knowledge, then the
price would definitely not be a mere 25,000 kilograms.” Ning gave
the nearby Uncle White a glance; clearly, Uncle White was rather
eager and excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As someone who walked
the Dao of Formations, he was naturally filled with eagerness towards
this formation diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“25,500 kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“30,000 kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price of this
formation diagram quickly skyrocketed. Although the Dao of Formations
was an extremely complex and difficult one which very few truly
supreme geniuses would embark on, there were still some people who
knew that they had no hopes of becoming a Celestial Immortal and who
would thus focus their efforts on formations. Formation grandmasters
were quite terrifying, and in fact there were even some Celestial
Immortals who relied on formations as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the Dao of
Formations was a bitter, tough Dao to follow. A single formation
diagram wouldn’t rise to an excessive price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“40,000 kilograms.”
Youngflame Xiushui finally spoke out. This was already quite a high
price. Those who had come to the treasure auction were all quite
level-headed, and wouldn’t bid randomly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any higher bids?”
The black-haired maiden swept her gaze towards the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who had yet to
make a bid yet, suddenly spoke out. “42,500 kilograms!” He had
immediately raised the price by 2500 kilograms, and it had already
been at quite a high price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired maiden
glanced over, revealing a smile. “42,500 kilograms. Any higher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guests seated on
the clouds surrounding the various peaks all looked over, curious as
to who the bidder was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? A fur-clad
youth? A Whitewater Hound? An Azure Skysnake?” Ning, for the sake
of making himself more recognizable, had Little Qing revert to her
Azure Skysnake form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That fur-clad
youth…is he Ji Ning, who was said to have killed Youngflame Nong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong, the
next Godplume Duke of the imperial capital’s Youngflame clan, was
killed in Stillwater Commandery. Didn’t you hear about this? The
person who killed him was Ji Ning! The one who just made the bid!
Look at those two spirit-beasts next to him, and look at his
appearance. There’s no mistaking it. It’s him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed Youngflame
Nong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The previous bidder
was Youngflame Xiushui of the Youngflame clan. Ji Ning is in a
bidding war against Youngflame Xiushui!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many guests of the
Fortunes Peaks were all focused on Ning now, and instantly, a buzz of
conversation swept the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui’s
face became unsightly to look at. As for the nearby Youngflame Jun,
his face turned red with anger. He ground his teeth, and it seemed as
though his eyes were spitting fire. He called out loudly, “45,000
kilograms!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“45,000 kilograms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rage-filled voice
echoed through the entire Fortune Peaks, reverberating in the air.
This caused quite a few guests to look over. From that rage-filled
bid…they could tell that the Youngflame clan must have been truly
enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You imbecile.”
Atop the cloud. Youngflame Xiushui, upon hearing his son make the
bid, couldn’t help but give his son a hard look. He shouted
mentally at him, “Can’t you tell that Ji Ning wants to make a
name for himself today? He’s dared to come to the imperial capital
openly and without any disguises, and even came to the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain headquarter to participate in the Treasure Auction
and cause trouble for our Youngflame clan during the bidding. This is
all because he wants to make a name for himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In Stillwater
Commandery, even the Northmont clan would have to give our Youngflame
clan face. But this isn’t Stillwater Commandery; this is the
imperial capital. This isn’t a place where we can just do whatever
we please. What he wants to do is make a name for himself and make
everyone in the imperial capital know about him, Ji Ning! Later on,
he will enter an opposing power, which will make it much harder for
our Youngflame clan to act against him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui
looked at his son. “Earlier, we could’ve just ignored him, but
now that you are in a bidding war against him…more and more people
are going to know about him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but I’ve
already made a bid…how about, how about we stop bidding?”
Youngflame Jun was beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since we’ve made a
bid, we can’t lower our heads,” Youngflame Xiushui sent. “The
more people are watching, the more careful we need to be not to lose
face for our Youngflame clan. Don’t say anything else. Let me
handle it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Youngflame Jun didn’t dare to say anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, upon hearing a
bid of ’45,000 kilograms!’ be called out, immediately laughed.
This was as perfect as someone delivering a pillow to him, just as he
was feeling drowsy. He wanted to make his name known!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“45,000 kilograms.
Anything higher?” The black-haired maiden atop the cloud called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If someone else was
bidding, I’d just say forget about it. But, since it’s the
Youngflame clan that’s bidding, then I, Ji Ning, refuse to back
down. 47,500 kilograms!” Ji Ning’s voice rang out as well,
echoing within the nine peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it really is Ji
Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, who killed
Youngflame Nong, is at the Treasure Auction?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although earlier a few
guests had noticed Ning, they only made up a small part of the total
people present. Now that Ning spoke out so challengingly…more and
more people began to pay attention to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I KNEW he was trying
to make himself known.” Youngflame Xiushui’s face was like ice.
As for his son, Youngflame Jun, he didn’t dare to make a single
sound. He knew that his earlier bid had given Ning his opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little fellow from
Stillwater Commandery, you actually want to struggle against my
Youngflame clan?” Youngflame Xiushui said calmly, “50,000
kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, if your
Youngflame clan wants this formation diagram, then prepare a bit more
liquefied elemental essence. 60,000 kilograms!” Ning once more
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui’s
face sank. This was a formation diagram that was clearly only worth
forty to fifty thousand kilograms, but the price had been forcibly
uplifted. If he continued to bid, regardless of whether or not he
ended up acquiring the formation diagram, the Youngflame clan would
still have ‘lost’. This was because, even if they acquired
it…they would’ve paid an excessive price for it. But if they
didn’t acquire it? It would be akin to having let Ning trample all
over them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“62,500 kilograms,”
Youngflame Xiushui growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“64,000 kilograms.”
Ning didn’t increase the price too much this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Youngflame clan
has plenty of formation diagrams like this. I’ll let you have this
one.” Youngflame Xiushui felt as though something was wrong, and he
immediately stopped bidding. “You have no skill in formations, but
actually bid so much out of spite. How amusing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, what’s a
mere 64,000 kilograms? It’s nothing. Youngflame Nong, of your
Youngflame clan, gifted me with millions of kilograms!” Ning’s
laugh rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui’s
face immediately sank. Actually, he knew very well that as soon as
his son called out a bid of 45,000 kilograms, their side was going to
suffer a loss no matter what. This was because Ji Ning’s motivation
was to make a name for himself! No matter what, Ning would definitely
be able to achieve his goal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the price of 64,000
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, the formation diagram left
behind by the Crab-Tortoise Immortal Duo was purchased by Ji Ning.
And, in turn, Ji Ning attracted the attention of the vast majority of
the guests present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those final words in
particular, about how ‘Youngflame Nong, of your Youngflame clan,
gifted me with millions of kilograms’, was simply too vicious and
brutal. Virtually all of the guests present began to murmur amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Millions of
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Nong was
one of the Four Dukelings of the imperial capital; he had quite a few
magic treasures on him. Now, all of them were taken away by Ji Ning
at one go. I imagine he really does have several million kilograms
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m starting to
wish I was the one who killed Youngflame Nong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Millions of
kilograms. That’s enough to buy even an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, although
Youngflame Nong did indeed carry astonishingly valuable treasures on
him, of his three most precious treasures, he had already used up two
of them; the ‘Lock’ scroll and the black-and-white disc. The only
one remaining was the Greater Teleportation Dao-seal, which was
something that generally wasn’t even available on the market for
those who had enough money to purchase it. Ning wasn’t willing to
sell it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the many
guests. Princess Xiyue stared at Ning from afar, a hint of softness
in her eyes. This look was the look one had when one looked at a
kinsman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue, you are quite
well-disposed towards Ji Ning?” Fairy Azurewillow laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Princess
Xiyue nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Want to bring him on
as your groom?” Azurewillow teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t speak
nonsense.” Princess Xiyue frowned as she snapped back in a soft
voice. She viewed Ji Ning purely as a family member, as a little
brother. What was this nonsense about marrying him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to admit
though, this Ji Ning really is bold. He actually dares to go
completely head-on against the Youngflame clan.” Fairy Azurewillow
sighed. “He even said that Youngflame Nong gifted him with millions
of kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. I imagine that when the
Youngflame clan heard these words…I don’t even know how angry
they must be right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. One
treasure after another was auctioned off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly two hours later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
black-haired maiden’s voice suddenly went higher. “Don’t just
chat with your friends. This next treasure is the most valuable one
this particular Treasure Auction has put up so far. This is truly a
treasure which normally cannot be purchased. If you miss this chance,
who knows if you’ll ever have another one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many guests all
immediately turned to look at her, curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, curious, looked
over as well. The most valuable treasure thus far? The highest bid
for a treasure in this auction thus far had gone up to more than
150,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an
‘intrinsic magic treasure’, left behind by a peacock-type
Godbeast from the Heaven Realm after it died,” the black-haired
maiden called out loudly. “And this peacock-type Godbeast had an
incomparably pure lineage; even after it had reached the Void level,
it was still unable to transform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning,
hearing this, was shocked. Unable to transform even after becoming a
Void-level Earth Immortal? Could it be that it could only transform
after becoming a Celestial Immortal? A Godbeast like this…he hadn’t
even heard of such a creature in this world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This peacock-type
Diremonster’s ‘intrinsic magic treasure’ consisted of five
plumes.” The black-haired maiden waved her hand, and instantly,
five peacock feathers appeared out of nowhere. These five peacock
plumes hovered there, emanating a natural aura of might and power.
One was wreathed by fire, one was wreathed by water, the third seemed
to emanate an aura of infinite ponderance, the fourth howled with
golden energy, and the fifth emanated a blurry, azure aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the five plumes
appeared, the surrounding space seemed to be immediately frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a series of
cries rang out from throughout the Treasure Auction area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Peacocks were born from
the Five Elements, and even amongst such creatures, were the favored
children of the heavens. Supposedly, the more pure the lineage of a
peacock-type Godbeast was, the more dense and pure the Five Elements
essence would be in their plumes. Some were capable of manifesting
two plumes, others three. Only those with the most exquisite and pure
of Godbeast lineages would be capable of forming five plumes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A peacock Godbeast with
such a pure lineage was definitely no weaker than a Fiendgod. A
Void-level peacock Godbeast was most likely comparable to a Celestial
Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These five plumes it
had were innately bestowed with the five elements,” the
black-haired maiden said with a laugh. “Unfortunately, it was
merely a Void-level Diremonster. If it had been a Diremonster at the
Celestial Immortal level…the value of these five plumes would be
truly high. Most likely, even Celestial Immortals would go mad for
it. But of course, if this peacock Godbeast had become a Celestial
Immortal, this plume wouldn’t appear in a place like this. In fact,
there’s no way we would sell it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone nodded. These
five plumes were already incredibly precious; if the peacock had
undergone the heavenly tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal,
the value of its plumes would probably rise by thousands of times.
Most likely, even the emperors of the major worlds would feel desire
for it. However, a Celestial Immortal peacock Godbeast with such an
exalted, rare, and pure bloodline would probably be comparable to an
ordinary True Immortal. It wouldn’t easily perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it was
merely a Void-level Earth Immortal, given how exalted and noble its
lineage was, and how its five plumes were divided into the Five
Elements…if these plumes are used to forge a magic artifact, when a
few other things are mixed in, they can absolutely produce an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure. Normally, it would at least be a
high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure, but if you were lucky, you
might even be able to produce a top-grade Immortal-ranked magic
treasure,” the black-haired maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five plumes were
the ‘intrinsic magic treasures’ of the peacock-type Godbeast. To
humans, however, they could only be used for refining artifacts. As
for making them into a top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure? That
was just nonsense. Many other materials would be required, and the
chances of success were virtually negligible. However, there truly
was a very high chance of producing a high-grade Immortal-ranked
magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A reserve price of a
million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence! Each bid has to
increase by at least fifty thousand kilograms!” The black-haired
maiden called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1,050,000 kilograms.
I’m taking these Five Elements Peacock Plumes.” An ancient voice
rang out. The speaker was an old man dressed in a long, gaudy robe
that was covered with draconic runes. Anyone who looked at the
clothes would be able to tell right away that this should be someone
from the imperial clan of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Treasure
Auction, no one gave a damn if you were from the imperial clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is going
to forge an Immortal-ranked magic treasure of the Five Eleemnts. He’s
lacking in some primary materials. 1,100,000 kilograms.” A
white-whiskered youth said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1,150,000
kilograms.” Another man called out, his entire body covered with
azure light. He was built like a rod of iron.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1,200,000 kilograms.
I need a Five Elements Immortal-ranked magic treasure for my
tribulation.” The speaker was Youngflame Xiushui. By now, he paid
no attention to Ji Ning at all; he stared directly at the Five
Elements plumes. Clearly, he was determined to acquire it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1,250,000 kilograms.
The Raindragon Godpeak will take this.” A woman with a monstrous
aura that filled the skies spoke out in an icy voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single person had
an extraordinary background. However, the imperial capital of the
Grand Xia had its laws, and no one was able to take this thing by
force. Everyone had to rely on their own ‘abilities’; whoever had
more liquefied elemental essence would win! Materials like this, with
a perfect set of the Five Elements…they were indeed extremely rare.
You truly might only encounter them once; no one could say when such
items would appear again. You couldn’t simply purchase them, even
if you had enough liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people wanted to
acquire them. So, too, did Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally formed by
the Five Elements?” Ning’s eyes were shining. “I train the [Six
Cycles of the Starseizer]. I need the essence of the Five Elements.
These five plumes and the essence within them…based on the legacy
of the [Starseizing Hand] which I acquired and the materials
mentioned within them, these would definitely be considered
absolutely high-grade materials. These are five plumes that were born
from a peacock Godbeast with a supremely pure and exalted lineage.
The essence of the Five Elements within them…they’d probably be
enough to allow me to reach the third Cycle of my [Starseizing
Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1,300,000
kilograms!” Ning called out loudly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_17___Stopping_At_Nothing"></A>
Chapter 17 - Stopping At Nothing to Acquire It
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly, more
than a thousand of the other customers at the Fortune Peaks all
turned to stare. It must be understood that although they, too, were
participating in the Treasure Auction, in reality they would only
spend around fifty thousand kilograms or so in purchasing treasures.
Only very, very few were truly willing to pay more than five hundred
thousand kilograms! The entire networth of many Loose Immortals was
perhaps lower than this amount, and their networth was usually tied
up in their magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a small portion of
the people present at the Fortune Peaks were capable of making a bid
of 1.3 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that Ji Ning
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mere Wanxiang
Adept?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dares to purchase
the Five Elements peacock plumes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does he even have
that much liquefied elemental essence?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed Youngflame
Nong and a Primal-level Fiendgod. Youngflame Nong had quite a few
treasures on him, and that Fiendgod probably had quite a few as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of
conversations erupted. Everyone was stunned at the fact that Ning
dared to bid as well. After all, all five of the previous bidders had
extraordinary backgrounds, and all of them were Immortals! Ji Ning?
He was a mere Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.35 million
kilograms. Young fellow from the Black-White College, this is just
raw materials, not an actual magic treasure; even if you buy it, it
will be of no use to you. You have to match it with many other raw
materials and invite a forging expert to forge an Immortal-ranked
magic treasure for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.4 million
kilograms. Whoever bids the highest will gain the treasure. It
doesn’t matter that Ji Ning is just a Wanxiang Adept; even an
ordinary mortal who has enough money can bid. Don’t concern
yourself over why he’s buying it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.5 million
kilograms. Everyone, stop fighting with me over it. Master has needed
this sort of Five Elements raw materials for a very long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price slowly began
to rise. Ning, in turn, began to feel the pressure as well. After
all, he had only sold off around 1.3 million kilograms of treasure
earlier. Still, this was within his expectations; after all, the
peacock plumes could serve as the primary materials for a high-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasure. This wasn’t something which his
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp could compete with. It was, after all, just a
low-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, send the
price sky-high and stun then.” Suddenly, the giant yellow bear’s
voice rang out in his mind. “If they slowly bid it up, the final
price will probably be even higher. Make an immediate bid of 2
million kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated
slightly. He was carrying the underwater estate with him, and the
spirit of the estate was capable of sensing everything going on in
the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2 million
kilograms!” Ning called out in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the Fortune
Peaks fell completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, the bidding
increases had all been at slow increments of just fifty thousand
kilograms. This sudden increase of five hundred thousand kilograms
was simply too huge. After all, this wasn’t an actual
Immortal-ranked magic treasure; just materials for making one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has that much
liquefied elemental essence?” Princess Xiyue began to worry in her
heart. When she saw Ning make bids, she wanted to help him…but she
always stayed within the royal estate and rarely ventured out to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain. As a result, she almost never spent
money, and thus she only carried some protective treasures with her.
In addition, she was only a Wanxiang Adept herself; she naturally
wouldn’t have any Immortal-ranked magic treasures with her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t go out
adventuring, and she always stayed in the imperial capital; thus,
most likely the total value of the magic treasures she was carrying,
if sold off, would only come to perhaps five hundred thousand or a
million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2 or 2.5 million
kilograms…not even many imperial princesses were capable of
producing such a sum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If only Grandpa was
here,” Princess Xiyue mused silently to herself. Given how her
Grandpa coddled her in all things, if he was here, purchasing the
peacock plumes would only be a minor matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning…how
much treasure did he acquire from killing Youngflame Nong?” The
nearby Fairy Azurewillow sighed, completely moved. “He even dares
to bid on items like the peacock plumes. 2 million kilograms! That’s
enough to actually purchased a completed Immortal-ranked magic
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning only killed
mere Youngflame Nong; how much could Youngflame Nong have possibly
been worth? Ji Ning actually dares to bid two million kilograms?” A
white-faced, beardless youth frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two million
kilograms?” The man whose entire body glittered with a metallic
azure light frowned as well. This price was indeed rather high. To
produce a powerful Immortal-ranked magic treasure, other materials
were needed as well. In addition, a Celestial Immortal Patriarch who
was skilled in forging artifacts would have to personally oversee the
forging, which would not be cheap either. Only after all these
expenses would an Immortal-ranked magic treasure take form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow.”
Adept Woodpass, who had been watching this with intrigue, sighed in
amazement as well. He couldn’t help but cast the distant Ning a
deep, long glance. Two million kilograms? Ji Ning truly was quite
wealthy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went, a
horse who was not fed an extra ration of grass wouldn’t be fat and
sturdy; to focus on training and searching for natural treasures
truly wasn’t as efficient as Ning’s killing of Youngflame Nong.
By killing Youngflame Nong, he had instantly grown rich!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Xiushui, are you still planning to bid against him?” Adept Woodpass
laughed. “I still have roughly half a million kilograms that I can
led to you, fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, fellow
Daoist Woodpass.” Youngflame Xiushui glanced towards a nearby
attendant, and the azure-robed man immediately walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you say
earlier that based on your investigations, Ning’s trade with the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain was only worth around 1.3 million
kilograms?” Youngflame Xiushui said, frustrated and irritated, “If
he only had 1.3 million kilograms, how would he dare make a bid of
two million?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed servant
said hurriedly, “Master, this information is absolutely correct.
Don’t worry; the Heavenly Treasures Mountain headquarters also
knows that Ji Ning only traded for 1.3 million kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence with them. For him to suddenly bid two
million…they, too, will be worried that Ning is not going to be
honor his bid for this auction, and so will go investigate him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Youngflame
Xiushui nodded. His gaze suddenly lit up, as he already saw that atop
the distant cloud on which Ning was seated, a man and a woman were
flying towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had noticed two
figures were flying towards him from behind as well. One was an
azure-robed Yu Qi, while the white-robed one was a bald woman. As the
two flew towards the cloud, a mist suddenly arose from it, completely
blocking out the surrounding area, causing the outside world to have
no idea what they were discussing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald woman said
with a smile, “Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, I am Soledust of the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain. I know that you, fellow Daoist, had already
traded for 1.3 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, but
now that you are suddenly bidding 2 million…our Heavenly Treasures
Mountain is concerned that in the end, this transaction cannot be
completed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. In an
ordinary treasure auction, if the auction failed due to insufficient
funds from the winning bidder, it would be enough to just punish the
faithless bidder by taking away his deposit of 5000 kilograms. But
this was the auction for the peacock plumes; the value of it was
simply too great. If Ning were to make random bids that he could not
honor, there would be no way to make up for the damage done by just
penalizing him 5000 kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly hope you can
understand our position, fellow Daoist Ji Ning,” the bald,
white-robed woman said with great courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do understand,”
Ning laughed. “I’ve heard earlier that during this Treasure
Auction, if I have treasures of my own, I can hand them over to you
for auctioning, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The bald,
white-robed woman nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have one right
here.” Ning waved his hand, and an ancient, unassuming lamp
appeared. The lamp had azure flames blazing above it. Instantly, the
face of a child appeared within the azure flames. Scanning the
surrounding area, the child sighed, “You locked me in your storage
treasure for so long. That was really stifling. And whoah, what’s
this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Immortal-ranked
magic treasure?” The white-robed woman was startled. “Azuresilk
Godfire Lamp?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Azuresilk Godfire
Lamp was considered a fairly common type of Immortal-ranked magic
treasure. Described simply, it was just a type of lamp with Azuresilk
Godfire within it, but the Godfire within the lamp could be borrowed
to attack enemies. Although it was fairly common, quite a few experts
would still fight over the chance to acquire one. After all, everyone
wanted to help the skyfire in their bodies rise to the first grade if
at all possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, are you saying that you are intending to auction off this
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp? Here, at this Treasure Auction?” The
white-robed woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Heavenly
Treasures Mountain can just purchase it for a price of 1.5 million
kilograms,” the white-robed woman, Soledust couldn’t refrain from
saying. Although fairly common, it was extremely rare for an
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp to appear at auction, and whenever one
appeared, it would immediately be purchased. Naturally, the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain was willing to accept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, I’ll sell it
off in this Treasure Auction. Let’s set the reserve price at 1.5
million kilograms. If no one buys it, then I’ll sell it to you,”
Ning said. “Fellow Daoist Soledust, you wouldn’t object to this,
would you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed woman’s
facial muscles twitched. A reserve price of 1.5 million kilograms? To
be sold to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain only if no one was willing
to buy it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No objections, no
objections.” The white-robed woman picked up the Azuresilk Godfire
Lamp, then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t feel
worried; when the Heavenly Treasures Mountain headquarters engaged in
a business trade, they wouldn’t stop so low as to embezzling a
single low-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure like an Azuresilk
Godfire Lamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired maiden
standing on a cloud and officiating over this Treasure Auction was
waiting for the investigate by her side to conclude. Now that she
knew that Ning did indeed have the ability to complete this purchase,
she immediately said, “2 million kilograms. Are there any higher
bids?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this Ji
Ning does have the ability to honor his bid.” The pale-faced,
beardless youth shook his head and sighed. “Too expensive. The
price is too high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The price is too
high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">People immediately
began to give up. After all, Ning’s suddenly price increase of five
hundred thousand kilograms had truly stunned quite a few people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…there were
others who remained greatly desirous of these peacock plumes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.05 million
kilograms!” The man who shone with a metallic azure light said with
a growl, “This is something I need for my tribulation. I hope that
you will all give me, Eastclown, some face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, Eastclown, you
need to pass your tribulation, but so do I! 2.1 million kilograms,”
Youngflame Xiushui growled back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Eastclown was
just a solitary, wandering figure; although he was extremely
powerful, Youngflame Xiushui was still of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.15 million
kilograms!” Immortal Eastclown growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.2 million
kilograms!” Youngflame Xiushui ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.3 million
kilograms!” A killing intent appeared in Immortal Eastclown’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.35 million
kilograms!” Youngflame Xiushui’s gaze was like ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribulation. This
was the most difficult trial for any cultivator on an Immortal path.
By passing the Celestial Tribulation, one would be able to escape the
confines of the Three Realms, to live a carefree life, to live
forever! Upon failing…if one was lucky, one would end up as a mere
Loose Immortal. How could they not be willing to fight over a
treasure helpful for their tribulations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.5 million
kilograms!” Ning’s voice thundered out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui and
Immortal Eastclown simultaneously turned to stare. All of the guests
present turned to stare as well. They couldn’t help but begin to
chatter about Ji Ning once again. This was insane. 2.5 million
kilograms?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Xiushui,
do you have another bid?” Ji Ning stared at the distant Youngflame
Xiushui. If the desire those two Earth Immortals towards acquiring
the plumes could be described as ‘intense’, Ji Ning’s desire
would have to be described as no less than theirs! Finding treasures
with the essence extracts of the Five Elements…although it was a
bit easier for the second Cycle of the Starseizer, the third Cycle
was far more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peacock plumes,
however, were absolutely capable of allowing Ning to reach the second
and third Cycles, with some left over! Of the divine abilities Ning
trained in, the most powerful one was definitely the [Starseizing
Hand]; this was ranked as one of the top ten divine abilities that
had been created after the heavens had been established. It was
supreme within the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures,
curios…those were all secondary. The divine ability, [Starseizing
Hand], was what would make Ning’s power rise the most! The peacock
plumes…he absolutely had to have them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.5 million
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Any higher bids? Any
higher?” The black-haired maiden, atop her cloud, called out in a
high voice. The Fortune Peaks were filled with a buzz of
conversation, but not a single bid came out. Although Youngflame
Xiushui’s face was quite ugly to behold, even he hesitated. As for
Immortal Eastclown, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and accept
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there are no
higher bids, then this peacock plume will go to fellow Daoist Jij
Ning!” The black-haired maiden made one final urging call to the
crowd.
</P>

Chapter 18 - The Princess Wishes to See Me?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long pause,
during which the black-haired woman carefully looked at both Immortal
Eastclown and Youngflame Xiushui, the woman called out loudly, “Done!
2.5 million kilograms. The peacock plumes go to fellow Daoist Ji
Ning!” And with this declaration, the ownership of the peacock
plumes was settled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Xiushui let
out a single, long sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had been
hesitating and considering to bid again, but in the end, his reason
won out and held him back. The nearby Adept Woodpass gave him a
glance, then picked up his goblet of wine and took a sip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, why didn’t
you buy it?” Youngflame Jun couldn’t help but ask, “The peacock
plumes would be of great service to you during your tribulation…and
that Ji Ning was insisting on bidding straight against us. Whether
for the sake of giving vent to our anger or for your tribulation,
Father, you should’ve continued.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you know?
2.5 million kilograms? Do you even know how much that is?”
Youngflame Xiushui stared at his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Jun was
stunned. His status in the clan could not be compared to Youngflame
Nong’s; any amount of liquefied elemental essence above a million
kilograms was already a vast, astronomical sum to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With that much, I
could just go ahead and buy an excellent Immortal-ranked magic
treasure!” Youngflame Xiushui said, “There are many types of
Immortal-ranked magic treasures that can be used for the tribulation;
why should I completely focus my attentions on these peacock plumes?
Paying more than 2.5 million kilograms isn’t worth it. That’s a
sum of money that would have a major impact on my Immortal path; I
can’t possibly make random, stupid bids just because I’m angry
and want to give vent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Jun nodded
obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this Ji Ning is
an idiot as well.” Youngflame Xiushui turned to give him a cold
look. “Even though he has the peacock plumes, he’s just a
Wanxiang Adept. What’s the point of having them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we kill Ji Ning,
then the peacock plumes will be ours,” Youngflame Jun said, a hint
of desire in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And who would go do
the killing?” Youngflame Xiushui shook his head. “This isn’t
for something for you to concern yourself over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.5 million
kilograms.” Immortal Eastclown shook his head as well. “This
young Wanxiang Adept is really quite crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“2.5 million
kilograms. My little brother really is…formidable.” Princess
Xiyue stared at the distant Ning, a smile on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Acquiring the
peacock plumes won’t do a damn thing for your power. After you
leave the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, you die.” Immortal
Floatcloud quietly drink his wine, watching from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
extraordinarily excited. Success! He had acquired the peacock plumes!
Immortal-ranked magic treasures? Curios? Those were all less than a
dog’s fart in comparison. His Primaltwin only needed a large amount
of flying swords, while his main body, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner,
mainly needed divine abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this thing, I
won’t have to trouble myself at all regarding the completion of the
second and third Cycles for my [Starseizing Hand].” Ning was
absolutely delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because there were more
than a thousand magic treasures up for sale, the entire Treasure
Auction took up an entire day. Still, Ning left roughly six hours
later, because during the sixth hour of the Treasure Auction, the
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp came out for bidding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azuresilk Godfire Lamp,
an Immortal-ranked magic treasure. This was a completed treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It instantly aroused a
storm of bidding. The Azuresilk Godfire Lamp was different from the
peacock plumes; very few people needed those thing, but quite a few
had a use for the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp. This was because it could
nurture ‘skyfire’ to the first grade! Although each usage of the
lamp consumed a large amount of resources that took a long period of
time to replenish, after the replenishment, it could be used again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an item that
could be used over and over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, because the
Azuresilk Godfire Lamp needed time to absorb elemental energy from
the natural world and replenish its own energy, none of the major
tribes would ever be worried about having ‘too many’ of the lamps
on hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reserve price was
1.5 million kilograms, but the price quickly skyrocketed! It rose all
the way up to a price of 2.45 million kilograms before the bidding
came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal-ranked magic
treasures of this level were, in the end, still fairly common. Thus,
the price would settle down at a certain point. There was a limit to
how much it could rise during an auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He left?” Immortal
Floatcloud immediately noticed when Ning began to prepare to leave.
Frowning, he too began to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Immortal
Floatcloud arrived at the streets outside the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain headquarters. It was early morning now. The Golden Crow had
just risen into the skies, casting its light upon the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Immortal
Floatcloud’s emergence caused the members of the Youngflame clan
who were waiting outside to immediately move towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning should be
comoing out soon. Go inside the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and keep
an eye on him. Be ready to report as soon as he does.” Immortal
Floatcloud gave them order, then began to wait outside silently. He
was waiting for the final battle he would experience in his life! In
this battle, he would use all of the power available to him to kill a
supremely talented Wanxiang Adept within the imperial capital of the
Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s leaving?”
Princess Xiyue, upon seeing Ning prepare to leave, immediately rose
to her feet. A hint of panic was in her eyes. She could feel her
heartrate quickening, and she immediately said to the nearby Fairy
Azurewillow, “Azurewillow, help me make some arrangements. I want
to meet privately with Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Fairy
Azurewillow was startled, but then she nodded. “I’ll go make the
arrangements right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.”
Earlier, when Princess Xiyue had been watching Ji Ning, she hadn’t
felt that nervous. Now, however, as she thought about how they were
about to meet, she immediately became incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Princess
Xiyue let out a long sigh, then said quietly to herself, “Little
brother, we’re going to meet soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue began to
withdraw from the event as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, since the
Treasure Auction would go on for a full day, over the course of it,
quite a few people would withdraw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, after handing
over his liquefied elemental essence, acquired his formation diagram
and the peacock plumes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, in the future, if you have any more magic treasures you don’t
want, you can deliver them here to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
It doesn’t matter if you decide to sell them to us or if you sell
them at the Treasure Auction.” The white-robed woman, Soledust,
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures don’t
just fall out of nowhere from the sky,” Ning sighed. “I even had
to hand over my Azuresilk Godfire Lamp to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soledust laughed, then
withdrew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing glanced towards the nearby violet-robed Yu Qi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Yu Qi,
I wish to purchase some flying swords,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flying swords?” Yu
Qi was instantly delighted. He knew very well that Ning had more than
a million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence on him. This was a
major customer! He immediately said, “What sort of flying swords?
Just tell me what you need. We have plenty of precious flying swords
manufactured by Celestial Immortal Patriarchs, and in fact we even
have flying swords with powerful formations within them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
only require large-scale manufactured flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Large-scale
manufactured…” Yu Qi’s face stiffened. The profit on those was
incredibly low; after all, Ning could buy them at a 40% discount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need a total of
720 high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi’s facial
muscles spasmed. Good heavens; Heaven-ranked flying swords? 720 of
them? Was this a joke? It must be understood that even many Loose
Immortals would generally use Heaven-ranked magic treasures; many of
them would just use several particularly powerful ones. Even those
who focused on victory through superior numbers would at most have a
few dozen Heaven-ranked magic treasures, which was already quite
incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">720 Heaven-ranked magic
treasures? The number alone would terrify quite a few people! But in
turn, the price was quite high as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, are you certain you want 720? Are you able to afford them?”
Yu Qi couldn’t help but add, “High-grade Heaven-ranked magic
treasures are generally around 5000 kilograms per sword. If you want
more than 700 of them, then you’d need to pay over 3.5 million
kilograms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. Ugh!
Earlier, he had felt that he was quite wealthy, but when he thought
about the price of seven hundred Heaven-ranked magic treasures, he
suddenly felt his heart ache with unbearable pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and give me
a book on the types of mass-produced Heaven-ranked flying swords,”
Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. This way,
please,” Yu Qi said hurriedly. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain both
bought and sold mass-produced magic items to Ji Ning at a price of
60% the list price. On the surface, it would seem as though they
didn’t earn any money at all. In reality, however, the
mass-produced magic treasures which the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
sold were all mass-produced by the mighty imperial clan of the Grand
Xia, which stood behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the cost for
the imperial clan to mass-produce these magic items wasn’t really
as high as 60% of the list price; at most, 30% to 40%. The reason
they told the outside world that they were willing to both buy and
sell these items at 60% was just to encourage more people to come
shopping. After all, after an Immortal cultivator purchased a
life-saving treasure, it was quite rare for them to later sell it
off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Yu Qi would earn
quite a bit from this deal for 700+ Heaven-ranked flying swords, even
if they were only mass-produced artifacts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated before
a gazebo, staring at the rising sun and in quite a good mood. He had
no idea that right now, on the streets outside, a Loose Immortal
named Immortal Floatcloud was waiting for him impatiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here’s the report
regarding the mass-produced Heaven-ranked flying swords.” Yu Qi
handed Ning a thick, fur-clad book. Ning flipped it open, taking a
look. By his side, the Whitewater Houna and Little Qing helped scan
thorugh it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mass-produced flying
swords were rather cheap, because mass-produced flying swords mainly
required only that the swords were sharp and hard to break. In other
aspects, they were quite poor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Low-grade
Heaven-ranked flying swords are 500 kilograms each? At a discounted
price of 60%, that’s just 300 kilograms.” Ning mumbled to himself
while reading. “Middle-grade is a bit more expensive; 1500
kilograms each.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were nearly a
hundred types of low-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were nearly two
hundred types of middle-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were far fewer
high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords; just eighteen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for top-grade Heaven
ranked flying swords? There was no such thing as a mass-produced
‘top-grade’ flying sword. High grade was already the limit for
Heaven-ranked mass-produced flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“High-grade,
Heaven-ranked flying swords are all roughly 5000 kilograms each.”
Ning frowned. “What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to
purchase them for his Primaltwin to train in. The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] was a technique where the more and the better
flying swords he had, the more powerful it would be! However,
controlling so many flying swords was incredibly taxing on the soul.
Still, during his year of training in the underwater estate, Ning’s
soul had improved dramatically, especially with the support of the
Nuwa visualization technique and the fact that his Primaltwin’s
soul was being nourished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently able
to control all 720 Earth-ranked flying swords. But if they were to be
changed into Heaven-ranked flying swords? Most likely, for at least a
period of time, it would be hard for him to control that many.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll take 198 of
these Redsol swords!” Ning pointed towards the book. “And these
Netherblue swords, I’ll take 198 of them as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Redsol swords
were 5500 kilograms each, while the Netherblue swords are 3500 each,”
the nearby Yu Qi said with a laugh. “All together, this comes out
to be a price of 1,945,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.
At the discounted price of 60%, that comes out to be 1,185,300
million.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt resigned.
After factoring in the money he had spent…the 2.3 million kilograms
he had remaining had been almost completely used up, leaving just a
bit behind. In addition, his Primaltwin actually needed elemental
essence as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here!” Ning waved
his hand, and instantly, the black dragon carriage appeared on the
ground next to them. “I’ll sell this carriage to your Heavenly
Treasures Mountain,” Ning said majestically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black dragon
construct had the combat power of a Primal Daoist. Youngflame Nong
had often ridden it about the various locations of the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia; naturally, its price was extraordinary. In
the end, Ning acquired not only his 396 Heaven-ranked flying swords,
but also 60,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, there’s one more thing.” Yu Qi, after concluding their
deal, suddenly winked and laughed, “Princess Xiyue wishes to meet
with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A princess wants to
see me?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 19 - Peak Primal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, it must be
because you made a name for yourself during the Treasure Auction?”
The nearby Little Qing immediately added, “That’s why this
Princess Xiyue wants to meet you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grinned as well.
During the Treasure Auction, he had purchased the peacock plumes for
2.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. Even Youngflame
Xiushui had lowered his head and retreated in the end. This news
would definitely spread like wildfire, and later on, some of the
major clans would come to befriend him and meet him. This was within
his realm of expectations. However, for Princess Xiyue to invite him
for a meeting while the Treasure Auction was still going on…his
‘fame’ was perhaps just a bit too effective!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask who
Princess Xiyue is?” Ning asked..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess Xiyue is
from King Yan’s Estate,” Yu Qi explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan?” Ning’s
eyes lit up. Ning had already purchased intelligence reports
regarding some of the major powers and figures within the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia. King Yan was one of those major figures.
King Yan…was a Celestial Immortal who had just recently succeeded
in overcoming his tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Celestial
Immortal! It was simply far, far too difficult to become a Celestial
Immortal. Just by looking at the history of the Black-White College,
one could tell how hard it was. The Black-White College had existed
for countless millions of years, and every ten thousand years or so
would produce an Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal. How many had they
produced over the countless ages? And yet, they had only produced a
single Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
tell what a terrifying barrier the Celestial Tribulation was.
Countless geniuses, such as Immortal Northwalker or even Immortal
Juhua, who had the benefit of the underwater estate, had failed and
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
were simply too rare! It was rare for the Grand Xia Empire to produce
a single Celestial Immortal in a million years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, how many Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals did it produce during a million years?
This was why there were actually very many Loose Immortals and Earth
Immortals; the Youngflame clan alone held more than a thousand of
them. Every few tens or hundreds of millennia, there would be a new
‘batch’ of Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals…but the number of
Celestial Immortals who had arisen from them over the course of
countless years was pitifully low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any Celestial Immortal
was the foundation of his or her entire clan! Even for the mighty
imperial Xiamang clan of the Grand Xia Dynasty, a Celestial Immortal
was extremely valuable. For clans like the imperial Xiamang clan,
which had unified an entire major world, the number of Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals under their control was an absolutely
terrifying figure. Naturally, however, these figures had very
ordinary statuses. If, however, one of them were to break through and
become a Celestial Immortal…the imperial clan of the Grand Xia
would immediately bestow upon them the royal title of ‘King’ and
give them an estate, Immortal treasures, etc…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, within the
imperial clan of the Grand Xia, anyone who became a Celestial
Immortal would see his status suddenly and explosively skyrocket!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This often happened
less than once in a million years…and yet King Yan was the latest,
newest Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of King Yan’s
Estate…” Ning nodded inwardly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess Xiyue is
the only family member King Yan has,” Yu Qi said in a lowered
voice. “King Yan absolutely dotes on Princess Xiyue. He even allows
Princess Xiyue to command the Golden Imperials which the Emperor
bestowed upon him. He even gave Princess Xiyue a pair of azure
phoenix Godbeasts, having them pull her carriage for her. Those two
azure phoenixes have incomparably exalted lineages; although they are
only at the Primal level, each of them have the combat power of a
supreme Loose Immortal. As for the Golden Imperials, they are the
absolute elites of the Imperial Guards of the imperial capital. Even
the weakest amongst them is at least a Primal Daoist!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
secretly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azure phoenixes? Golden
Imperials?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess Xiyue
usually remains within King Yan’s Estate and rarely comes out, nor
does she participate in the various gatherings for nobles,” Yu Qi
said in a low voice. “That’s why Princess Xiyue actually isn’t
very well-known. However, given how much King Yan dotes on her, if
she truly was the spoiled, arrogant throwing type, she probably would
be even more famous than Youngflame Nong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why does she
wish to see me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either,” Yu Qi said, shaking his head. “I heard that today, she
came to the Treasure Auction along with Fairy Azurewillow of our
Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Perhaps she grew curious upon seeing
you, and so she wishes to meet you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated a
moment, then nodded. “Fine. Lead the way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Qi laughed. “Follow
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s Zifu
region. The underwater estate was located there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
there was no way to put people within storage treasures, but estate
treasures were capable of holding people. Ning’s Primaltwin
continued to reside within the underwater estate. There, within the
main hall, a black-robed Ning was seated in the lotus position, a
jade bottle placed in front of him. Within the jade bottle, there was
a total of 60,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence. This came
from the earlier trade he had engaged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
opened his mouth. Instantly, the liquefied elemental essence began to
flow in a continuous stream towards Ning’s mouth, and his power
began to quickly rise. Just a few moments later, he broke through to
the peak Primal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” After
stabilizing his power base slightly, the black-robed Ning came to a
halt. “Mm.” The black-robed Ning looked at the jade bottle. “More
than 15,000 kilograms remain. My Primaltwin has broken through to the
peak Primal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past year after
forging his Primaltwin, the divine soul of the Primaltwin had
advanced at a frightfully fast pace. This was because of the Primal
nurturing effect; thus, his Primaltwin had advanced even more quickly
in soul power than his true body had! The Primaltwin’s divine sense
could now stretch to a distance of 1600 kilometers, while his main
body’s divine sense had only just recovered to the pre-splitting
level of power, just barely reaching 1000 kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful soul! A high
level of comprehension! A mighty Dao-heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reaching the peak
Primal level, the Primaltwin was virtually instantly able to fully
control his elemental ki. Everything was as familiar to him as the
back of his hand; there wasn’t the slightest bit of discomfort at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flying swords.”
The black-robed Ning willed it. Whoosh! Instantly, the surrounding
area, with a swish swish swish series of sounds, became filled with
405 flying swords, each of which emanated mighty ripples of power.
Those nine flying swords in the center, in particular, emanated truly
mighty ripples! These 405 flying swords were all Heaven-ranked flying
swords, and 396 of them had been purchased just now at the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those nine other
Heaven-ranked flying swords…more than a year ago, by relying on his
Primaltwin, Ning had overcome the fifth level of the Wargod Hall, and
then chosen from the Heaven-ranked magic items of the Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These nine
Heaven-ranked flying swords were known as the Waterbreaker Godshark
Swords. The primary material for the forging of these swords had been
the body of a slain, primordial nine-headed Godshark that had existed
in the era before the three thousand major worlds had even been born.
These nine flying swords were all quasi-sentient. According to the
rating of the underwater estate, all nine were high-grade
Heaven-ranked flying swords. However, according to the rating system
of the Grand Xia Dynasty, they were absolutely top-grade
Heaven-ranked, and each of them were probably worth 100,000 to
150,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental essence! And with all nine
coming from the same source…the set was probably worth a million
kilograms, and could be traded for a low-grade Immortal-ranked magic
treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, when
Immortal Juhua had owned the underwater estate, he had acquired a
top-grade Heaven-ranked magic treasure as well. By relying on the
magic treasures of the underwater estate…he could’ve gone and
traded them for Immortal-ranked magic treasures..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…he
would only have been able to trade them for low-grade or middle-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To overcome the
Celestial Tribulation? One had to at least have high-grade, or even
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures in order to have a degree
of confidence. It would be best if the magic treasures were also
suited to one’s abilities; that would give an even better chance.
All of the Immortal-ranked magic treasures of the underwater estate
were at least high-grade, and some were even top-grade.
Unfortunately, Immortal Juhua hadn’t had the chance to choose from
them, as he had only been given the chance to do so after becoming a
Loose Immortal and overcoming the seventh level of the Wargod Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation].” The black-robed Ning willed it. With the nine
Waterbreaker Godshark Swords serving as the core, all the other
flying swords were activated. The exquisitely pure elemental ki of a
peak Primal Daoist filled them, and Ning’s powerful soul began to
guide them. All of the flying swords began to ripple as Ning tested
time and time again the limits of his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll drop it by
one level. [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], level four!” The
black-robed Ning was striving to test his might, but Heaven-ranked
magic treasures were on a completely different level than
Earth-ranked magic treasures. Controlling a single Heaven-ranked
magic treasure was at least as hard as controlling more than ten
Earth-ranked magic treasures! Even though Ning was relying on
formation techniques to lessen the difficulty…it was still
extremely hard for him to execute the fourth level of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], level three!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly, more
than two hundred Heaven-ranekd flying swords all began to flutter in
the air, emanating an incomparably powerful ripple of power.
Immediately afterwards, a flying sword appeared in front of Ning’s
chest as well. This flying sword, which managed to completely
manifest, flashed repeatedly with a golden metallic light. Swords
were sharp in weapons; for metallic light to flash off a sword was a
testament to the quality of the sharp aura of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying sword,
flashing with golden light, held power within it that caused even
Ning to feel astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
Although he was only using a bit more than 200 Heaven-ranked magic
treasures, the effect was far more powerful than when he used 700+
Earth-ranked magic treasures. It was a huge increase in power, an
increase of more than just one level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, it
was incredible for Primal Daoists to be able to control even a few
dozen magic treasures. Ning, however, was able to control more than
two hundred, and amongst them were incomparably precious flying
swords such as the Watercutter Godshark Swords. It could be said that
Ning’s soul was at the Earth Immortal level. He controlled a Grand
Dao Domain, and was quite skilled in formations. The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] itself was quite special to begin with. The
combination of these factors was why he was able to control more than
two hundred Heaven-ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By relying on my
sword formation…my Primaltwin is strong enough to compare to
supreme Loose Immortals!” Ning felt a boundless heroic feeling
within his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet,
secluded residence. The windows were all closed, and even the
servants had departed. Within the residence was only Princess Xiyue.
Outside the door, however, there were some servants, and a group of
Golden Imperials remained on constant guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Princess
Xiyue held a cup of warm wine in her hands, unable to suppress the
excitement and nervousness in her heart. “We are finally going to
meet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My cousin. My one
and only little brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue’s
heart was nervous, excited, and tense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a voice rang
out from outside. “Go report to the Princess. Ji Ning has already
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a moment. I’ll
make the report,” a servant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s here!”
Princess Xiyue took a deep breath. This was as nervous as she had
ever been during the past thirty years; she was even more nervous
than when she had met Grandpa for the first time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Qi were
both standing outside the door to the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Treasures
Mountain was simply too vast. It had taken them quite a while to go
from Ning’s previous location to this place. Ning’s Primaltwin
had reached the peak Primal level long ago, and had already begun to
test the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] when they arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Princess is
instructing Ji Ning to enter,” an armored female soldier said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, I’ll leave now. If there’s anything you need, you can find
any staff member of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and ask them to
send a word to me,” Yu Qi laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
help this time, fellow Daoist Yu Qi. If I have any business in the
future, I’ll definitely seek you out again,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the exchange of
farewells, Yu Qi left. As for Ning, he said to the nearby Little Qing
and Whitewater Hound, “Little Qing, Uncle White, wait here a while
for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Uncle
White and Little Qing both believed that there shouldn’t be any
danger, here within the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
entered the courtyard by himself. After entering the courtyard, Ning
felt a surge of mental pressure, due to the troop of Imperial Gods
who were watching him carefully. Moments later, the female guard led
him to a stand-alone residence, then pushed at the door. “The
Princess is inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw a green-robed
woman seated inside. Right at this moment, the green-robed woman
turned to look at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes
intersected.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_20___Sister_And_Brother"></A>
Chapter 20 - Sister And Brother Meet
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning understood that
this green-robed woman in front of him should be Princess Xiyue. From
this first glance…Ning felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity
and closeness towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects,
Princess,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” Princess
Xiyue spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning take
a seat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue,
however, remained standing. She waved her arm, and a series of
formation flags began to fly out, emanating a gray, rippling power.
These nine formation flags penetrated into the wooden floor, and a
series of ripples began to emanate from the formation flags, quickly
covering the entire residence. A series of Dao-seals began to flow
atop the surface of the residence, instantly and completely severing
it from the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now no one can spy
on our conversation,” Princess Xiyue said. “This is a magic
treasure which Grandpa gave me; upon hiding within it and retracting
one’s aura, even Celestial Immortals would find it difficult to
detect you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess, you are
doing this because…?” Ning was puzzled. The Heavenly Treasures
Mountain publicly proclaimed that they would never spy on the
conversations of their customers. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain
relied on the faith of its customers; unless they were willing to pay
a truly high price for it, there was no way they would eavesdrop on
the conversation of two guests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their sterling
reputation had been built up over the course of countless years. The
Heavenly Treasures Mountain wouldn’t dare act rashly in matters
that would affect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to be
careful.” Princess Xiyue looked at Ning. Ning felt his heart
clench; it seemed as though Princess Xiyue hadn’t just invited him
for a simple meeting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I ask you
this.” Princess Xiyue looked at him. “Your mother was Yuchi Snow?
You are a descendant of the Yuchi clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. He wasn’t
willing to discuss his mother with others. “Princess, the
Youngflame clan is pursuing me because they believe me to be one of
the surviving spawn of the Yuchi clan. Although this information is
quite well hidden, for someone like you, Princess, it shouldn’t be
too hard to acquire this type of report.” Ning was rather
displeased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue,
however, revealed a look of delight. She could already tell the truth
from Ning’s reaction. She immediately said, “Actually, I found
out about it long ago, and I even sent people to your West Prefecture
City of Swallow Mountain to investigate. Only, I still couldn’t
quite believe it, so I had to ask you myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning,
surprised and puzzled, asked her, “Princess, you sent people to
Swallow Mountain to investigate? Dare I ask, why did you seek me out,
Princess?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was so cautious,
and her words gave no clues at all. What in the world was this
princess up to?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Princess
Xiyue began to feel rather nervous. Looking at Ning, she said,
“Actually, actually, I, I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just looked at
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually…you are
my little brother.” Princess Xiyue finally said the words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother? My
mother only had one son; me.” Ning immediately shook his head,
refuting these words. However, in his heart, a different idea came to
Ning’s mind…little brother? Could it be that this Princess Xiyue
was the cousin which his mother had always been thinking about, the
final successor to the Yuchi clan’s lineage? 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are my younger
cousin. I’m your older cousin.” Princess Xiyue said, “My
father’s name…was Yuchi Mount!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this thought
had flashed through his mind earlier…when Princess Xiyue said the
words, Ning was still rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…you are a
princess. A princess of the imperial clan of the Grand Xia,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan is only my
maternal grandfather; my mother was of the Xiamang clan, but I am a
true heir of the Yuchi clan. My true name is Yuchi Xiyue.” Princess
Xiyue looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was in a
state of chaos now. In the past, Ning’s uncle, Yuchi Mount, had
given up his life in order to block the forces of Snowdragon Mountain
and protect his pregnant little sister, Ning’s mother. He had been
the strongest one of their group, but he had died. In doing so, he
had allowed Ning’s parents, Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow, to escape
with their lives. The bitter seeds sown in that year, however…had
caused his parents to only live for a fairly brief period of time.
Ning’s father had always felt guilt towards Ning’s uncle, and
even more guilt towards his daughter, whom they had never seen
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly
speaking…although Ning also carried the blood of the Yuchi clan in
his veins, he was a child of the Ji clan! Only his older cousin…only
she, and she alone, was a true member of the Yuchi clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your name is Yuchi
Xiyue? Your father was Yuchi Mount?” Ning couldn’t even believe
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Princess
Xiyue nodded heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess…it’s
not that I don’t want to believe you. However, this matter is of
tremendous importance to me. We have to test our blood together.”
Ning’s heart was filled with excitement as well. Actually, upon
Princess Xiyue saying that she was the daughter of Ning’s uncle,
Ning had already been mostly convinced. This was because…very, very
few people knew about Ning’s uncle. As for the fact that Ning’s
uncle had a daughter, even within the Ji clan, only Ning and his
parents knew about it. His parents had already passed away. No one
else could possibly know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself had never
before revealed this to anyone. And so, this Princess Xiyue who stood
in front of him was indeed quite possibly his own cousin, who he had
never seen before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let me test
our blood.” Princess Xiyue immediately slashed out with her
fingernail, using it as the tip of a dagger to prick her own wrist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Instantly,
fresh, scarlet blood flicked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched out his
own wrist, using his own finger to cut it as well. After he cut his
own wrist and the blood flew out, the wound on his wrist instantly
healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two drops of
blood flew towards each other in midair, forming into two small
spheres of blood. These two spheres of blood swiveled around each
other, and as they did, Ning executed a technique that would cause
blood from the same lineage to resonate with each other. Instantly,
golden runes began to flash atop the two spheres of blood.
Whooooooosh. Slowly…strands of golden blood began to appear above
the two spheres of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two strands of
golden blood quickly began to ravel around each other, forming into
one. There was no way to tell them apart now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true!” Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true. It’s
true!” Princess Xiyue revealed a look of excitement and joy as
well. Although she had engaged in deep, thorough investigations,
those couldn’t compare to testing their blood lineage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin…” Ning
stared at Princess Xiyue, still in a shaken state. This news had
simply arrived too quickly. He had truly been caught caught
off-guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.
Little brother.” Princess Xiyue excitedly stretched her hands out,
clutching at Ning’s own hands. Because she had mentally prepared
herself over the course of the past year, she had been desiring to
meet Ning this entire time. She simply hadn’t been able to find
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My cousin is
Princess Xiyue? A princess of the imperial clan of the Grand Xia?”
Ning still couldn’t believe this was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue let out
a long sigh, then said, “What’s the point of being a princess?
It’s all too late…Grandpa came too late. If he had come a bit
earlier, then my father, my mother, and even Aunt…none of those
tragedies would have occurred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened? The
exalted King Yan just allowed his own daughter and son-in-law to die,
without even responding to it?” Ning couldn’t help but say these
words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t
understand the situation back then.” Princess Xiyue said slowly,
“Grandpa was of an extremely distant branch of the imperial clan of
the Grand Xia. Even though he worked hard and trained to become a
Void-level Earth Immortal, all he received was a few treasures from
the imperial clan that were mandated by the rules. Every single
person who became an Earth Immortal would be bestowed those
treasures. That was it; just a few treasures. After that? They no
longer paid any attention to my grandfather. His status within the
imperial clan of the Grand Xia remained low.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He could
understand. Just look at the Ji clan; the Ji clan had only been
within the Swallow Mountain region for a comparatively short period
of time, but the number of clansmen it had was truly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial clan of
the Grand Xia had begun to establish itself as soon as this major
world had been born. From then til now, countless, unfathomable
numbers of eons had passed. The passage of so much time had caused
the imperial clan of the Grand Xia to possess an utterly breathtaking
population; just the number of people with the surname of Xiamang was
beyond number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Earth Immortals
and Loose Immortals? Within the Black-White College, they might be
major figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Youngflame
clan, they might be considered fairly powerful figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But within the imperial
clan of the Grand Xia? They’d just be given a few treasures, and
then let loose to live or die on their own merits. If they were to
fail their tribulation and perish, the imperial clan of the Grand Xia
wouldn’t even notice! Only those who succeeded in overcoming their
tribulation…only then would they suddenly ascend to the heavens in
status. The imperial clan of the Grand Xia would immediately bestow
all sorts of treasures, estates, and guards to them, treating them
with incomparable importance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My grandfather had
average talent, and trained very slowly,” Princess Xiyue said
slowly. “There are very few members of the imperial clan of the
Grand Xia who are viewed as important. Grandpa wasn’t one of
them…and so he went out to adventure, tempering himself between
life and death, striving to encounter a major twist of fate. In fact,
he even trained in some evil, demonic secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evil, demonic secret
arts?” Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When facing
the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, he even activated his
evil demonic arts to voluntarily draw more demonic mental attacks to
himself, causing them to grow even stronger,” Princess Xiyue said.
“The more powerful those demonic mental attacks, the more his own
Dao-heart could be tempered and the stronger it would grow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an absolute
madman.” Ning was utterly astonished now. The Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations…all Immortal cultivators were terrified of them
and wanted to come up with ways to weaken them. But this King Yan
actually came up with a method to cause the demonic mental attacks to
become even more powerful, so as to temper himself? Yes, this did
indeed have the effect of strengthening his Dao-heart, and it was
astonishing effective, but…if he failed, he would’ve died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once, Grandpa was
successfully enticed and seduced by the demonic mental attacks. That
was incredibly dangerous,” Princess Xiyue said. “In fact, he
completely transformed into a crazed demon, and he began to torture
and rape women with wild abandon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Be driven into an insane state during the Three
Calamities and Nine Tribulations? That virtually guaranteed death.
Many of the major demons and vile figures were born after having been
driven into an insane state. They would die in their insanity, unless
some sort of a miracle occurred, allowing them to reawaken from their
crazed state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, a
miracle occurred and Grandpa came back to his senses. The process of
entering an insane demonic state and then recovering was tremendously
beneficial to Grandpa. Afterwards, he endured all sorts of trials and
tests, and in the end he actually overcame the Celestial Tribulation,
becoming a Celestial Immortal.” Princess Xiyue sighed with emotion.
“After becoming a Celestial Immortal, he could sense those of his
bloodline. He could sense that he had family still alive, and so he
began to search. In the end…he found me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My grandmother…she
was one of the countless women who he raped in the past. After being
raped, Grandma gave birth to Mother. Because this was an
out-of-wedlock birth, they were all viewed with contempt by the other
clansmen on our island. They shunned the two of them…and in the
end, Grandma died in depression.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then Father arrived
on our island. He had grown weary of fleeing. He wanted to live
permanently on this island. He wanted to take Mother as his wife, and
continue the lineage of our Yuchi clan. Father and Mother joined
together…and in the end, I was born.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those were the
happiest years of my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father was an
Immortal cultivator, and would often fly out of the island to other
places. However, he would always come back very quickly. One day,
Father said that his little sister and his brother-in-law wanted to
leave the Darknorth Seas and return to the mainland. Father said that
his little sister was pregnant and that he was worried about her, so
he was going to personally escort them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…when Father
left, he never returned. The life-tablet he left at home shattered.
Mother couldn’t bear this mental blow, and filled with both grief
and agony, she perished as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lived by myself,
there on that island. Afterwards…Grandpa came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa had already
become a Celestial Immortal by then, but he had no family members of
his own. All of his closest family members had died. I was the only
family member left, his one and only granddaughter.” Princess Xiyue
continued to speak slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he was
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of Immortal
cultivation was a lonely one. Although King Yan was a member of the
imperial clan of the Grand Xia, generally speaking, after five or six
generations of separation, one couldn’t truly be described as
‘family’. King Yan’s parents and brothers had died long ago. As
for family, only one was left; his one and only granddaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came with Grandpa
to the imperial capital. I investigate and discovered that our Yuchi
clan had been annihilated by the Youngflame clan.” Hatred was in
the eyes of Princess Xiyue. “From that day forward, I swore an oath
that I, Yuchi Xiyue, would definitely take revenge. I would
definitely destroy the Youngflame clan! And, I’m going to
re-establish the Yuchi clan, fulfilling my father’s dream! This was
what my father had always dreamed of…and I am definitely going to
accomplish it!”

Chapter 21 - The Enemy of the Two Cousins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate the
Youngflame clan?” Ning was stunned. Even though he viewed the
Youngflame clan as a major, powerful foe, deep in his heart, Ning had
the same desire…to utterly eradicated the Youngflame clan, so as to
console the spirit of his mother!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother’s sisters,
father, and family members…the entire Yuchi clan had died in the
hands of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother must have
deeply desired to eradicated the Youngflame clan…but the Youngflame
clan was simply too powerful, so powerful that Yuchi Mount never even
dared to tell Princess Xiyue that their enemy, the one who had
destroyed their clan, was the Youngflame clan. Yuchi Snow had never
told Ning this secret either. This was an ancient tribe that could
rank in the top ten of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty, a might tribe
that had existed from the Fiendgod Era into the present era. Who
would dare claim that they would definitely annihilate a clan such as
this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had this desire in
his heart…but he wouldn’t dare say these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue,
however, did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
hatred in his cousin’s words, a hatred that had forged into a will
that would pay any price and stop at absolutely nothing to accomplish
its goals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was Father’s
dream. Father died…and I’ll do it on his behalf.” Princess
Xiyue ground her teeth. “Even if I fail and die, in failing, I’ll
deliver a vicious bite to the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin,” Ning
couldn’t help but say, “The eradication of the Youngflame clan
isn’t something to be rushed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. I know
that.” Princess Xiyue shook her head. “I haven’t even told
Grandpa of my intentions, because I know that while perhaps the
entire imperial Xiamang clan is capable of wiping out the Youngflame
clan, the imperial clan will not do such a thing. The imperial clan
isn’t willing to pay the price of having the countless tribes under
its command feel frightened, restless, and possibly rebel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the imperial clan
were to wipe out a major tribe, they would have to have a
sufficiently solid excuse! They couldn’t just find a random excuse
to do this. The many marquises of the world weren’t fools, after
all; the Youngflame clan would have had to truly commit a heinous
crime that exceeded the imperial clan’s bottom line before the
imperial clan would eradicate them. Otherwise…if the imperial clan
could just wipe out another clan on a whim, how could the other
marquises feel at ease?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, they would
all revolt together, and by then, this major world would probably
once more enter into a state of chaotic war, just like in the
Fiendgod Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons why
the imperial clan of the Grand Xia had been able to unify the world
was because many tribes had given them their support and subordinated
themselves to it. If these tribes were to all revolt, then it was
very likely that the imperial clan of the Grand Xia would come to a
calamitous end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why I’m
enduring it for now. There aren’t even many people in the imperial
capital who know that my name is actually Yuchi Xiyue. I asked
Grandpa not to tell others,” Princess Xiyue said. “I don’t want
to cause the Youngflame clan to be on guard against me. I will find a
chance, seek out all opportunities, and use any means necessary. When
I act, I will make sure that this Youngflame clan is wiped out…and
even if I fail, I’ll make them suffer a grievous wound.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, what are you
planning?” Ning was quite puzzled. His cousin had an ordinary level
of power; to annihilate the Youngflame clan? Not even a Celestial
Immortal would dare say such things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had your
talent, I would definitely work hard to train and become a Celestial
Immortal. Upon becoming a Celestial Immortal, I will have as much
time as I need to slowly work against them.” Princess Xiyue shook
her head. “But I don’t have your talent, so I’ll have to borrow
power from others. I plan to borrow the power of the imperial clan of
the Grandn Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Borrow power?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial clan of
the Grand Xia doesn’t have enough of a reason to wipe them out.
So…I’ll have to come up with a way to give them enough of a
reason,” Princess Xiyue said. “Even if I have to use my own
life…it will be worth it. But I know that even if I sacrifice
myself, it will still be quite hard. No matter how hard it is,
however, I’ll strive to accomplish it. I’ll slowly wait…silently
wait…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue seemed
to have transformed into a vengeful, venomous viper; she was silently
waiting, waiting for the moment to deliver her final blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To annihilate the
Youngflame clan in my lifetime will be very, very hard.” Resolve
flashed through Princess Xiyue’s eyes. “That’s why I’m going
to find a husband. I’m not going to marry out; I’m going to bring
one in. The children I give birth to will follow me in publicly using
the surname ‘Chi’. My children will have children of their own,
and our family will grow from one generation to the next…and the
ultimate goal of my descendants will be bringing down the Youngflame
clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have Grandpa
backing me up; I’m his only family member. Even if I die, I’ll
beg Grandpa to help me take care of the Chi clan,” Princess Xiyue
said. “Grandpa is a Celestial Immortal Patriarch of the imperial
clan of the Grand Xia; with his protection, the Chi clan will
definitely grow stronger and stronger. When the Chi clan itself gives
birth to a Celestial Immortal, or when the Youngflame clan is finally
annihilated, the Chi clan will truly return to becoming the ‘Yuchi’
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath. He couldn’t help but feel his heart quiver at the hatred
contained within his cousin’s words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes. She was different
from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a child of the
Ji clan; this was why his mother, Yuchi Snow, didn’t even mention
the Yuchi clan’s feud. In turn, the hatred he felt for the
Youngflame clan hadn’t truly sunk into his bones. But his cousin
was a true descendant of the Yuchi clan. Ning’s uncle, Yuchi Mount,
had trained her from childhood and had told her stories of the former
glory of the Yuchi clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Yuchi Mount
had never told her who their enemies were, Yuchi Mount himself had
always trained hard, always wanting to restore his clan and
strengthen himself enough to take revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue had always
quietly watched her father at work. She knew that her father’s
desire was twofold; to re-establish the Yuchi clan, and to take
revenge! Yuchi Mount was simply suppressing his desire for
revenge…but his daughter could sense the hatred buried within his
heart. This was why she wanted to fulfill her father’s hopes…to
re-establishing the clan, and to take revenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
heart suddenly trembled. “Uncle was the last surviving man of the
Yuchi clan. The amount of hatred he felt must have been tremendous.
My cousin has a similar level of hate towards the Youngflame clan.
What about Mother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa and the
others, they all died…could it be that Mother didn’t feel hate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But after marrying
my father and marrying into my Ji clan, she never mentioned this
matter. She never even displayed any hint of it in front of me.
Perhaps, in private, she would feel agony and hatred on behalf of her
murdered parents and kinsmen.” Ning’s heart suddenly ached. His
mother had never passed any of the hatred she felt to him, precisely
because she didn’t want him to go take revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was afraid that he
would become an egg that tried to smash itself against a rock!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother…you were
worried about me. But in the end, your son has still ended up
fighting against the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is what destiny
is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother, if your son
was nothing more than an ‘ordinary’ supreme genius, it would
indeed be hard to take revenge…but I’m not! I have the legacy of
the primordial Fiendgod, Daoist Threelives. I can easily acquire
Immortal-ranked and even Pure Yang magic items. My divine ability is
a terrifying one that ranks amongst the top ten of the entire Three
Realms. I absolutely have hope of being able to become a power that
dominates the Three Realms. Annihilating the Youngflame clan…I can
do it, I can absolutely do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Resolve flashed in
Ning’s eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin.” Ning
looked towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
Yuchi Xiyue looked towards her little brother, then said in a soft
voice, “I’ve never spoken these words before to anyone else. When
I saw you, those words that I kept hidden in my heart all came
spilling out. Aside from Grandpa…you are my only family.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Cousin,
don’t worry. Becoming a Void-level Earth Immortal, to me, is
absolutely not a problem at all. It will happen without any
impediments! Even dealing with the Celestial Tribulation and becoming
a Celestial Immortal…although it will be hard, I can do it. I
definitely will do it. Dealing with the Youngflame clan isn’t just
your personal issue; it’s mine as well. The Youngflame clan and I
are already like fire and water; either they will extinguish me, or
I’ll extinguish them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
Yuchi Xiyue felt a warm feeling in her heart. Although the two knew
exactly how hard it would be for one to overcome the Celestial
Tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal…neither of them said
such things right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, the two
of them still had their resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us,
brother and sister, will join hands and annihilate the Youngflame
clan.” Ning tightly clasped his cousin’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Hand in hand,
we will annihilate the Youngflame clan.” Yuchi Xiyue nodded in
excitement as well. “The two of us shall be of one heart, and our
will shall be sharp enough to cut metal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us shall
be of one heart, and our will shall be sharp enough to cut metal.”
Ning nodded heavily as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this day. In this
moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Auction
was still underway. Immortal Floatcloud was still on the street
outside, waiting for and wanting to assassinate Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue and Ji
Ning, a pair of cousins, truly joined forces against their common
foe…the Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With two massive azure
phoenixes pulling from up ahead, an Immortal carriage, wreathed in
golden flames, flew into the skies of the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. There were some servants by its side, and a large amount of
Golden Imperials protecting its perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue and Ji
Ning were both seated within the carriage. The Whitewater Hound was
lying on one side, while Little Qing remained wrapped around Ning’s
arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while ago,
when Princess Xiyue had pulled Ning into the Immortal carriage, the
maidservants were speaking out about how this action was
inappropriate, for fear that Ning might be an assassin. Still, given
how the princess always followed her own plans…there was naturally
nothing they could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the imperial
capital, it’s quite common for geniuses to be pulled into and share
carriages as part of a befriending process,” Princess Xiyue sent
mentally. “If you are going to invite a genius to be your friend,
can it be that you’d seat yourself in your carriage, then have him
fly alongside it? That would be a show of absolute disrespect to such
a peerless genius. Am I right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could only let out
a helpless laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go take up
residence in the Raindragon Guard headquarters. Although it’s safe
there, there’s too many people and too many eyes. The Raindragon
Guards of the Youngflame clan will definitely be keeping watch over
you, and all of your actions will be under complete surveillance.
Better to come to King Yan’s Estate. There will be absolutely no
one who will make trouble for you,” Princess Xiyue sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. It was true that his earlier plan had been to live at the
Raindragon Guard headquarters in the imperial capital. The Raindragon
Godpeak was an absolutely secure location; the Godpeak was higher
than even the Skylight Palace, which meant that the martial power
hidden within it was surely endlessly amazing. Not even Celestial
Immortals would dare to act rashly within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…plans never
keep pace with events. He had run into his cousin, and so he would
now go to the estate of a king of the imperial clan of the Grand Xia.
Naturally, it was also extremely safe there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Golden
Imperials…two of them are Immortals?” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother, you
truly are impressive. Right; these hundred Golden Imperials include
98 Primal Daoists and two Loose Immortals. These are definitely the
most elite soldiers amongst the Imperial Guard of the imperial
capital. They had originally been bestowed upon Grandpa, who ordered
them to obey my commands. This time, I only brought out two small
squad. Every single squad has one Loose Immortal and 49 Primal Daoist
who can join together into a Dao-soldier formation. If two squads
join forces, even tens of Loose Immortals would find it difficult to
defeat them,” Princess Xiyue sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement upon hearing this. The imperial clan of the Grand Xia truly
was extraordinary in its resources.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, we’ll only
need to send out a single squad to annihilate that ‘Snowdragon
Mountain’ you spoke of.” A fierce look flashed through Princess
Xiyue’s eyes. “I’ll have Grandpa give the Northmont clan of
Stillwater advance notice. They absolutely won’t argue about it. A
sect that doesn’t even have a single Earth Immortal or Loose
Immortal? If they get wiped out, they get wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
Previously, during their discussion in the residence, they had spoken
of how Yuchi Mount had been killed by Snowdragon Mountain’s men. Yu
Dong and Shui Yi had already died, leaving behind only Dong Seven,
who remained on Snowdragon Mountain. Because Ning had been pursued by
the Youngflame clan, he absolutely didn’t dare to spend time
fighting at or attacking Snowdragon Mountain. Upon being encircled
and trapped there, he would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Annihilating Snowdragon
Mountain? To Ji Ning, that was a bit tricky. But for Princess Xiyue?
It was much easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why isn’t he out
yet?” Immortal Floatcloud, who had been waiting on the streets
outside for quite some time, was frowning. He had been waiting for a
very long time now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, an
azure-robed servant emerged from the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
headquarters, hurriedly sending mentally, “Senior, Ji Ning emerged,
but he’s with Princess Xiyue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princesss Xiyue?!”
Immortal Floatcloud was flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few seconds
later, an incomparably beautiful and noble pair of azure phoenix
Godbeasts flew out, pulling an Immortal carriage wreathed in golden
flames. A green-robed woman was seated alongside Ning within it, and
next to them lay a Whitewater Hound. In front of them and behind them
was a troop of Golden Imperials, emanating powerful auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but, but…”
Immortal Floatcloud was completely poleaxed. “Two azure phoenix
Godbeasts? A hundred Golden Imperials? I…how the hell am I supposed
to assassinate him?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - King Yan, Yama-King
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two azure phoenix
Godbeasts were both comparable to supreme Loose Immortals in power.
Those two squads of Golden Imperials were even mightier! Even ten
Immortal Floatclouds wouldn’t be able to do anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…what should I
do? He’s with Princess Xiyue. How am I supposed to kill him?”
Immortal Floatcloud began to briefly panic, but he quickly came back
ot his senses. “Princess Xiyue is a woman, and she never met Ji
Ning before. This is just their first meeting; she wants to befriend
him, which is why they are sharing an Immortal carriage…I imagine
that in a short while, they will separate, and Ji Ning will return to
his residence, while Princess Xiyue will go back to her royal
residence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll follow them.
Once they separate, I’ll kill Ji Ning.” Immortal Floatcloud
immediately sent a mental order to his subordinates, ordering them to
follow. He stayed far away behind them, so as to avoid being
discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spies of the
Youngflame clan quietly followed, only to discover that Ji Ning and
Princess Xiyue actually weren’t separating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure phoenixes
pulled the Immortal carriage whistling through the air, all the way
to King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Princess
Xiyue disembarked from the Immortal carriage. Ning, too, led the
Whitewater Hound out of the carriage, following Princess Xiyue into
the royal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, Ji Ning and
Princess Xiyue both entered King Yan’s Estate,” the spy
immediately reported back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Entered the
royal estate?! Ji Ning entered King Yan’s Estate?!” Immortal
Floatcloud couldn’t even believe it. “Keep watching! I refuse to
believe he won’t come out. As soon as he does, immediately report
it to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The spy
resumed his watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan’s Estate
took up a large amount of space, but it was fairly cold and pristine.
This was because although most kings had many friends and relatives
with them, King Yan had only a single family member; Princess Xiyue.
This caused the estate to feel cold and clean. Still, King Yan was a
newly ascended Celestial Immortal; most likely in a thousand years or
ten thousand years, this estate would become incredibly lively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The royal estate is
quite large,” Princess Xiyue said with a laugh. “Many places are
unoccupied. Later, I’ll accompany you in picking out a place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone says that
it is hard finding a place to stay in the imperial capital, and that
most Immortal cultivators can’t even afford it,” Ning laughed. “I
didn’t expect that I, Ji Ning, would actually be able to pick and
choose. It seems my luck isn’t bad!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue laughed
as well. The two walked together, chatting and laughing. The two
female soldier-servants following them were quite surprised; their
princess was quite solitary and rarely made friends she could chat
with. Those she did make friends with were all women. For her to chat
so happily with a young man….they had never seen this before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue, bring Ji Ning
to my place.” A voice suddenly echoed in Princess Xiyue’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Princess Xiyue said. “My Grandpa wants to see you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan wishes to
see me?” Ning felt a surge of nervousness. He knew that King Yan
was a friend and not an enemy…but he was still a Celestial
Immortal! Ning had never before seen a Celestial Immortal Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps the Lord of Cui
Palace Ning had met in the Netherworld Kingdom was a Celestial
Immortal, or even more powerful than a Celestial Immortal…but Ning
had been a mere mortal soul, and the Lord of Cui Palace had
completely hidden and suppressed his aura of power. Ning couldn’t
sense the Lord of Cui Palace’s level of power at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, things
were different. Ning was an Immortal cultivator, and his soul was
comparable to a supreme Loose Immortal’s. He now understood more
than ever before how powerful Celestial Immortals were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Princess Xiyue laughed as she pulled at Ning’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are holding
hands?!” The eyes of two female soldier-servants escorting them
turned completely round. “Can the princess actually have fallen for
Ji Ning?” The two were personal maidservants; although they were
stunned, there was no way they would speak of what they had seen.
Every single personal servant had sworn certain oaths to the Dao of
the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A very short time
later. Princess Xiyue led Ning towards a graceful mountain. King
Yan’s Estate spanned a thousand kilometers, and so the insides of
it were naturally filled with winding mountain ranges, and even some
lakes and pools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place, Skygazer
Mountain, is the place which Grandpa likes to come to the most,”
Princess Xiyue said. “Servants are forbidden from coming up the
mountain. Usually, I’m the only one who goes up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing nand Uncle
White were left at the base of the mountain, not coming up; after
all, King Yan had only said that he wanted to meet with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very summit of
othe mountain peak, there was an old, gnarled, twisted tree. Next to
it, there was a pavilion, which had a single table, a single chair,
and a single person within it! This was a tall, muscular man who was
dressed in a long black robe. He quietly sat there by himself,
drinking wine and staring at the vast landscape around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, it
seemed as though the sky, the earth, and the man were all one being.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa,” Princess
Xiyue called out, her voice breaking the stillness. Only then did the
man rise to his feet, turning to stare at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was more than eight
feet tall, and his eyebrows were crow-black and almost excessively
thick. The eyes below the brows were staring straight at Ji Ning.
Ning, in turn, was looking back at King Yan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everying in the
surrounding area completely vanished. Ning could only sense an
infinite, baleful aura, a baleful aura that filled the skies and
covered the earth, so strong as to cause even Ning to feel fear.
However, Ning’s soul was powerful and his Dao-heart was sturdy; his
sword-soul quickly stabilized itself, allowing him to escape that
state a short moment later. Ning looked at the man in front of him.
“What a King Yan! He didn’t even try to consciously attack me; he
just revealed the baleful aura contained within his body, but it was
almost enough to cause me to lose myself within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin said that her
grandpa had only an ordinary level of talent, and wasn’t even
viewed as important by the imperial clan of the Grand Xia…but he
dared to use evil, demonic techniques and even strengthen the demonic
mental attacks of the calamities to temper himself. This is a very
crazy fellow…and because of his craziness, although his talent was
clearly ordinary, he managed to force his way into becoming a
Celestial Immortal.” Ning knew quite well that it was rare for even
a single Celestial Immortal to emerge within the Grand Xia Empire
over the span of a million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan’s talent had
been ordinary for an Earth Immortal, but he had succeeded in becoming
a Celestial Immortal. He most assuredly had his own terrifying
secrets. Everything else aside, that baleful aura contained within
his gaze…that alone was enough to make Ning understand that this
person before him had definitely undergone terrifying experiences.
Otherwise, there was no way the baleful aura could be so strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning pays his
respects to you, King Yan.” Ning respectfully bowed deeply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad. You’ve
only trained for thirty years, but your Dao-heart wasn’t moved by
my baleful aura; you instantly threw it off.” King Yan nodded
slightly, then said with a calm smile, “Formidable, formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue said,
surprised, “Grandpa, you just praised him as ‘formidable’ twice
in a row? I’ve never seen you praise someone like that before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue, can it be
that you don’t know Grandpa’s nickname?” King Yan revealed a
hint of smugness in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You mean…Yama-King?”
Xiyue said. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a puzzled
look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yama-King refers to
the Yama Hell-Kings of the Netherworld Kingdom!” Xiyue explained.
“Even I don’t know why Grandpa acquired a nickname like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s precisely
because I became a Celestial Immortal through a life of slaughter
that my baleful aura is this strong. Otherwise, why would others call
me Yama-King?” King Yan laughed smugly. In front of his only
granddaughter, he acted as if he were an ordinary person; if he
wanted to laugh, he would, and if he wanted to be smug, he would. And
if he wanted to be unhappy, he would.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan looked at
Ning. “Which is why it is quite formidable that you are able to
ignore the influence of my baleful aura.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you and
Xiyue are maternal cousins.” King Yan nodded. “I also know that
enmity exists between you and the Youngflame clan. Their roots,
however, are deep and stable; they won’t be so easily uprooted.
Xiyue hasn’t even publicly acknowledged her true surname. However,
you, Ji Ning, have truly gone head-on against the Youngflame clan.
You need to be careful in your day-to-day life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa!” Princess
Xiyue immediately said, “Didn’t you say that Patriarch Arcanum of
the Youngflame clan doted heavily on Youngflame Nong, and would
definitely take revenge for him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I did say
that,” King Yan nodded. “Patriarch Arcanum truly is quite an
unreasonable fellow. Although I’m savage, I can be reasonable. He,
however, is completely unreasonable. That’s why you have to be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you have
more Golden Imperials under your control? Divert a squad to my little
brother,” Xiyue immediately pleaded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. She
had never before mentioned this idea to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden Imperials?”
King an frowned. “Xiyue, the Golden Imperials belong to the
Imperial Guard of the imperial clan of the Grand Xia. Generally
speaking, only members of the imperial clan will have Imperial Guards
with them. You are a princess, so it doesn’t matter that you have
them with you, but if Ji Ning were also to have them…this is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa!” Princess
Xiyue said frantically. “His Majesty, the Emperor, bestowed the
Golden Imperials to you for you to command as you see fit, right? I’m
not asking you to give my little brother all the Golden Imperials as
protection, just a single squad. The laws of the imperial clan have
never stated that the Golden Imperials can only protect imperial clan
members.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan shook his
head, letting out a resigned laugh. It was true. There was no way the
laws of the Grand Xia would stipulate that Golden Imperials could
only protect imperial clan members. After all, even the Emperor
himself had his important ministers and subjects, or formidable
independent roving Immortals who he wanted to befriend. For the sake
of showing his grace, he would arrange for some Golden Imperials to
serve these people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine then.” King
Yan nodded. “I’ll arrange for a squad of Golden Imperials. The
worst thing that could happen is some people will mumble about it
behind my back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Grandpa.
Grandpa, you are the best.” Princess Xiyue hugged King Yan by the
arm in quite the friendly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” King Yan
laughed. Only with her, his granddaughter, would he feel the warmth
of family. In front of others…he would always remain the legendary
Yama-King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and thank
my grandpa,” Princess Xiyue said, immediately looking at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, King
Yan,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” King Yan
nodded, then laughed, “Go now. You are quite cautious in front of
me. Xiyue, make the arrangements for your little brother. The royal
estate is quite large; let him choose a place as he pleases, then
have him settle down. There will definitely be no one who will dare
to barge into my estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa, we’ll
leave now.” Xiyue immediately pulled Ning away, and they quickly
descended from Skygazer Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan watched as
Princess Xiyue and Ning went down the mountain. He nodded lightly.
“Xiyue clearly is much happier now. She’s suppressed her hatred
in her heart for too long. In the end, it is family which will allow
her to become a happier person.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan then turned
and sat down again. He sat there, by himself, holding a cup of wine,
staring at this vast, wide world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had arrived at a
grassy area next to a lake. Ning nodded. “Right here. I’ll live
here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here?” Princess
Xiyue was flabbergasted. “But this is a barren place. There’s
nothing but grass here. There’s no place to stay at all. We have
plenty of residences in this royal estate…why are you going to stay
in a barren grassland?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Instantly, an
enormous, beautiful Immortal estate appeared, with beautiful
pavilions and residences that were decorated with paintings and
sculptures. Like golden jade, they stood there, emanating natural
elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fine Immortal
estate.” Princess Xiyue was surprised. “You can actually carry
this Immortal estate with you…it definitely can’t be a cheap
one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This is an
Immortal estate that one can carry at the Wanxiang level; it’s
worth at least half a million kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence,” Ning said. Actually, this Immortal estate was one which
the giant yellow bear had given to Ning, free of charge; although it
was a ‘gift’, Ning was absolutely forbidden from selling it. This
was because within this Immortal estate which worth half a million
kilograms, there was a region where the underwater estate was
secreted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate, inside the Immortal estate, there were layers on layers of
protective formations. It was definitely a completely safe spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half a million
kilograms? Nice.” Princess Xiyue said, “Is this Youngflame Nong’s
as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. I acquired it by
luck,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it. For you
to be able to kill Youngflame Nong and a Primal-level Fiendgod means
that you definitely must have had some tremendous strokes of
fortune.” Princess Xiyue laughed, “Alright, go inside and get
some rest. When night comes, I’ll prepare a dinner banquet for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get a good rest. You
haven’t had a chance to rest at all after arriving at the imperial
capital.” Princess Xiyue then led her two female soldier-servants
away. As for Ning, he led Uncle White and Little Qing into his own
Immortal estate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Fivecraze Arrives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, has Princess
Xiyue taken a fancy to you? She’s so nice to you. She even brought
you to the royal estate and had you live here.” After they entered
the Immortal estate, Little Qing could no longer refrain from
beginning to jabber at Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, this
princess is indeed treating you quite well. I feel as though she is
being sincere,” the Whitewater Hound said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just grinned, not
explaining. The fact that his cousin’s name was Yuchi Xiyue was a
major secret which she had never before revealed to her servants or
spirit-beasts. Naturally, Ning wouldn’t reveal it either. Although
his spirit-beasts were absolutely loyal to him, sometimes…just
because a person didn’t want to reveal a secret, didn’t mean it
wouldn’t end up being revealed anyhow. For example, weren’t the
members of the Yuchi clan all soul-scoured?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve already
established ourselves here, at the imperial capital of the Grand
Xia,” Ning said. “Next, we’ll just stay for a time here at King
Yan’s Estate, awaiting the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, at the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain, you suppressed many challengers with
your financial might, spending 2.5 million kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence to buy the peacock plumes. I trust that word of
this will quickly spread, and more and more people within the
imperial capital will know of you. Soon, I imagine, some major clans
will invite you over,” Uncle White said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. This was
what he had planned to begin with. He had originally wanted to seek
out various powers, so as to use their strength against the
Youngflame clan. He hadn’t expected he would run into his cousin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no harm
getting to know more of the clans and tribes which are feuding
against the Youngflame clan,” Ning said. “Uncle White, Little
Qing, let me go train in my private room for a time. If there’s
nothing important, don’t call for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning returned
to his own private room. As for the underwater estate…it was
secreted within that very room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the
private room. Within it, there was actually a secondary door. Upon
opening it, he immediately arrived at the enormous main hall of the
underwater estate, filled with those giant prayer mats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was within the main hall, smiling as he looked at Ning. “King Yan
truly is a fine fellow; earlier, when he swept his entire royal
estate with his coresense, he scanned our Immortal estate as well.
When he realized that there were layers of restrictive spells on it,
he didn’t try to send his coresense to penetrate through them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Coresense…this was
something a level higher than even ‘divine sense’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal cultivators
were primarily divided into two categories; the one before and the
one after the Celestial Tribulation. The category before the
tribulation was a category filled with misery and painstaking work,
faced with the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations and countless
dangers. The ‘divine soul’ of this level was independent; even
after becoming a Primal Daoist, although the divine soul would enter
the body of the Primal, it would just be nurtured there within it.
The soul itself was still stand-alone and independent. Independent
souls could divide into two, and the split half could be trained into
a ‘Primaltwin’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second category of
Immortal cultivators was those who had overcome the Celestial
Tribulation. After it, the divine soul and the Primal would truly
fuse together. There would be no distinction between the two; each
would be part of the other. This was a true transformative change,
and over the process of it, the ‘coresense’ would emerge as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a form of
power that was even more formidable than ‘divine sense’. A form
of power that was able to touch on the hidden, underworld currents of
fate and destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This royal estate is
his territory, after all; some Celestial Immortals will carefully
investigate everything which is brought onto their estate, or even
force their way in to take a look. King Yan, however, went out of his
way to avoid scanning this estate again.” The giant yellow bear
nodded in approval; clearly, he was quite approving of the way this
King Yan acted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he insisted on
using his coresense to investigate?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I could forcibly
deny him,” the giant yellow bear said. “Or, I could allow his
coresense in and let him believe that he had already found
everything, when in reality, he would be ridiculously wrong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He then
sat down in the lotus position, and with a wave of his hand, produced
the five peacock plumes. The peacock plumes emanated powerful ripples
of might that were not one whit weaker than that of an ordinary
Immortal-ranked magic treasure. The space and world around them even
seemed to begin to congeal. Still, compared to the Thousandbull
Sword, it was still rather weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity. A
peacock with plumes that manifested from the Five Elements actually
died at the Void-level. If he had overcome the Celestial Tribulation,
the various major powers of the Three Realms would probably fight
over him as a mount,” the giant yellow bear sighed. “The more
monstrously powerful a Godbeast is, the harder it is for them to
overcome the Celestial Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…a mount?” Ning
was speechless. Poor Godbeast; his destiny was just to become a mount
at best?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then stretched out
both of his arms, beginning to absorb the extracted essence of the
Five Elements contained within the five peacock plumes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning executed a special
technique, and his palms began to be covered with the Divine
Starseizer Runes. The divine runes glowed with light, and the round
runes began to spin, vaguely generating a devouring power that seemed
to fill the region. The Five Elements peacock plumes began to try and
resist, not willing to allow the essence of the Five Elements within
theselves be lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, these were
nonliving items; how could they overcome the technique? Slowly, one
strand after another of essence was extracted from and flew out of
the five peacock plumes. They strands were golden, azure,
watery-blue, fire-red, and dark yellow. The five types of essence
continuously flew out and into Ning’s twin hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, Ning’s entire
body began to send out one ripple of power after another as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on. The
five-colored essences continuously flew into Ning’s hands. After a
long period of time, Ning finally put his hands down, halting the
absorption process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s enough.”
After having absorbed enough of the Five Elements essence, Ning began
to activate another technique. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! His twin
hands began to emanate a blinding, pentacolor aura of light. The
strength of the light was incomparably strong! His hands were no
longer ordinary items; they were more like magic treasures, and the
powerful ripples emanating from them vastly surpassed those given off
by Heaven-ranked magic items in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the
pentacolored aura of light swiveled and spun into Ning’s palms,
transforming into a chaotic mash of colors. Immediately afterwards,
the round divine tattoos on Ning’s palms once more began to expand
and become even more profound, with some additional, complicated
diagrams appearing. As they did so, the ripples emanating from them
began to grow even more terrifiyingly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Six Cycles of
the Starseizer]…the second Cycle is completed!” Ning revealed a
look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning
clenched his fists. BOOM! BOOM! Both fists exploded with power,
causing sonic booms. Even the surrounding space, which had been
congealed and frozen by the Five Elements peacock plumes, trembled
and shook, with the energy within beginning to fluctuate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My pair of
hands…they are far more powerful than even Heaven-ranked magic
items. They are comparable to Immortal-ranked magic items now.”
Ning sighed in amazement. “From the first Cycle to the second
Cycle…it truly is a major rise in power. Only after training to the
second Cycle can my Fiendgod body truly explode with the power it
should have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the true
[Starseizing Hand] technique was to transform one’s hands into
weapons. When receiving the legacy, Ning had seen one image after
another of Daoist Threelives using his own hands to launch attacks!
The hands of Daoist Threelives were more terrifying than any magic
treasure. He had no need of any magic treasures. His hands were the
most powerful of magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, used his
hands to control his swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, after
having mastered the second Cycle, your [Starseizing Hand] has already
reached the highest level of power which your current Fiendgod body
can withstand.” The giant yellow bear nodded and said praisingly,
“Train harder. You are only at the eleventh stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; if you were to train to
the tweltfth stage, then you would have an even better chance at the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, if I use the
[Starseizing Hand] at the Conclave…wouldn’t I be revealing
myself? Supposedly, the Conclave will attract attention from some of
the most formidable figures of the Three Realms,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. As
long as you don’t reveal the Divine Starseizer Tattoos, they won’t
be able to realize what you are doing, no matter how many times you
use the technique,” the giant yellow bear said with a laugh. “At
most, they’ll believe that you have access to some sort of powerful
divine ability or secret art…or perhaps they’ll believe that your
weapons, the Darknorth swords, are incredibly powerful. There’s no
way they’ll be able to guess at the true might of your divine
ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no major
power who, just by glancing at your physical body, can recognize the
divine ability you are using,” the giant yellow bear said. “Unless
it’s one of those special attack divine abilities, or those divine
abilities that allow the body to instanteously increase in size.
Those are all immediately recognizable. Aside from that, it’s
incredibly hard to recognize the vast majority of divine abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The giant
yellow bear frowned. “Someone is coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense it as
well. A servant had arrived outside the gates to his Immortal estate.
“I’ll take a look,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly arrived at
the gataes to his Immortal estate. The servant outside it said
respectfully, “Outside our royal estate, a short old man who styles
himself ‘Immortal Fivecraze’ wishes to see you, milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Fivecraze?”
Ning was startled, but he immediately said, “Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the gates to
King Yan’s Estate. There was a rather sloppily dressed short elder
who was waiting here. As Ning appeared at the gates, Ning immediately
cried out in delight, “Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Immortal
Fivecraze beamed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please, come in,
Patriarch.” Ning hurriedly led the way. “Come to my place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Immortal
Fivecraze nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud had
been waiting outside this entire time, waiting for a good opportunity
to assassinate Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, Ji Ning has
arrived at the gates to the royal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he coming out?”
Immortal Floatcloud grew eager and excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. He went back
inside. It seems he was welcoming a short, sloppy-looking old man.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep watching for
me.” Immortal Floatcloud was beginning to grow a bit frantic. When
he had sworn the oath to the Dao of the Heavens, he had said that he
would kill Ji Ning within three days; else, his soul would be
shattered. If Ji Ning continued to hide within King Yan’s estate
for three days and refused to come out, then Immortal Floatcloud
would have no choice but to allow his soul to be destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led Immortal
Fivecraze back to his own Immortal estate, preparing Immortal wine
and fruit for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, how did
you know I was here at King Yan’s Estate?” Ning said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came here for the
express purpose of seeking you out,” Immortal Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seeking me out?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze
nodded. “Right. Your master, Immortal Diancai, has gone out
adventuring. Before doing so, he asked us to all give you a hand. Our
Black-White College is unable to help you directly fight against the
Youngflame clan. The only thing we can do…is give some of the
secret arts and manuals of the school to you. We wanted to do so, but
we weren’t able to find you. Just now, we received word that you
had appeared in the Heavenly Treasures Mountain of the imperial
capital. Only after I arrived at and searched everywhere in the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain did I learn that you had entered King
Yan’s Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve brought
scrolls for your Ki Refining Technique and your Fiendgod Body
Refining Techniques over,” Immortal Fivecraze said. “Also the
divine abilities and secret arts of our College; I’ve brought all
of them as well. Look at and memorize all of them; after memorizing
each one, destroy it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, thirty-six
formation flags suddenly appeared in midair around them. As they
hovered there, they emanated a series of pulses of light which
covered the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even Celestial
Immortals can think about spying on you.” Immortal Fivecraze looked
at Ji Ning. “Hurry up and view them.” As he spoke, he offered
them to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. So
Immortal Fivecraze had hurried all the way from Stillwater Commandery
to deliver him divine abilities and secret arts?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t stand there
like a fool. You are a student of the Black-White College; you are
supposed to be able to train in these anyhow. The point of those
so-called black-white pellets is just to ensure that you will work
hard and test yourself. We can’t just give everything to you
without making you work for it, right?” Immortal Fivecraze sighed.
“This is all the Black-White College can do for you now…”

Chapter 24 - Invitation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s eyes stung.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing
Youngflame Nong, Ning had never hoped for the Black-White College to
help him, their disciple. In truth, he felt guilt towards the
Black-White College. Because of him…the relationship between the
Black-White College and the Youngflame clan had almost assuredly
turned quite stiff. Thus, Ning had only planned to rely on his own
power to fight against the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…Master went
out adventuring?” Ning asked, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Your
matter…your master is unable to assist you in resolving it. This
had a tremendous impact on your master. In addition, he isn’t
certain of his ability to overcome the Celestial Tribulation. Thus,
he is going to go out and adventure and temper himself.” Immortal
Fivecraze said with a sigh, “However…how can the matters of the
world always go as you desire them to go? Your master is too stubborn
and fixated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say a
word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and read.”
Immortal Fivecraze handed the [Flowing Watersource] to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. No matter how many thoughts he had in his mind, given his
power was insufficient, those thoughts were useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past life, or
in this life…my goal is to have my destiny in my own hands.” That
powerful desire filling Ning’s heart continued to cause his
Dao-heart to grow firmer. He flipped through the second half of the
[Flowing Watersource], memorizing it carefully. After doing so, a
flame emerged from Ning’s hand which completely burned the book
into ash. Next, Immortal Fivecraze gave him the third scroll for the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The full copy of the
[Flowing Watersource]. The third scroll of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens]. The full copy of [Heavenly Transformation]. The
full copy of the [Divine Thunderbolt Eye]. The full copy of the
[Myriad Hibernating Venoms]. The full copy of [Three Heads, Six
Arms]. The full copy of the [Eye of the Luminous Heart]. The full
copy of the [Soulshaker Art]. The full copy of the [Soulcharmer Art].
The full copy of the [Soulslayer Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what Immortal
Fivecraze had brought him. Almost all of the most important divine
abilities and secret arts of the Black-White College; he had brought
them all for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After each read, Ning
would burn the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the divine
abilities took up ten full books. Immortal cultivators had utterly
astonishing memories, but Ning still needed to read all the way to
the dawn of the next day before completely memorizing all of the
techniques. But of course, halfway through the process, Ning had
taken a break and taken the Patriarch to participate in the dinner
banquet which Princess Xiyue had prepared for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to see me
off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was at the gates
to the royal estate, sending off Immortal Fivecraze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…”
Immortal Fivecraze looked towards Ning, then said with a laugh, “Last
night, I could tell from the banquet that King Yan treats you with
great importance. He is a Celestial Immortal Patriarch, and yet he
views you so highly; you need to work hard! Every bit of help the
Black-White College can possibly give you, we have already! As for
myself, I’m just trying to overcome as many tribulations as I can
before succumbing. I don’t have much time left to me. I truly hope
to be able to see one of the disciples of the Black-White College
become a Celestial Immortal. Your master is striving to do this; you
need to as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the imperial
capital, when you are alone, you need to be careful.” Immortal
Fivecraze cracked a smile. “Since you are going to the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, you need to go all out. If you can apprentice
yourself to a major power of the Three Realms…by then, the
Youngflame clan will be completely stupefied.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’m going
to go all out.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’m
leaving now.” Immortal Fivecraze turned and left. He was holding up
his calabash of wine, appearing to be quite relaxed and at ease.
Moments later, he disappeared from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath. In this moment…Ning felt an incomparably powerful sense of
belonging for the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how much
time passes…I, Ji Ning, shall forever be a disciple of the
Black-White College.” These were the words Ning said silently to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning turned
and returned to the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, Ji Ning came
to the entrance of the royal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming out?”
Immortal Floatcloud asked frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He just went back
inside again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud’s
face was filled with indisguisable franticness. He barked, “Keep
watching!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was a Loose
Immortal, and although he was extremely patient…he had already
sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens before Patriarch Arcanum. He
had to kill Ji Ning within three days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s already been
a day and a half!” Immortal Floatcloud said frantically to himself,
“Ji Ning, oh, Ji Ning…are you going to stay inside the entire
time? Then my death will really have been for nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within King Yan’s
Estate. The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, that fellow
named Fivecraze brought over quite a few divine abilities and secret
arts. The secret arts are one thing; you can do as you please. But of
the divine abilities, you absolutely cannot train in the [Myriad
Hibernating Venoms]. Absolutely not,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ji Ning said,
surprised, “This [Myriad Hibernating Venoms] is said to be one of
the most powerful divine abilities the Black-White College possesses;
the cost in black-white pellets is as high as the [Eye of the
Luminous Heart]. They are the most expensive of all. And isn’t it
better to have as many divine abilities as possible? There shouldn’t
be any issues.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
shook his head. “Yes, the more divine abilities the better,
but…training in divine abilities will distract you take up your
time, won’t it? As for the [Myriad Hibernating Venoms], you will
need to use more than ten thousand types of strange venoms in order
to train in it. Searching for and acquiring so many venoms will cost
you a great deal, and merging those venoms into your body is
extremely troublesome. It will cost you a lot of effort, for little
gain! In addition, the more pure a divine body is, the better; fusing
so many venoms into your body isn’t worth shit. In the future,
after you become an Empyrean God, you’d probably have to actually
purify your body of those venoms and actively wipe out the traces of
this divine ability from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the other
divine abilities?” Ning hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Heavenly
Transformation] and [Three Heads, Six Arms]; virtually all of the
Fiendgods of the Three Realms train in these two divine abilities.
Although they are very common, they are still quite useful,” the
giant yellow bear said. “You are definitely going to train in them.
As for the rest? Didn’t you already acquire the [Pentabolt Vajra]?
You can train in both the [Pentabolt Vajra] and the [Divine
Thunderbolt Eye], and the two can actually support each other,
causing both to grow stronger. In addition, in reality, this [Divine
Thunderbolt Eye] is in reality the foundation for one of the supreme
divine abilities of the Three Realms, the [Thundergod’s Eye].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, “So it
really is true that having an old man at home is like having a
treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yep. So you, you
little tyke, need to be more polite to me,” the giant yellow bear
said smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful is that
[Thundergod’s Eye] you spoke of, the one you said is a supreme
divine ability of the Three Realms?” Ning asked, curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst the
countless divine abilities of the Three Realms, it can rank in the
top hundred, I suppose. It’s on a lower level than your
[Starseizing Hand],” the giant yellow bear said. “But it’s
still quite powerful. Anyone who can completely master the
[Thundergod’s Eye] will become a major figure of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. During the
past year, he had already trained the [Pentabolt Vajra], [Soldiers of
the Mind], and [Three Heads, Six Arms] to a very high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s still more
than a year from now until the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. I need
to reach a certain level of accomplishment in the [Divine Thunderbolt
Eye], the [Soulcharmer Art], and the [Soulslayer Art],” Ning mused
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a loud
shout within the underwater estate’s main hall. His forehead
suddenly split apart, revealing a vertical eye-slit. A bolt of
thunder snaked out from it, crashing against the ground of the
distant hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Someone’s
coming? It’s not even dark; dinner hasn’t even begun. Why has a
servant come?” With a thought, Ning willed the Divine Thunderbolt
Eye in his forehead to close. He had just reached a basic level of
understanding of this technique, but the power was already quite
something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning arrived at the
entrance to the Immortal estate, with Uncle White and Little Qing
hurriedly following.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female
soldier-servant at the gate said with a laugh, “The Princess is
asking you to meet her, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded.
“Uncle White, Little Qing, I’m going to make a short trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning arrived at
his cousin’s residence. She was currently within her pavilion, and
in her hands she held a leather scroll that was covered with golden
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, leave,”
Yuchi Xiyue instructed. Soon, the entire courtyard was emptied, save
for Ning and Yuchi Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother,
after you went to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain and tossed out 2.5
million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence to buy the peacock
plumes, word of you spread. Many in the imperial capital now know
about you.” Yuchi Xiyue handed the golden leather scroll to Ning.
“So, someone has already come to invite you to attend a banquet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it and
took a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kindwater clan?”
Ning’s eyes lit up. Ning had already purchased intelligence reports
regarding the various major powers of the imperial capital. Although
he didn’t know the details, he knew the rough situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kindwater clan
and the Youngflame clan are mortal enemies! In addition, the
Kindwater clan is even more powerful than the Youngflame clan.”
Yuchi Xiyue laughed. “According to the stories, back in the
Fiendgod Era, the Kindwater clan led a large number of tribes, as did
the Xiamang clan. The Xiamang clan and the Kindwater clan fought for
a long period of time before the Kindwater clan finally submitted to
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement. He didn’t know about the hidden histories such as these.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back in the Fiendgod
Era, the Kindwater clan even declared themselves as emperors!”
Yuchi Xiyue sighed, moved. “Even after submitting, they still
remain one of the top three clans of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew about this
part. As for the leader of the top three clans, that was of course
the imperial Xiamang clan! It was they who had unified and controlled
the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the second and
the third, they were the Kindwater clan and the Blackgod clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kindwater clan
and the Youngflame clan have an enormous feud between them. And the
first one to invite me really is the Kindwater clan.” Ning laughed.
“Right. This invited you as well, cousin; they asked you to
accompany me tonight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t go.
Although they invited me, that was just to be polite. I’ve never
liked to get too involved with them,” Yuchi Xiyue said, shaking her
head. “Don’t force me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I won’t try
and compel you, cousin.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led the
Whitewater Hound and Little Qing to the gates of the royal estate.
Outside, fifty Golden Imperials were already congregating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our respects to you,
young master.” The leader of the Imperials, Immortal Plumerider,
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to trouble
you, fellow Daoist Plumerider,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is no trouble.
We are at the command of King Yan; naturally, we will strive to do
our utmost to protect you, young master,” Immortal Plumerider said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and instantly, a large ship appeared. This was a large ship that was
ancient and unadorned, and yet faintly radiated a threatening
presence. This was one of the treasures which Immortal Juhua had left
behind; it was a construct-ship, and was quite a bit more valuable
than even the black dragon carriage that Youngflame Nong had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning,
Uncle White, and Little Qing all boarded the large ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The crowd
of Golden Imperials boarded as well. In a very practiced manner, the
Golden Imperials quickly assumed positions throughout the ship, all
of them vigilant and continuously scanning the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship immediately
released crushing waves of energy as it began to fly towards the
place which the Kindwater clan had invited Ning to meet at. This was
a place that could be considered one of the most exquisite of
entertainment venues; Cloudwater Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
appeared in midair, staring at the distant, enormous warship flying
through the skies. The Golden Imperials standing aboard the warship
caused him even more frustration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My three day
deadline is growing closer and closer. He finally came out, but
why…why is he bringing a squad of Golden Imperials with him? How am
I supposed to kill him when he is protected by Golden Imperials?”
True panic was in the eyes of Immortal Floatcloud now. He truly
didn’t want to end up having no chance to attack, and then being
punished by the Dao of the Heavens by having his soul shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That would be too
unjust!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_25___Cloudwater_Manor"></A>
Chapter 25 - Cloudwater Manor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudwater Manor. It
was built over the massive Ninesun Lake. Wreathed by clouds and mist,
it appeared like an abode for Immortals, built amidst the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large, plain,
ancient-looking warship came cruising forward, flying towards the
Cloudwater Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this young master
Ji Ning?” An attendant had been waiting for quite some time,
outside the Cloudwater Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, leading a group
of Golden Imperials, disembarked from the warship. With a wave of his
hand, he collected it, then walked to the long-awaiting, white-robed,
youthful-looking Primal Daoist. He said, “I am Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per orders from my
young master, I have been here awaiting you, young master Ji Ning.
Young master Ji Ning, please follow me.” The white-robed youth gave
the Golden Imperials behind Ning a glance. His eyelids couldn’t
help but twitch. Someone who could summon a troop of Golden Imperials
when travelling… was definitely no ordinary person. He was
absolutely someone with a background, with a backer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For those important
officials and senior ministers, the backer was the Emperor of the
Grand Xia himself; that was why they would be bestowed with a squad
of Golden Imperials. In turn, only the important figures of the
imperial clan would be bestowed with Golden Imperials. The only
reason Ning had a troop of Golden Imperials was because behind him
stood King Yan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Cloudwater
Manor is quite awe-inspiringly majestic.” A little azure serpent
was wrapped around Ning’s arm, while by his side was a large, snowy
white dog. Behind him was a large group of Golden Imperials. This
impressive troop moved through the Cloudwater Manor, moving swiftly
and unopposed as they glided many kilometers each moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
who was leading the way said with a laugh, “Cloudwater Manor was
only completed after our Kindwater clan spent countless treasures and
three years of time. After its initial creation, countless years of
time were spent to carefully carve and sculpt it. Only after all
these efforts did the Cloudwater Manor before you come into being.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Kindwater clan
lives up to its name. Formidable, formidable,” Ning said in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a mighty tribe
which had once been able to struggle against even the imperial
Xiamang clan over control of the world, a clan that absolutely ranked
amongst the top three clans of this major world. Its roots were
unfathomably deep. One could tell this just by looking at the many
restrictive formations set up on a building like Cloudwater Manor,
which was most likely on par with some of the main headquarters of
other supreme clans. The Kindwater clan had indeed spent boundless
effort on Cloudwater Manor, as the largest business building the
Kindwater clan owned within the imperial capital. Ning’s praise for
it truly came from the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
hearing Ning’s praise, couldn’t help but smile. He then said,
“The young master is right up ahead. He’s prepared a banquet long
ago, and is awaiting you, young master Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I am late,”
Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they arrived at a
long pathway that hung in the air. As they walked through the
pathway, they could look down and see the rippling waves of the lake,
as well as the mist that filled the entire place…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This corridor led to an
enormous building that was at least three thousand meters high. This
building was standalone, and the Cloudwater Manor had only a single
corridor that led to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the doors
to the building, there were two servants standing guard. These
servants were both Wanxiang Adepts. Upon seeing the white-robed
youth, they immediately pushed the door open with tremendous
courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master is
right inside,” the white-robed youth laughed. “This place is
fairly secluded, and it has a wonderful view of the beautiful scenery
of the Ninesuns Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led his troop of
Golden Imperials in, and the door closed behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, brother Ji
Ning truly is extraordinary. Just a short while ago, you spent 2.5
million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence to purchase the
peacock plumes, causing your name to be spread throughout the
imperial capital. Now, shortly after entering King Yan’s Estate,
you actually re-emerged with a squad of Golden Imperials. I have no
choice but to be in awe of you, so much so that I might prostrate
myself before you. Songspear, how about you?” A slightly frivolous
voice spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth dressed in
loose white-robes walked over barefooted, his long hair casually
unbound. His eyes had a seemingly drunk look in them, appearing to be
quite hazy. His face, however, was covered with a warm smile as he
came to welcome them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to his side was a
tall, muscular, black-robed youth. This tall youth nodded as well. “I
am in awe as well. King Yan is notorious for being unapproachable.
He’s quite cold and grim. There are truly very few youngsters who
he views with importance. For brother Ji Ning to be able to emerge in
just two short days with a squad of Golden Imperials…he truly is
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the two, the
white-robed, barefoot youth appeared to be a bit more of a dandy, and
he seemed to be quite free and relaxed. As for the other, the tall,
muscular, black-robed youth, he emanated a sharp, fierce aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind the two was a
man and a woman, who followed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much,” Ning laughed. His invitation to the Cloudwater Manor had
come from Kindwater Xiaolou. Ning naturally knew of Kindwater
Xiaolou, one of the Four Dukelings of the imperial capital. The
white-robed, barefooted youth was Kindwater Xiaolou. Although he and
Youngflame Nong shared the same reputation of being one of the ‘Four
Dukelings’ of the imperial capital, their clans were mortal
enemies, and so the two naturally had been on extremely tense terms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, they
struggled quite viciously against each other. Still, in turns of
resources, personal ability, connections, or tribal strength,
Kindwater Xiaolou was superior to Youngflame Nong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
The white-robed, barefoot Kindwater Xiaolou warmly took Ning by the
hand. “Come, let me make some introductions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou
pointed towards the tall, muscular, black-robed youth. “This person
is the truly peerless genius of the younger generation of the
Skyfarmer clan - Skyfarmer Songspear! Songspear isn’t like me; I
often go out and party, but Songspear is quite low-key. He focuses on
his training, and often goes out to temper himself through
adventuring. In fact, he’s almost never in the imperial capital.
The only reason he’s here right now is the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. Since he just so happened to hear about your matters as
well, Ji Ning, and was curious about you, he told me that he wanted
to meet with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfarmer
Songspear?” Ning was secretly surprised. Amongst those who were
believed to have a good chance of ranking number one in the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny were the likes of Xiamang Zishan, Cangwu Jiu,
Adept Woodpass, and some other exceedingly famous people. Although
Skyfarmer Songspear was comparatively speaking much more low-key, he
was still the most outstanding figure amongst the younger generation
members of the Skyfarmer clan, and was believed to definitely rank in
the top hundred, and in fact was a genius likely to be able to
explode forth with tremendous power. He was too low-key, causing
others to be unable to be certain of his current level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
Songspear laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Songspear.”
Since the man had warmly greeted him as ‘brother Ji Ning’, Ning
naturally wouldn’t treat him coldly. If he were to foolishly
respond to him as ‘fellow Daoist Songspear’, then the man would
probably think Ning was not giving him face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come, come.
Let me introduce you to another person who is taking part in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny.” Xiaolou pointed to a man behind him.
This man was dressed in violet robes, and his skin was pure white and
incomparably beautiful. His eyes even seemed to have a hint of
devilishness to them. “This is a good friend which I met many years
ago; Xiao Lang. He’s definitely one of the most famous of playboys;
in the imperial capital, quite a few maidens are completely smitten
with him, wanting to marry him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he is Xiao Lang?”
Ning said to himself. Xiao Lang was recorded in his intelligence
records as well. He was quite dissolute, and his temperament was a
bit bizarre. Still, in the Heavenly Treasures Mountain’s reports,
he was a figure who was only mentioned; there was no way he could
compare with Skyfarmer Songspear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects to you,
fellow Daoist Ji Ning.” Xiao Lang looked at Ning, clasping his
hands in greeting, a smile that wasn’t a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Xiao
Lang.” Ning nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Songspear
said with a laugh, “I have a good friend as well. I met her while
adventuring in the outside world, and she came back with me to the
imperial capital on this trip. She is also going to participate in
the Conclave.” As he spoke, the alluring, red-robed woman behind
him walked forward. “Wavecolor greets you, fellow Daoist Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Wavecolor,” Ning greeted her as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou,
Skyfarmer Songspear, Xiao Lang, Wavecolor. Ning secretly sighed in
amazement; all four of these figures were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang was a
dissolute figure with a strange personality and a bizarre
temperament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wavecolor was a figure
who was quite famous in the Northern Seas. However, her fame came
primarily due to her beauty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s sit
over there,” Kindwater Xiaolou said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Imperials,
Little Qing, and Uncle White sat down to one side. There were sitting
mats specially prepared for them as well. As for Xiaolou, Songspear,
Xiao Lang, Wavecolor, and Ji Ning, they walked to another place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There, all five of them
sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had originally
planned to invite you, brother Ji Ning, to go stay with me at the
Kindwater Estate. I didn’t expect that you would have ended up
staying at King Yan’s Estate so quickly.” Xiaolou let out a very
regretful sigh, then laughed, “If you ever are dissatisfied with
your accommodations, you can move out and come stay at my Kindwater
Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan treats me
with great kindness, and he cares greatly about me. He’s also
bestowed Golden Imperials onto me; how can I possibly disappoint him
like that?” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what he and
his cousin had decided on as their cover story. To the outside world,
they would only say that King Yan cared about Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true.”
Xiaolou nodded. He didn’t truly expect to be able to pull Ning over
to his side; he was just speaking casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Glug.” Xiao Lang,
seated to one side, drained his cup of wine. He thought to himself,
“This Ji Ning’s only trained for thirty years. How formidable can
he be? He simply managed to kill Youngflame Nong and acquire many
treasures, then spent 2.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence to purchase the peacock plumes. That’s the only reason why
he’s famous in the imperial capital. His luck really is good,
though; Princess Xiyue took a liking to him and brought him to King
Yan’s Estate. Given how much King Yan’s temperament and how much
he dotes on Princess Xiyue…I imagine that it was she who asked King
Yan to send a squad of Golden Imperials to follow Ji Ning around.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang looked down
on Ji Ning. He had been adventuring for many years, and he was much
more famous than Ning! This time, he wanted to truly shine during the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning? A little
fellow who only grew famous through killing Youngflame Nong, and who
relied on a woman to make King Yan care about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, in his heart,
Xiao Lang felt some jealousy…because Ning was able to produce 2.5
million kilograms, while he, Xiao Lang, wasn’t even close to be
able to doing that. Ning was also able to command a squad of Golden
Imperials; how majestic and awe-inspiring as that? Although Xiao Lang
was now living in the Kindwater Estate, how could he move about in as
majestic a manner as Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lucky punk. You
aren’t strong enough. When enough time passes, others will discover
that you are nothing more than lead covered by gold paint.” Xiao
Lang drank there by himself. He couldn’t be bothered to even chat
with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang was a
strange, eccentric figure to begin with. Others didn’t think
anything of this; amongst Immortal cultivators, there were many with
far more bizarre temperaments than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Xiaolou,
Songspear, and Wavecolor were chatting quite happily amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Cloudwater
Manor just recently purchased some strange creatures, all of which
came from one of the lesser worlds. This lesser world is quite
unique; there are thousands of types of bizarre lifeforms within it.
These two can be considered some exceptionally powerful creatures of
this lesser world; each of them are comparable to peak Wanxiang
Adepts in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou
pointed towards the large arena, more than three hundred meters in
diameter, up ahead. There were people carrying enormous metal cages
towards it. Within one of the two metal cages was a golden-haired
giant who was more than ten meters tall, while in the other was and a
strange creature with the lower body of a lion and the upper body of
a human.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s watch these
creatures fight each other. It can be considered someone amusing.”
Xiaolou clapped his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a rumbling
sound could be heard. A grand sealing formation instantly covered the
entire arena. Within it, with clanking sounds, the cages were
automatically unlocked. The golden-haired giant, clad only in beast
furs, came charging out from his cage, with the sphinx charging out
of the other.

Chapter 26 - Provocation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou, Ji
Ning, Skyfarmer Songspear, and the others each held cups of wine,
chatting while watching the battles going on in the center of the
arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation, the golden-haired giant and the sphinx both
charged out of their pens, then raised their heads and let out
bellows. Although the sound of their bellows was blocked out by the
grand sealing formation, the sonic booms were visible from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their physical
bodies are quite powerful. They should be fairly low-level Fiendgod
Body Refiners of a sort.” Fairy Wavecolor laughed, instantly
transforming into a rupturing sight that caused both the
golden-haired giant and the sphinx to stare, stunned, at the alluring
woman outside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even creatures of
other races find it hard to withstand Fairy Wavecolor’s allure,”
Kindwater Xiaolou laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But soon, the
golden-haired giant and the sphinx regained their faculties. The two
now stared fixedly at each other. Ever since the day they had been
seized and brought to this Watercloud Manor, they had been told by
the staff: “One of you must die in every single battle. If you
survive nine in a row, you’ll be able to leave, and you’ll become
a soldier for our Kindwater clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-haired giant
and the sphinx, in their own respective lesser world, were supreme
experts who normally had a group of servants following them. Ever
since that group of terrifying Immortal cultivators had arrived in
their world, however, they had quickly been subjugated, and the two
had become slaves…then sold off to this ‘Kindwater’ clan. When
this had happened, they discovered, to their amazement, that
virtually every single servant of the Kindwater clan was more
powerful than them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt utter
despair. They no longer harbored any hopes for escape. They had no
choice but to obey. They hoped for just one thing - to survive the
nine battles, and then become soldiers of the Kindwater clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goldsea clansman,
prepare to die.” The sphinx bellowed, then sent its four limbs
flying forward as it transformed into a tornado that pounced towards
the golden-haired giant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is you who shall
die!” The giant bent down, charging forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two collided head
on. The sphinx left a bloody wound on the chest of the golden-haired
giant, while the giant’s fist smashed hard against the head of the
sphinx. Blood splattered everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wounds of both
combatants quickly closed, and they continued to battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are indeed
Fiendgod Refiners.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The cultivators of
that lesser world are all Fiendgod Refiners,” Xiaolou said. “Still,
they use the most low level of Fiendgod Body Refining techniques.
Supposedly, the three most powerful figures of that lesser world were
three Fiendgod Body Refiners that were roughly at the Primal level.
They also have extremely poor comprehensions of the Dao. Any Primal
Daoist of our Grand Xia Dynasty could use magic treasures to
effortlessly take care of those three ‘strongest’ figures from
that lesser world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Ki
Refiners required an extremely high level of comprehension of the Dao
so as to control elemental ki well. As for Fiendgod Body Refiners,
comparatively speaking, there wasn’t as high a requirement in terms
of the Dao. Of course, the most supreme [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens] had a ridiculously high level of demand regarding the
Dao. Some of those comparatively poorer techniques, especially those
which could be described as the weakest of Fiendgod Body Refining
techniques, had no requirements with regards to understanding the Dao
at all. However, with such a poor foundation, it was naturally hard
for one to reach a very high level of insight. Training to the
Wanxiang level was essentially the limit; to reach the Primal level
as an Fiendgod Body Refiner was a stroke of tremendous luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their close combat
abilities are roughly at the ‘one with the world’ level,”
Skyfarmer Songspear laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory is about to
be determined,” Xiaolou said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sphinx let out a
savage bellow, charging forward repeatedly with paws flying and hands
grappling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the golden-haired
giant was clearly more nimble, sometimes appearing on the left, other
times appearing on the right. He left behind one massive, gaping
wound after the other on the body of the sphinx, using up the
sphinx’s divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” The
golden-haired giant brushed past those trampling paws, at the same
time stabbing his right hand directly into the chest of the sphinx,
as though his hand was a knife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chest was ripped
open, and blood flew everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The sphinx swiped
out with both hands, and the golden-haired giant hurriedly moved to
block, in the end being knocked flying by the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” the
golden-haired giant laughed wildly, then continued to encircle and
strike at the sphinx with lightning-fast blows, leaving behind
massive wounds on his body each time. In the end, the sphinx’s
divine power was used up, and his wounds would no longer close. His
speed dropped as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch. The
golden-haired giant was like a golden bolt of lightning; he howled
through the air, then caught the sphinx’s head and gave it a hard
twist. The head was forcibly ripped off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Picking up and hoisting
the head aloft with one hand, the golden-haired giant looked as
though he was a victorious general. As for the sphinx, its body
slumped to the ground with a thud, blood staining the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The grand
sealing formation disappeared, and the servants of the Cloudwater
Manor hurriedly moved forward to quickly scrub the ground clean. The
sphinx’s body was disposed of as well, and soon, the arena was now
completely spotless once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reporting to the
young master,” a manager of the Cloudwater Manor said respectfully
while standing within the arena, “This golden-haired giant has
already won nine consecutive victories. According to the rules, he is
now a soldier of our Kindwater clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-haired giant
was standing obediently to the side of that Cloudwater Manor manager.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Xiaolou,
seated high above them, laughed. “What a coincidence for him to win
his ninth victory today. I will bestow you with a flagon of Immortal
nectar. Work hard for my Kindwater clan; my Kindwater clan will
definitely not mistreat our soldiers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, exalted
Immortal.” The golden-haired giant knelt down on one knee, his
voice rumbling. Although his words sounded rather muddy, they were
the words of the human tongue; he was a creature comparable to a
Wanxiang Adept, after all, and was quite intelligent and thus quick
to learn a new tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon afterwards, the
golden-haired giant departed. In his place within the arena appeared
a troop of seductive female dancers, who began to dance with fans
while the sound of music rang out from the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia, these creatures from other worlds are set
to fight each other. When I first arrived at Stillwater City, in the
gambling arena, I fought against those monstrous beasts, as well as
with other humans. Those monstrous beasts and humans weren’t able
to refuse at all; they were forced to obey and go fight. The weak are
given no choices. Only by becoming strong can one have the power to
choose. First, grow strong enough to choose for yourself; only then
can one master one’s own destiny.” This was what Ning was
thinking to himself. Only by constantly reflecting on one’s own
heart and mind could one make one’s Dao-heart continually grow
stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny is a chance for me to be reborn anew and change my
life. I need to rely on the Conclave and make myself even more
powerful through tempering through adversity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of
performances were going on in the center of the arena. Ji Ning and
the others were clinking wine glasses together while watching. As for
the antisocial Xiao Lang, who was rather unhappy to begin with, upon
seeing how courteously Xiaolou and Songspear treated Ning, he was
growing even more unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” Xiao
Lang suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Ning and the
others all looked over. Xiao Lang rarely spoke; since he now spoke,
everyone naturally turned to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The battles of these
creatures aren’t interesting enough. As I see it…why don’t I
have a little spar with fellow Daoist Ji Ning?” Xiao Lang’s eyes
had a hint of desire for battle in them, as well as complete
confidence. “I hear that fellow Daoist Ji Ning’s power is
formidable. He was even able to kill Youngflame Nong, and in
particular was also able to kill that Primal-level Fiendgod under
Youngflame Nong’s command. This makes my hands itch. Today, fellow
Daoist Ji Ning and I will merely spar with each other; if one party
is unable to keep fighting, then we can just simply admit defeat. We
absolutely won’t harm the friendship between us. Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, what say you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. Why
did the man suddenly want to spar with him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was Ning
who killed the Hydraga Fiendgod, that creature was a Primal-level
Fiendgod with the power of a supreme Loose Immortal; anyone with half
a brain would understand that Ning must have used some sort of
special method to kill it. Otherwise, just by relying on his own true
power, how could he have done so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaolou, Songspear, and
Fairy Wavecolor just watched, waiting to see Ning’s reaction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang, upon hearing
this, became all the more convinced that Ning had no ability, which
was why Ning had no confidence in fighting him. Ning was, after all,
just thirty years old.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just a spar,
not a life-and-death battle,” Xiao Lang said unhappily. “Fellow
Daoist Ji Ning, your fame is widespread. You even killed a
Primal-level Fiendgod; why don’t you dare spar against me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was luck that
allowed me to kill that Primal-level Fiendgod, not my own true
power,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang secretly
snickered. Everyone knew that there was no way Ning could’ve done
it through his own power! But today, so long as Ning could be
convinced to spar, he was going to make Ning look like a fool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are all going to
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. By then,
life-and-death battles will come in a steady stream. Today is just
sparring; if you don’t even dare to spar, how can you participate
in the Conclave?” Xiao Lang intentionally put on an angry,
unsatisfied appearance. “Are you actually afraid, fellow Daoist Ji
Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. Why was
this Xiao Lang trying to force him into this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to
spar.” Ning shook his head. “If fellow Daoist Xiao Lang truly
wishes to fight me, once the Conclave of Immortal Destiny begins, we
can fight then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Conclave of Immortal
Destiny? That’s more than a year from now! And those battles are
all life-and-death battles. If you don’t even dare spar, how…”
Xiao Lang laughed coldly, a look of disdain already on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” Kindwater
Xiaolou frowned and spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang nodded. “I
won’t force fellow Daoist Ji Ning. Since fellow Daoist Ji Ning
won’t spar, then forget it. Fellow Daoist Wavecolor, how about we
two spar for fun?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Wavecolor frowned
slightly, but then she laughed and said, “Then I’ll ask you, Xiao
Lang, to show mercy in our fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, I
won’t hurt you,” Xiao Lang said. “I’ll stop after knocking
your magic treasures away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused anger to
appear in Fairy Wavecolor’s heart. It was just as the stories said;
this Xiao Lang truly did have a bizarre disposition. He was so
arrogant in his speech.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s do it.”
Fairy Wavecolor immediately flew towards the center of the arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Xiao
Lang’s body blurred, then he appeared within the arena as well. As
for the dancing women that had been in the arena, they all quickly
fled and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there, looking
at the arena and at Xiao Lang and Fairy Wavecolor. He frowned to
himself. “This Xiao Lang really thinks he is invincible. I’ve
just arrived at the imperial capital; the Youngflame clan is
definitely scheming to act against me, so I need to be vigilant for a
period of time. This Xiao Lang might be secretly working for the
Youngflame clan, and might throw out some terrifyingly powerful magic
treasures at me, such as that ‘Lock’ scroll, at which point I
might suffer a tremendous loss. Although I have a Primaltwin, my true
body is still more important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, the usage of Dao-seals and certain other magic
treasures was forbidden. One had to rely on one’s own true power;
only in such a way could geniuses be chosen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in a spar in the
Cloudwater Manor, if Xiao Lang truly had been sent by the Youngflame
clan, if he were to suddenly produce a terrifying, bizarre treasure
and destroy Ning’s true body…that’d be a completely unfair
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Kindwater
Xiaolou was actually able to bring even a person of such a
disposition into his estate…” Ning gave a glance to the nearby
Xiaolou. Xiaolou continued to smile as he watched the arena.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaolou knew exactly
what sort of a weird, twisted personality Xiao Lang had. But even if
Xiao Lang was a rabid dog, so long as he obeyed orders, he would
still be very useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, there were
things that he couldn’t do that a rabid dog could.

Chapter 27 - Assassination
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the central
arena. The grand sealing formation now covered this region, and a
violet-robed Xiao Lang and a red-robed Fairy Wavecolor were staring
at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Fairy
Wavecolor, if you aren’t able to withstand my attacks, then hurry
up and admit defeat.” Xiao Lang laughed in a ratherly sickly
fashion. And then, following his laughter, his skin turned completely
red, as though a river of lava was flowing beneath his skin. His eyes
also turned the color of fire as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He lifted his hands
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Instantly,
petals of fire began to emerge around him, each of them blazing with
the stench of blood. At the same time, the arena seemed to instantly
become transformed into a world of fire. Although the flames just
hovered there in the air, it caused the insides of the grand sealing
formation to become extremely hot, and even the air in the arena
began to shimmer in a twisted manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Fairy
Wavecolor let out a cold snort. Whoosh. A jade-green ribbon suddenly
howled through the air. This jade-green ribbon swirled out in
circles, instantly and completely guarding an area of tens of meters
around Fairy Wavecolor’s body. At the same time, it caused a
seemingly limitless amount of watery mist to emerge, and the region
around her seemed to become a world of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around Xiao Lang, the
temperature was extremely high. Around Fairy Wavecolor, however, was
a world of watery fog and mist. The fire and the water began to clash
against each other, and crackling sounds could be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your alluring charms
are useless against me.” Xiao Lang emitted a shrill screech, and
his fiery, lava-like eyes became even more savage. “Have a taste of
my bloodflame earthfire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he let out the
screech, Xiao Lang suddenly opened his mouth. Whoosh! Instantly,
flames that reeked of blood billowed out, instantly filling the
region. The petals of fire that were hovering in the area around him,
under the guidance of the earthfire, actually formed into an enormous
formation, transforming into a an enormous midair millstone formed
from bloodflame earthfire that slowly swiveled, grinding downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish…the jade-green
ribbon continued to swim about in circles, and the runes on it began
to glow, with undulating ripples rising up then snapping back down
like bubbles. The ribbon was incomparably flexible and resilient, and
it was able to forcibly resist the bloodflame earthfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation,
Ji Ning and the others focused their attentions as they watched.
Kindwater Xiaolou said, “Xiao Lang’s ‘bloodflame earthfire’
has already reached the first grade. When forged into this ‘Bloodfire
Millstone’ technique, it is quite formidable. Ordinary Primal
Daoists aren’t able to withstand the crushing pressure of the
Bloodfire Millstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Skyfarmer
Songspear laughed, “Fairy Wavecolor perfectly counters him; her
‘Skywater Net Formation’ is perfect and legendary for defense. To
break through it is actually an incredibly hard feat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Wavecolor has
fairly few techniques.” Xiaolou shook his head. “She generally
uses her Skywater Net Formation to protect herself, then relies on
her divine will and her charming abilities…and she has indeed
reached a formidable level in them. But Xiao Lang is a madman; it’s
simply too hard to mesmerize him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from her
charming techniques, Fairy Wavecolor is skilled in other divine will
techniques as well. So long as Xiao Lang succumbs to one of them, she
will immediately be able to switch from defending to attacking!”
Songspear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, curious, just
listened. The report from the Heavenly Treasures Mountain only had
cursory explanations; how could they be as well-informed as Songspear
and Xiaolou regarding their own friends?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You crazy
bitch…argh!!!!” Xiao Lang pressed a hand against his head,
howling savagely. As for Fairy Wavecolor, she just laughed coldly.
Those ribbons that had been circling around her suddenly expanded
dramatically, and at the same time, one drop after another of
incomparably dense and heavy water, each one having the weight of a
mountain, came smashing towards Xiao Lang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graaaaaaaah!” Xiao
Long howled shrilly, and then he suddenly grew out four more arms,
and two more heads emerged from his shoulders as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three Heads, Six
Arms!]
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of Xiao Lang’s
six arms clenched a long black awl in them, and with the shrill howl,
the long black awls transformed into a rainbow streak of light as it
struck straight towards Fairy Wavecolor, carrying the limitless force
of the bloodflame earthfire with it. Every single one of those six
long black shuttles were capable of causing the colors of the world
to change, and gave off the strange feeling of being able to puncture
a hole through reality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Xiao Lang, with three heads and six arms, attacked wildly as the
surrounding area once more manifested the millstone of bloodflame
earthfire, which crushed down towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.” Fairy
Wavecolor struggled to execute her divine will technique once more.
She was skilled in three mighty divine will techniques; one was a
charm, one was for ambushing, and one was for forceful assault. She
had trained all three to an extremely high level, and by relying on
her powerful soul as a reincarnated Immortal, she was extremely
powerful when using them. She had, indeed, gained quite a bit of
fame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if, however, an
opponent was able to resist her secret arts, then her chances for
victory would be much lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. With the support
of the millstone of bloodflame earthfire, the three-headed, six-armed
Xiao Lang attacked with incomparable savagery, forcibly breaking
through one layer of the defense of the jade-green ribbon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.”
An unhappy voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Xiao Lang
stay his hand, dismissing his bloodflame earthfire and his divine
ability. He laughed wildly, and his body continued to emit a
scorching heat. “Fairy Wavecolor, I told you that you’d lose.
That divine will technique of yours? Bahaha, you want to shake my
soul? In your dreams.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand sealing
formation disappeared. Fairy Wavecolor, with a cold face, flew back
to her own position, not even bothering to look at Xiao Lang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, wanna
spar?” Xiao Lang gave Ning a glance, appearing quite smug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need,” Ning
said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Xiao Lang
flew straight back to his own seat, clearly quite delighted with
himself. Generally speaking, madmen with twisted personalities
actually had extremely tough Dao-hearts. Xiao Lang was one such
twisted madman. He was the sort who would never bow his head, even in
the face of death; he’d remain as arrogant and unbridled as ever.
Although he had offended quite a few people, he remained true to his
own personality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…he also knew
who he couldn’t afford to offend. For example, he never tried to
set himself up against Kindwater Xiaolou.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudwater Manor. In
the air above the long passageway that led to the place where Ji Ning
currently was, a bald old man suddenly appeared. It was Immortal
Floatcloud, who had changed his appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Immortal
Floatcloud walked through the midair corridor, no thoughts in his
mind save one - to kill Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he saw Ji Ning
lead a group of Golden Imperials to Cloudwater Manor, Immortal
Floatcloud understood that he would have no other opportunities. In
King Yan’s Estate, there was no way to kill Ji Ning at all. When
leading a group of Golden Imperials on his flying ship, Immortal
Floatcloud still didn’t have even the slightest hint of a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right now, Ning was
chatting and merrymaking with others, and his servants and guards
were all stationed somewhere else. This…this actually gave Immortal
Floatcloud his one and only chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Cloudwater
Manor definitely had experts guarding it, as well as layers of
protective formations and spells, as far as Immortal Floatcloud was
concerned, this was going to be the best chance he had. If he
continued to hesitate, then by the time Ning returned to King Yan’s
Estate and rested for a day without leaving, he, Immortal Floatcloud,
would have his soul devoured and shattered due to his oath to the Dao
of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my final
chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Either you
die, or I die.” Immortal Floatcloud walked on the levitating
pathway, moving straight towards main door towards that three
thousand meter tall building.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two Wanxiang
Adepts standing guard at the door; they were here to prevent others
from disturbing the people inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” One of the
guards immediately spoke out. “What are you doing here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The noise-cancellation
features of the Cloudwater Manor’s buildings were simply too good;
there was no way for the people inside to hear the noises coming from
outside. Ning and the others continued to eat, drink, chat, and
laugh. They weren’t on guard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I came to meet young
master Kindwater,” Immortal Floatcloud said. As his words rang out,
the two Wanxiang guards suddenly felt their souls grow dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in that instant
that their souls were stunned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud,
with a single step, appeared before the door, then pushed it open and
charged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The door
immediately swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Fairy
Wavecolor, I don’t want to criticize you, but your weakness is way
too obvious. If your divine will technique is useless, then you are
guaranteed to lose.” Xiao Lang, who had just won, was incomparably
smug right now. “And Ji Ning. Hey, Ji Ning, you’ve only trained
for thirty years; I recommend that you don’t go embarrass yourself
in the Conclave of Immortal destiny. Train for another three
centuries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” Xiaolou
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And just as Xiaolou
spoke out…the door suddenly opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Xiaolou,
Songspear, Ning, and the others all turned their heads to look.
Because the building in which they were having their banquet was
three thousand meters high, the servants who brought in food and
wine, as well as the dancers and musicians, would all come in through
another corridor. And when they did, they would all be completely
silent. Very few would just push the main door open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud,
after pushing the door open, took a single step and appeared directly
in front of Ning. At the same time, a white bone needle suddenly
appeared in his hand, and he sent it flying forward, straight towards
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding world
instantly froze! A powerful, deathly aura emanated outwards as the
white bone needle, carrying an infinitely terrifying aura, pierced
straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitebone Immortal
Slayer Needle!” Xiaolou, Songspear, Ning, Fairy Wavecolor, and the
smug Xiao Lang all had the looks on their faces completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant…all
of them felt cold fear. They all knew how terrifying the Whitebone
Immortal Slayer Needles were…and they all watched as one of them
flew straight towards Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be a
Deathsworn the Youngflame clan has sent over…and it is a Loose
Immortal Deathsworn at that. Only an Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal
can activate this Whitebone Immortal Slayer Needle.” Xiaolou
immediately shattered a Dao-seal, and a stream of jade water
immediately began to glow as it flowed over his body. “With the
emergence of this needle…even though Ji Ning is a Fiendgod Body
Refiner, even his soul will probably be destroyed, to say nothing of
his Fiendgod body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dead. He’s
dead for certain. That’s a Whitebone Immortal Slayer Needle; it’s
a killing technique against even many Loose Immortals. Many Loose
Immortals would perish to it; only a few, extremely powerful Loose
Immortals would be able to block it, but they would still be injured.
Ji Ning is absolutely dead.” Xiao Lang was actually delighting in
Ning’s misfortune; he, too, could guess that this was a Deathsworn
from the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant,
Xiaolou, Songspear, Fairy Wavecolor, and Xiao Lang were all certain
that Ning was most likely going to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Golden
Imperials which Ning had brought with him, they were shocked as well.
“Protect the young master!” The problem was, it would take the
fifty Golden Imperials a little bit of time to assemble into a
Dao-soldier formation, then hurry over to save Ning. But…how fast
was the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle flying? There was no time
for them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one could save Ning.
Everything relied on Ning himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame
clan.” Ning instantly understood, and he immediately unleashed his
divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body instantly
exploded forth with divine power, becoming incomparably tall and
muscular. Lightning began to crackle on his body as he seemed to
transform into an enormous vajra. At the same time, four more arms
grew out from his body, and two more heads emerged from his
shoulders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three Heads, Six
Arms]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms
wielded the three Darknorth swords and three Heaven-ranked flying
swords. These three were all top-grade magic treasures left behind by
Immortal Juhua which he personally used for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
Thanks to the treasures which Youngflame Nong had left behind, Ning’s
earthfire and dire-ice had both reached the second grade already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous Waterflame
Lotus appeared, swiveling around this three-headed, six-armed
Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms
exploded with awe-inspiring power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Dao Domain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ji Ning, wielding six enormous Immortal swords, crackled
with electricity. His aura filled the heavens, and a Waterflame Lotus
swiveled around him. At the same time, the entirety of the building
became instantly transformed into a world of sword-ki. The limitless
field of sword-ki instantly filled the entire building, and sword-ki
was stabbing everywhere. The six enormous swords in Ning’s hands
began to glow with an incomparably dazzling golden metallic light, a
light that was so strong that it was all but in material form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block.” The
three-headed, six-armed Ning used all six swords to simultaneously
block towards the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 28 - Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was slow
to describe, in reality it happened in an instant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the
lightning-fast Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle, Ji Ning didn’t
even have time to make his Primaltwin emerge to block. After all,
although he could indeed make his Primaltwin emerge from the
underwater estate extremely quickly, it would still need to unleash
the hundreds of Heaven-ranked flying swords and execute the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]. All these things took time! The Whitebone
Immortal Slaying Needle, however, gave Ning no such time at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only had enough
time to immediately activate his divine abilities, then block!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Waterflame
Lotus surrounding Ning was incomparably resilient, it was still
instantly penetrated through!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ji Ning held his Immortal swords in his hands, unleashing
his most powerful attacks to block the Whitebone Immortal Slaying
Needle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!
CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six consecutive and
incomparably ferocious collisions. Of the six swords, three were
Darknorth swords and thus possessed tremendous power. As for the
other three Heaven-ranked swords, although Ning’s true body
couldn’t fill them with his elemental ki, as Heaven-ranked
artifacts, they were still quite tough and strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had used
Earth-ranked flying swords, the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needles
probably would’ve pierced straight through them. These three
Heaven-ranked flying swords Immortal Juhua had left behind wouldn’t
shatter, at least! They would at least allow Ning to unleash the full
power of his [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each collision was like
an enormous mountain range smashing towards Ning. Six consecutive
collisions! Fortunately, Ning’s palms had been strengthened by the
[Six Cycles of the Starseizer] to be even more powerful than
Heaven-ranked magic treasures. That’s the only reason why he was
able to hold the hilts of the swords securely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the six
sword-wielding ars all executed the [Starseizing Hand] and strove to
block the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needles, Ning himself was
knocked flying back by the terrifying collisive force. He shot out
backwards like a meteor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block, block,
BLOCK!” Ning strove his utmost to block for as long as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had
already trained to the eleventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens] as a Fiendgod Body Refiner and was nominally
only at the peak Wanxiang Adept level, because Ning had acquired the
peacock plumes and trained to the second Cycle of the [Six Cycles of
the Starseizer], his [Starseizing Hand] technique was now capable of
exploding with incomparably terrifying force. This caused Ning’s
power to instantly surpass the Primal stage and charge all the way
into the Void-level Earth Immortal stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the additional
support of his current Grand Dao Domain, his nearly perfect Dao of
Rainwater, and the fact that Sword Immortals were extremely skilled
in attacks….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!! Ning’s
towering Fiendgod body struck heavily against a wooden pillar. This
wooden pillar, however, was covered by the restrictive spells which
stretched across the entire Cloudwater Manor. It was extremely
stable, and it wasn’t damaged in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Ning spat
out a mouthful of fresh blood. His physical body actually was already
covered with all sorts of scars and wounds by now, and blood was
oozing out from them. The collisive forces had been far, far too
powerful. Although Ning had executed [Heavenly Transformations] and
[Pentabolt Vajra] to stabilize and bolster his divine body, his body
was still vastly inferior to his two hands. The force of the
collisions caused his flesh to split open into countless wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t die.”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had gone all out to
block the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle, and as he had continued
to block, the power of the needle had continuously been whittled
away. In the end, as it smashed down against the final sword, it had
caused the sword to slash across Ning’s chest. The force of that
final collision had nearly caused Ning’s body to implode…but in
the end, although countless tears and rips appeared on his body, he
didn’t truly perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I blocked it.”
Ning mentally began to celebrate wildly. “Fortunately, I trained in
the second Cycle of the [Six Cycles of the Starseizer]. And
fortunately, during this past year, I’ve begun to train in the
[Three Heads, Six Arms] ability. This allowed all six of my arms to
execute the [Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crimsonbright divine
energy began to flow over the countless wounds covering his body, and
the divine energy quickly began to cause the wounds to heal and
close. Ning’s six arms continued to each grasp an Immortal sword.
The sword-light unique to Sword Immortals filled the skies. Sword-ki
filled the entire area with their awe-inspiring might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was knocked
flying backwards, Immortal Floatcloud had charged forward as well.
Although he was amazed by the fact that Ning had managed to block it,
he didn’t pause or hesitate at all! This was because he had sworn
an oath to the Dao of the Heavens for this assassination. If Ning
didn’t die, then his soul would be shattered. Thus, his reaction
came quite quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! As he charged
straight towards Ning, Immortal Floatcloud waved his arm. Instantly,
a golden heart appeared in midair. The golden heart immediately began
to manifest thousands of veins and arteries, forming an enormous net
that completely covered the empty central region they were in. This
enormous net formed from countless blood vessels glowed with a bloody
light, and an aura of power emanated from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
assassinating Ning, Immortal Floatcloud had prepared two magic items.
The first was the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle. It possessed
astonishing power, and Immortal Floatcloud believed that even he
would be heavily injured upon being assaulted by it. Ji Ning?
Ordinary protective items would be immediately shattered by it; Ji
Ning would almost assuredly perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other item was
this, the ‘Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation’. Once the formation
was set down, it would take a good amount of time for either the
Imperial Guard or the Loose Immortals on guard here to charge through
it. As long as he had enough time, he would be able to kill Ji Ning
in a one-on-one fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a supreme Loose
Immortal! Ji Ning was merely a Wanxiang Adept! Even though the
Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle had been blocked by some strange
magic treasures, in a true one-on-one fight, if he had enough time,
he refused to believe Ji Ning could withstand him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both treasures were
single-use items. Although he had paid a high price of many magic
treasures, in truth, the Youngflame clan had essentially ‘gifted’
these two items to Immortal Floatcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudwater Manor was
the largest, most important trading ground for the Kindwater clan in
the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were thirty-six
Loose Immortals permanently stationed here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Kindwater clan had
thousands of Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals. For only thirty-six
to be stationed here…on the surface, the numbered seemed to be
quite low. In truth, however, these thirty-six Loose Immortals…were
all dressed in Immortal-ranked Dao-soldier armors. Once they all
joined forces, they could even force a Celestial Immortal to retreat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earth character,
second number. There’s an assassination attempt there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the thirty-six
Loose Immortals were in private training, while others were drinking
and carousing. However, upon the Primal Daoist overseeing Cloudwater
Manor sending them mental messages, they all instantly arrived in the
air above Cloudwater Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty six of them in
total! They were all dressed in black Dao-armors, and they each
emanated with terrifying auras that filled the heavens. They hung
there in midair for a moment, then suddenly all thirty-six of them
joined together to transform into an enormous black serpent. As soon
as it appeared in the skies, a stream of water appeared. The
surrounding space was completely frozen. The giant black serpent
immediately charged towards the three-thousand meter tall building
where Ning and the others were currently located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous ceiling,
under the control of the overseer of Cloudwater Manor, split open,
allowing the giant black serpent to immediately charge in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this took time
to describe, in truth, the thirty-six Loose Immortals were incredibly
fast. And yet, despite their speed, by the time they arrived, the
Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation had already completely covered Ning’s
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s dead for
sure.” Xiao Lang stared at the area covered by the massive net of
blood vessels. “This is the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation. It can
only be acquired at a cost of half a million kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence, and it can only be used once. Although it can only
be used once…it has truly astonishing power. Even if the Imperial
Guard of the Grand Xia were to arrive, it would take them some time
to break through it. Although Cloudwater Manor is guarded by experts
of the Kindwater clan, I imagine it will take them time to break
through as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfarmer Songspear,
Kindwater Xiaolou, and Fairy Wavecolor were all in a stunned state as
well as they all sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they
were stunned…was because they all saw how just now, Ning had
instantly exploded with terrifying power. All of those divine
abilities aside, Ning had demonstrated a Grand Dao Domain, and it had
even had the resilience and elasticity of water. Ning’s sword-light
had flowed in a steady, unbreakable stream as his six Immortal swords
had blocked the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle! Clearly, Ning was
incredibly powerful in terms of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just by virtue of
the fact that he has comprehended a Grand Dao Domain, this Ji Ning
has vastly surpassed all of those geniuses who have only mastered a
single Dao-Path. Xiao Lang, Fairy Wavecolor…they are vastly
inferior to Ji Ning.” Xiaolou secretly sighed to himself. “And he
was actually able to survive under the assault of the Whitebone
Immortal Slaying Needle. Clearly, in that instant when he unleashed
his full power, he reached the level of a Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who dared to
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny were generally
geniuses at the peak Wanxiang Adept level who were capable of
exploding forth with the power of a peak Primal Daoist! Only a small
number were able to reach the combat power of a Loose Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortals had
tremendously varying levels of power as well. Void-level Earth
Immortals, for example, were also divided into early, middle, late,
and peak stages. Because of different levels of insight into the Dao,
Immortals had tremendously different levels of power as well. Even
those most supreme of Wanxiang Adept geniuses were only comparable to
ordinary Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But even amongst
supreme geniuses, there were still differences; Ning, because of his
[Starseizing Hand], could be considered an ordinary Void-level Earth
Immortal, but with the powerful life-force of his Fiendgod body, and
the added support of the [Three Heads, Six Arms] ability giving him
six arms that could use the [Starseizing Hand], Ning was able to stay
alive against the assault of even a Whitebone Immortal Slaying
Needle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity.”
Songspear secretly sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a genius. And
he’s only trained for thirty years?” Fairy Wavecolor secretly
sighed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already so
strong at thirty years of age. He is indeed much stronger than me.
Buuut, he’s gonna die soon.” Xiao Lang stared fixedly at the
grand formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The squad of Golden
Imperials instantly transformed into a divine golden dragon,
battering and smashing towards the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousands of blood
vessels covering the formation just bulged slightly, then easily
deflected the force of the attack. The golden heart was pumping blood
in an endless stream to them, causing the grand formation to remain
standing. Only the blood was used up would the formation dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The
thirty-six Loose Immortals in the form of a giant black serpent flew
in from above. With power that was tens of times more powerful than
the divine golden dragon, they launched an awe-inspiring strike
against the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation trembled,
and many of the blood vessels actually splintered and shattered. The
golden heart, however, frantically sent out more blood, causing many
new blood vessels to be grown out, allowing the formation to be
sustained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can save you
now.” Immortal Floatcloud was within the formation. In front of
him, three flying swords had appeared, forming into a
formation-diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, who had
been smashed against the wooden pillar…he laughed coldly.
“Youngflame clan, right?” Next to him, a black-robed youth
suddenly appeared. This black-robed youth looked identical to him,
and as it appeared, more than two hundred flying swords appeared
around him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
suddenly vanished from sight. He had entered the underwater estate.
After all, during the previous exchange, Ning’s true body had been
heavily wounded and needed to recuperate. His divine power had been
almost used up, with only 20% remaining; he didn’t have enough to
continue fighting against this Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the nine precious
Waterbreaker Godshark Swords serving as the core, the other 200+
Heaven-ranked flying swords were all activated, causing the insides
of the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation to be filled with an endless
amount of sword-ki. This sword-ki…was tens of times more powerful
than the sword-ki Ning’s true body had shown earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primaltwin?”
Immortal Floatcloud’s eyes instantly turned huge. He stared at the
three Heaven-ranked flying swords in front of him, then at the 200+
Heaven-ranked flying swords hovering in front of the distant,
black-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WHAT?!” Outside
the formation. Songspear, Xiaolou, and Fairy Wavecolor, who had been
feeling pity for Ji Ning, were all flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But,
but…IMPOSSIBLE!” Xiao Lang, who had been smirking coldly as he
watched Ning ‘go to his death’, actually called out in shock.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_29___Primaltwin_vs_Loose"></A>
Chapter 29 - Primaltwin vs Loose Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji Ning
stood there, more than two hundred Heaven-ranked flying swords
floating around him. The amount of sword-ki filling the region inside
the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation was simply astonishing and
heart-shaking. Anyone could tell what terrifying power this
black-robed Ning possessed. And, given that Ning’s true body had
suddenly vanished, everyone present could guess…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That this black-robed
Ning was a Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a
Primaltwin. How…but…Ji Ning’s only trained for thirty years…”
A look of shock and anger was in Xiao Lang’s eyes, along with
disbelief. “He’s only trained for thirty years! How can he have a
Primaltwin? He dared to split his soul in half? Isn’t he afraid of
death?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
Primaltwin. All of those two hundred-plus flying swords seem to be
Heaven-ranked. I heard that this Ji Ning purchased hundreds of
high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords from the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain; so it was for the sake of giving them to his Primaltwin for
use. This Ji Ning is exceptionally wealthy; his Primaltwin has
probably trained all the way up to the peak Primal level at one go.”
Kindwater Xiaolou secretly sighed in amazement. “To be able to
simultaneously control more than two hundred Heaven-ranked magic
treasures…he absolutely has a peak Loose Immortal’s power. His
true body has vanished; it should’ve entered an estate that he
carries with him. Mobile estates are exceptionally valuable. How much
money does this Ji Ning have? Can it be that he gained an enormous
sum from the Witchriver Immortal Estate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Youngflame
Nong had an estate that he could carry around with him…but Ji Ning
did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaolou believed that
Ning must have acquired it from the Witchriver Immortal Estate. He
had no idea that this Immortal estate which Ning was carrying with
him had been gifted to Ning by the giant yellow bear, the spirit of
the underwater estate, for free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
Skyfarmer Songspear stared at the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power…and
yet, when Xiao Lang challenged him in such an insulting manner, he
didn’t pay him any heed. He truly has tremendous restraint.”
Fairy Wavecolor sighed in amazement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could all guess
that Ning’s true body was now hidden within the estate he carried
with him. Mobile estates could indeed hold people…but no matter
what, either Ning’s true body or his Primaltwin had to be in the
outside, real world. If both hid inside, then the mobile estate would
be forced to reveal itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
mobile estates weren’t too strong in terms of resisting attacks.
Enemies could forcibly take it over, then toss it into the voids of
the Three Realms, at which point the person inside would be doomed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Witchriver Immortal
Estate, for example, was immobile and couldn’t be carried away.
That was why it was able to be used as a headquarters and why it had
such strong defenses. Estates that one could carry, however, were
generally very weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One had to choose
between strong defenses and mobility. Generally speaking, one could
only choose a single quality from the two. Except, of course, for the
likes of the ‘underwater estate’. Daoist Threelives, one of the
primordial Fiengods who had been born before the universe had been
established, had used all of his effort to craft it for his heirs.
Only at the Primal level could it be carried, and it was exceedingly
strong in defense. However, the value of such a treasure far
surpassed even Pure Yang magic treasures; this was why it was so
special.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normal estates,
however, had to obey the normal rules. Mobility or defensive
strength; the two couldn’t co-exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my true body and
Primaltwin both hide within the underwater estate, then under the
wild attacks of this Loose Immortal of the Youngflame clan, the
secrets of my underwater estate will probably be revealed.” Ning
absolutely would not permit this to happen. “What’s more, my
Primaltwin has already reached the peak Primal level. Although in
terms of a base of power, he’s on a much lower level…that’s not
insurmountable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s actually a
Primaltwin. Patriarch Arcanum, you screwed me over!” Immortal
Floatcloud was howling with grief in his mind…and then, a look of
savagery filled his eyes. “I have no way out. Either Ji Ning dies
or I die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
that I, who have trained bitterly for more than a hundred thousand
years, can’t do anything to this little fellow who trained for
thirty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These thoughts flashed
through his mind lightning-fast. After Immortal Floatcloud had laid
down his Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation and saw Ning’s Primaltwin,
he spent just a brief moment in shock before executing his most
powerful attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HEAVEN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EARTH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“MORTAL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
bellowed, his entire face instantly turning completely red. Ignoring
all consequences, he immediately used a forbidden technique. Within
the core of his body, a golden lotus Primal exploded forth with even
more elemental ki. The auras of those three flying swords in front of
him which vaguely formed into a sword-diagram formation suddenly
increased dramatically, and the formation-diagram seemed to truly
materialize. The enormous formation-diagram seemed capable of
swallowing the universe. It was incomparably vast, and clouds and fog
appeared within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!!!” Immortal
Floatcloud immediately used his most powerful killing technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no time to
waste. The thirty-six Loose Immortals of the Kindwater clan who were
outside were joining forces to wildly assault his Bloodcoil
Heavenlock Formation. Once the formation was broken through, then in
the face of those thirty-six Loose Immortals who were dressed in
Immortal-ranked Dao-armors, he probably would be finished in a single
exchange. Naturally, he had to seize the moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heaven, Earth, Mortal.
The three top-grade flying swords, surrounded by the spinning
formation-diagram, seemed to carry the majesty of the world itself as
it came crashing downwards towards Ning. This was using raw force to
suppress the foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The distant
black-robed Ning, faced with this attack, didn’t move slower than
Immortal Floatcloud at all. He also immediately executed the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]. Under the guidance of those nine
Waterbreaker Godshark Swords, the power of the two hundred-plus
Heaven-ranked flying swords was joined together by the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], forming in front of Ning a flying sword
that was surrounded by an aura of golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
elemental ki, I’m a major level below him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in terms of the
Dao…I’ve comprehended the Grand Dao Domain of the Dao of the
Sword, and I’ve mastered the Dao-Path of Rainwater. The two have
been fused into one, and Sword Immortals specialize in attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of
treasures and formations, I have the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]; that Heaven-Earth-Mortal formation clearly isn’t all
that exquisite. This technique of mine belonged to the Thousand
Swords Immortal, a major foe of Immortal Juhua who Immortal Juhua had
never been able to forget. Even the spirit of the underwater estate
praised this technique. And, for the Youngflame clan to send you as a
Deathsworn means that your status amongst the Loose Immortals of the
Youngflame clan probably wasn’t that high either. You are vastly
inferior to the Thousand Swords Immortal and Immortal Juhua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of flying
swords…the Wavebreaker Godshark Swords come from the underwater
estate, and are vastly superior to your three flying swords. In
addition, I have nine of them. In terms of raw numbers, I have more
than two hundred flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
I can’t win!” A cold light flashed through the eyes of the
black-robed Ning, and his savage aura filled the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was dressed in
black robes, the other in white. They stared at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three flying
swords, carrying the enormous formation-diagram with them, came
crashing downwards. As for that flying sword wreathed in golden light
in front of Ning, it instantly pierced through the skies, carrying a
sharp sheen that caused one’s heart to tremble. It clashed directly
against the enormous formation-diagram ahead of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous rumbling
sound of a collision. Elemental ki exploded, causing space to
distort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three flying swords
were actually forced backwards by several meters, and many cracks had
appeared atop the foggy formation-diagram. As for Ning’s flying
sword, it dispersed into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” The
black-robed Ning laughed coldly, and the two hundred-plus flying
swords around him undulated once more. A large amount of sword-ki
coalesced in front of his chest, forming yet another flying sword
that was covered with a golden glow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be? He
blocked…blocked it!?” Immortal Floatcloud felt his heart grow
cold. It was as though he was beneath the moon in a freezing winter
night, and someone had just poured a bucket of ice water over his
head. Even his soul felt cold. He had a feeling…that he was going
to lose. He had executed a forbidden technique to unleash his most
powerful killing attack, but his attack had actually been met head-on
and blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A head-on collision was
the most effective way to judge the opponent’s strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Primaltwin has
the power of a supreme Loose Immortal in combat.” Immortal
Floatcloud now understood. “This…this is a true genius. His
Primaltwin is probably only at the peak Primal level, and he has only
trained for thirty years…but he’s comprehended a Grand Dao
Domain. His insights are not inferior to mine, and the power of that
grand flying sword formation is simply marvelous and unfathomable.
His power is no lower than mine either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that I,
Floatcloud, am going to die here?” Immortal Floatcloud felt despair
for just a brief moment; he wouldn’t so easily discard more than a
hundred thousand years of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I failed to crush
him with raw force…then I’ll try techniques, speed, and other
secret arts.” Immortal Floatcloud had gone completely mad. He was
using all of his power to struggle to kill Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire region
within the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation became filled with white
fog. The fog was incomparably thick, so thick that not even divine
sense could penetrate eit. This was Immortal Floatcloud’s most
powerful supportive art, the ‘Heaven-Covering Fog’. However,
executing this secret art consumed an enormous amount of his mental
energy, and he was no longer able to keep his flying swords at peak
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t see
anything.” Xiao Lang, who had been staring so hard and fixedly that
his eyes had gone bloodshot, instantly grew frantic. “Why is there
so much fog there? I can’t see anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fog? This fog is
definitely capable of blocking out divine sense; otherwise, that
Deathsworn wouldn’t use it..” Kindwater Xiaolou was pondering.
“Of the many Loose Immortals of the Youngflame clan, there should
be a few dozen that are close to the point of being unable to resist
the Three Calamities or Nine Tribulations. Those amongst them that
are capable of unleashing this sort of mist…it seems the only one
is Loose Immortal Floatcloud?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs were truly ageless; they would only ever die in combat.
Thus, they generally would live extremely long lives and experience
countless things. It was thus quite hard for anyone to know for
certain how many of the Celestial Immortals of a particular clan
remained alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loose Immortals,
however, were different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was incredible for a
Loose Immortal to live even a few million years, such as Immortal
Juhua. This was why the Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals of every
tribe could generally be located and verified. The Kindwater clan, at
least, was quite familiar regarding the statuses of the vast majority
of Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals of their mortal enemy, the
Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning is so
formidable. His Primaltwin definitely has the power of a supreme
Loose Immortal…and he’s also a Sword Immortal. In a head-on
clash, he was no weaker than that Loose Immortal Deathsworn.”
Songspear mused to himself, “But with this bewildering fog
unleashed, Ji Ning can’t see anything at all…he’s now in a bit
of danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six Loose
Immortals, in the shape of that giant black serpent, were absolutely
as powerful as a Celestial Immortal. They once more charged towards
the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation. They had smashed against it eight
times now, and they had shattered countless blood vessels of the
formation. However, that golden heart continued to frantically spew
out even more blood, forming more arteries and veins as it strove to
support and maintain this formation. Still, one could tell that scars
were beginning to appear on the surface of the golden heart. Clearly,
the attack of the thirty-six Loose Immortals was simply too strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
formation. Fog was everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Dao Domain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Own World!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stood there. Faced with this divine sense smothering technique, he
finally unleashed the protective technique which he had developed
during this past year within the underwater estate. It must be
understood that Ki Refiners had very weak bodies; thus, they usually
researched protective techniques that would prevent the opponent from
easily reaching their flesh. Ji Ning naturally had to consider the
best way to protect his Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the guidance of
the spirit of the underwater estate, Ning had used his Grand Dao
Domain, his Waterflame Lotus, and the ‘My Own World’ technique 1
to serve as the foundation for the development of a powerful
protective technique.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six Loose
Immortals of the Kindwater clan, in the form of the giant black
serpent, launched a twelfth attack against the Bloodcoil Heavenlock
Formation. It was already beginning to shudder, and the color of the
golden heart was beginning to change. Beginning to grow dim, as the
cracks and scars on its surface multiplied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break, break,
break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud was
in a berserk state, his white hair flying about. His three flying
swords clashed hard against Ning’s Lotusflower Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Layers of lotus petals
continuously defended, one layer after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]-formed golden flying sword was as fast as
lightning. By comparison, the speed of the flying swords of Immortal
Floatcloud was much lower; they were once more struck, then sent
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
suddenly gave up. His three flying swords no longer attacked. He just
stood there, staring blankly at the black-robed Ji Ning, who stood
there within the Lotusflower Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of the
Lotusflower Swordland…Immortal Floatcloud felt as though he was
facing a turtle that had retreated into its shell. There was no way
to break it at all! Or, at least, he wasn’t going to be able to do
it in a short period of time. In addition, he could sense that his
Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation was at the breaking point. He felt
despair. He gave up. He understood that this time…he had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
looked at Ning, his face incomparably calm and peaceful. He sent
mentally, “Ji Ning, tell me, what…what technique is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning,
seeing that the opponent had actually stopped attacking, realized
that the opponent had given up. Towards the bald elder in front of
him, Ning actually didn’t feel any hatred; instead, he felt pity.
This was because Ning could tell…that this person was a Deathsworn!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my
Lotusflower Swordland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single lotus
petal was formed from my elemental ki and the sword-light.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The region covered
by my lotus flowers becomes my world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a world with
the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of Rainwater, the Dao of Space, and the
Dao of the Inferno. This is the most powerful technique which I have
developed.” The black-robed Ning spoke mentally to his foe. In this
moment…Ning understood that the man had chosen death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
looked at Ning, envy in his eyes. “The Dao of the Sword? The Dao of
Space? The Dao of Rainwater? The Dao of the Inferno? So many Daos…and
two of them are Grand Daos. You’ve actually been able to join them
together perfectly and create a technique of your own. At only thirty
years of age, you are already so talented…I’ve never before met a
genius like you in my life. I can’t even imagine what your future
shall be like. I…am whole-heartedly convinced that my defeat was
deserved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, knew
exactly how much effort he had put into the creation of this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had often gone to
the Stellar Hall to meditate on the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had often gone to
the Still Room to quietly ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had repeatedly,
tirelessly tested time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spirit of the
underwater estate had guided him as well…and all of these things
had helped to inspire him, allowing him to develop this protective
technique, this technique that was completely focused on defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill me. Let me die
by your hands.” A dreamy look was in Immortal Floatcloud’s eyes.
In the moment before his death, his subconscious was telling him…that
this peerless genius in front of him, Ji Ning, would have an
astonishing future. In fact, he even had the vague feeling that an
incomparably massive storm was about to arise…and that the peerless
genius before him would become one of the most dazzling figures to
emerge from the storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you desire.”
The black-robed Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden sword-light
flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
didn’t block at all. He allowed it to slash directly through his
body, piercing into the golden-lotus Primal within his body. The
golden lotus, upon being pierced through, began to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning hadn’t
destroyed Immortal Floatcloud’s soul, because of the oath he had
sworn to the Dao of the Heavens, Immortal Floatcloud knew that his
soul was about to be shattered regardless. He knew this…because he
could sense the ripples from the impending descent of the Dao of the
Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Arcanum…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this moment, my
subconscious is telling me that an enormous tempest is about to
descend…one dazzling, eye-catching figure after another is going to
arise from the storm, and this Ji Ning is going to be one of them.
Our Youngflame clan is going to have a calamity befall us because of
this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Arcanum,
it is one thing for you to have doomed me…but how terrifying of an
enemy have you made for our Youngflame clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, you
will regret it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You will regret it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the
criminal, the sinner of our Youngflame clan. The sinner! But none of
this has anything to do with me any longer…I, whose soul is about
to shatter, no longer have any connection to anything, to anything at
all…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud
closed his eyes. His body completely dissipated into nothingness,
revealing an already battered and disintegrating golden-lotus Primal.
Under the descent of the ripples of the Dao of the Heavens, the
golden lotus was completely annihilated, quickly and completely
vaporizing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
cultivator was, the more faith they would place in what their
subsconscious told them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Floatcloud, in
the moment before his death, could also sense that in the future, a
terrifying storm was about to arise…and that even the likes of the
Youngflame clan, which had existed from the earliest days of the
Fiendgod Era until now, would be shaken and perhaps be thrown down by
the storm…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the sword-light of
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] pierced through the
golden-lotus Primal and as Immortal Floatcloud transformed into
nothingness, a massive explosion could suddenly be heard. The
Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation blew apart, and a giant black serpent
coiled in the air above it, staring down at Ji Ning, who was being
protected by a titanic, swiveling lotus flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One lotus petal swept
around and picked up the flying swords, storage treasures, and other
relics left behind by the deceased Immortal Floatcloud. This petal
then drifted over to the black-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
waved his hand, collecting it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire manor was
completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrified
servants…the stunned Golden Imperials…Skyfarmer
Songspear…Kindwater Xiaolou…Fairy Wavecolor…Xiao Lang…and
even the thirty-six Loose Immortals, who had dropped their
formation…all of them stared at the black-robed Ning, protected by
the defensive layers of the enormous Lotusflower Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had just

Chapter 31 - Fame From the Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou,
Skyfarmer Songspear, and the others were unable to even breathe. They
were all in a state of shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaolou, whose this
friend of yours?” The leader of the thirty-six Loose Immortals, a
burly and muscular bearded man, spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Fan, he is Ji
Ning. I invited him here…but who would’ve thought that he’d
suffer an attack from a Loose Immortal Deathsworn?” Xiaolou said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The
bearded, burly ‘Uncle Fan’ immediately realized who Ning was, as
did the group of Loose Immortals behind him. The death of Youngflame
Nong wasn’t something everyone knew, but most of these Loose
Immortals who were permanently stationed at Cloudwater Manor knew
about this matter. They thus immediately guessed that it had been the
Youngflame clan who had sent out the Loose Immortal Deathsworn.
Instantly, these Immortals of the Kindwater clan began to feel a
sense of delighted schadenfreude; the Kindwater clan had been mortal
enemies with the Youngflame clan for countless eons now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend Ji
Ning.” Kindwater Sanfan looked at the black-robed Ning, then said
with a loud laugh, “You truly are formidable. If my guess is
correct, this Loose Immortal should have been Immortal Floatcloud.
He’s a Loose Immortal who has lived for a hundred thousand years,
but he actually died in your hands…and your Primaltwin should be at
the peak Primal level, correct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a peak Primal to
be able to kill a supreme Loose Immortal…you clearly are a level
lower in terms of elemental ki, and you’ve only trained for thirty
years, but…formidable, formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That lotus technique
truly broadened my horizons as well, and that sword formation
technique was also quite impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of Loose
Immortals of the Kindwater clan all laughed and praised Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why they
praised him was not just because Ning truly had surprised them; more
importantly, there was a huge grudge between Ning and the Youngflame
clan! Since the Kindwater clan was mortal enemies against the
Youngflame clan, they took a true liking towards Ning. The more
impressive he was, the more of a threat he would be to the Youngflame
clan, and the more they would like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much.” The black-robed Ning shook his head. “The only reason I
won was because your combined powers, seniors, was far too strong.
You caused the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation to nearly break down.
Immortal Floatcloud knew that he had no more time left, and so he
voluntarily gave up. Only thus could I kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of power,
Ning’s Primaltwin was actually only on par with Immortal
Floatcloud. If they had been in a simple one-on-one fight, it would
be hard to say who would be the winner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this was no simple
battle; it was an assassination attempt! An assassination attempt in
the Cloudwater Manor of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia! It had
to be resolved quickly. As a Deathsworn, Immortal Floatcloud had
already been forced to the brink from the very beginning. If he
wasn’t able to kill Ning in a short moment, then he would have no
choice but to welcome death in his despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. The
Whitewater Hound and Little Qing charged over to the black-robed
Ning. Previously, the two had been seated alongside the Golden
Imperials, drinking and eating with them. When Ning suffered the
attack, not even the Golden Imperials had been able to protect him in
time, much less the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had been
frantic and nervous, and had been driven nearly to the point of
insanity. They didn’t even dare to send soul messages, for fear
that Ning would be distracted by them; after all, this was a
life-and-death battle. If Ning was distracted and something untoward
happened as a result, then it truly would be too late for regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately!
Fortunately, Ning had survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You killed him,
that’s all that matters.” Kindwater Sanfan shook his head, then
laughed, “Your Primaltwin is at the peak Primal level; it is a full
tier lower than Immortal Floatcloud in power. But in the end,
Immortal Floatcloud wasn’t able to do anything to you. There’s
nothing he can say about his loss, and your victory was a clean and
fair one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment, a
powerful aura suddenly spread out from the air above them. This
caused all the people present, including the Loose Immortals, Ning,
Xiaolou, Songspear, and the others to all raise their heads to look.
From the opened ceiling above them, a group of figures flew
downwards, with the leader dressed in black armor and the rest
dressed in silver armor. These were the Imperial Guards of the Grand
Xia!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader, a
black-armored youth, chortled, appearing to be quite relaxed and at
ease. The silver-armored warriors behind him also seemed quite
relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaolou, what’s
going on in your Cloudwater Manor?” The black-armored youth
laughed. “Just now, when the watchers of the Imperial Guard
headquarters were scanning the entire imperial capital, they realized
that thirty-six Loose Immortals had appeared in the air above
Cloudwater Manor, and that they had all formed into the Kindwater
Godsnake and flew into this building. Something happen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Imperial Guards
watched over the entire imperial capital, including the streets, the
arenas, and the many Immortal estates. Once powerful ripples of
battle were felt, the Imperial Guard would immediately hurry over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, places like
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain or Cloudwater Manor would often have
some gambling duels and battles; these locations had all applied for
permission for these events from the Grand Xia Dynasty. That was why
they were permitted to hold battles, ‘with conditions’. The
so-called ‘battles with conditions’ were almost all gambling
battles and duels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Assassinations,
however, were still absolutely forbidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Imperial Guard
had first noticed the powerful ripples coming from Cloudwater Manor,
they had thought that it was a fairly powerful betting duel going on.
Only after seeing the thirty-six Loose Immortals form into the
Kindwater Godsnake did they realize that something was wrong! Still,
with so many experts protecting Cloudwater Manor, the Imperial Guard
didn’t panic; one of the deputy commanders just grabbed a few
people and casually sauntered over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was an
assassination,” Xiaolou laughed. “The Loose Immortal Deathsworn
assassin should have been Immortal Floatcloud of the Youngflame clan.
Brother Hong, although I say that it was Immortal Floatcloud, that’s
just a guess.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Floatcloud
of the Youngflame clan? Who was he assassinating?” The
black-armored youth, Xiamang Hong, exclaimed in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaolou pointed at
Ning. “Look. Him right there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Hong looked
towards Ning with curiosity. “Him?” Xiamang Hong said, “The
Youngflame clan sent a Deathsworn to assassinate you, but you remain
alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
This man was excessively impolitic in his words; he actually said to
the assassination target, ‘you remain alive’?! How was Ning even
supposed to respond to that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, let me make
the introductions,” Xiaolou said. “This is Deputy Commander
Xiamang Hong of the Imperial Guard, and a good friend of mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood. Xiamang Hong? So he was of the imperial clan of the Grand
Xia. Most likely, he was viewed with some degree of importance by the
imperial clan; otherwise, Kindwater Xiaolou wouldn’t be so
courteous to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Hong, this
Ji Ning is a good friend of mine; when Immortal Floatcloud tried to
assassinate him, he used the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation to seal
the region off from outsiders, causing the many Immortals of my
Cloudwater Manor to be unable to save Ji Ning in time. Fortunately,
Ji Ning had a Primaltwin, and his Primaltwin should have been at the
Primal Daoist level…and yet, he was able to actually kill Immortal
Floatcloud. You tell me; is he amazing or not?” Xiaolou said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that
amazing?” Xiamang Hong’s eyes lit up. “Ji Ning? I know about
you. You are the little Wanxiang Adept fellow who killed Youngflame
Nong, right? I didn’t expect that you’d actually have a
Primaltwin. If my memory serves, you’ve only trained for thirty
years…and in thirty short years, your produced a Primaltwin that
was able to kill Immortal Floatcloud, who was a full tier higher in
power? Impressive, impressive. I, Xiamang Hong, deeply admire people
of ability. I imagine that after this assassination attempt, you are
a bit unsettled; in a few days, I’ll send someone to invite you
over. I’ll put on a feast, and we can chat a bit. You have to give
me this face, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I naturally will
accept Commander Xiamang’s invitation,” the black-robed Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, you
truly did scare me silly this time,” Xiaolou said, looking at Ning.
“It was a series of frightening events; even I thought that you
would find it hard to overcome this tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning’s
power is truly formidable. In this Conclave of Immortal Destiny, I am
certain that brother Ji Ning will shine quite brightly,” Skyfarmer
Songspear nodded in praise as well. For Ning to be able to use his
true body to survive the attack from the Whitebone Immortal Slaying
Needle was enough for Skysong to feel certain that Ning’s true body
was incredibly powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I quite admire
brother Ji Ning as well,” Fairy Wavecolor said with a laugh while
looking towards the nearby Xiao Lang. “But just now, someone was
provoking brother Ji Ning repeatedly, insisting on sparring with him
and looking down on him…and saying that if brother Ji Ning went to
the Conclave, he would just lose face…and advising Ji Ning to go
back home and train for three more centuries…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person who said
that is quite incredible as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang’s face
instantly began to alternate between purple and pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that
earlier, he had provoked Ning repeatedly, and had even spoken
disdainfully about Ning afterwards. When he had defeated Fairy
Wavecolor, he had indeed felt quite smug, and in his arrogance had
said quite a few unpleasant things. Now, looking back…it did all
seem quite laughable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look down on Ji
Ning? Told him to not to go lose face in the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny, and to go home and train for three more centuries instead?”
Xiamang Hong could tell what was going on, but he put on an act as he
asked with ‘curiosity’, “Who in the world said that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who else could it
be? None other than the distinguished, elegant, and suave young
master, Adept Xiao Lang,” Fairy Wavecolor said, pointing at Xiao
Lang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, Xiao Lang had
given her no face at all. Women…held grudges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiao Lang? It was
you who looked down upon Ji Ning?” Xiamang Mang clearly was playing
his role to perfection as he looked at Xiao Lang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiao Lang gritted his
teeth, his face pale. “Hmph.” He let out an angry snort, then
turned and left, pushing open the main door and walking out from the
corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He left?” Xiamang
Hong shook his head. “Boooring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou was
still looking at Ning. “Brother Ji Ning, you suffered an
assassination attempt at my Cloudwater Manor, and we weren’t even
able to help save you; the Cloudwater Manor was remiss…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Cloudwater Manor
is not to blame. This feud is one that I caused myself,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since our Kindwater
clan has established Cloudwater Manor, we absolutely have to protect
our guests who come here. There is nothing more to be said about
this; it was our Kindwater clan who did not do what we were supposed
to. Here is a treasure I recently acquired; I saw that you, brother
Ji Ning, are exceptionally formidable in lotus techniques, and this
treasure might help bring you some more insight.” Xiaolou suddenly
produced a very slender bottle in his hand, topped by a lotus flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This lotus bottle
has been infused with some of the essence of the arcane secrets of
the lotus within it; I’ll give it to you in recompense,” Xiaolou
said, handing it over to Ning. “Brother Ji Ning, no need to refuse;
if you refuse, I truly won’t know what to do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated a
moment, then accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to tell
at a single glance that this lotus bottle was extraordinary; the
bottle itself wasn’t too impressive of a treasure, but the lotus
flower on top of it was covered with many runes. It was indeed worth
analyzing. It might indeed help inspire Ning to further perfect his
Lotusflower Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for a
few more moments, Ning made his farewells. He had just suffered an
assassination attempt, after all; there was no way this banquet could
continue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before Cloudwater
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Xiaolou and
Skyfarmer Songspear watched as Ning flew out within that giant
warship, which sent out waves of energy as it departed. They were
silent for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Hong led a
group of Imperial Guard over and learned about this event. I imagine
that soon, the entire Imperial Guard will know about it…and as a
result, the entire imperial capital will know about it.” Xiaolou
sighed. “Word of this battle is going to quickly spread over the
entire imperial capital. Ji Ning has now truly become famous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when Ning
had purchased the peacock plumes, others thought that he had simply
been lucky. But this time, however, Ning had proven his power in
battle; only now would others truly esteem him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true. He’s
only trained for thirty years, but has already produced a Primaltwin,
and one which can kill a supreme Loose Immortal at that. A genius
like him is quite rare, even in the imperial capital. The Youngflame
clan has actually attracted an enemy like him…I imagine that in a
few thousand years or a few tens of thousands of years, Ji Ning will
be able to give the Youngflame clan quite a few good battles,”
Songspear said with a laugh.

Chapter 32 - A Silent Prayer
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nightfall. A cold wind
was howling through the air. Within the Youngflame clan’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The current clan leader
of the Youngflame Clan, the Godplume Duke, was currently seated in
his study. He had no desire to keep reading through the book he was
holding. There was just a single thought in his mind; had the
assassination of Ji Ning succeeded?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tonight, Kindwater
Xiaolou had invited Ji Ning to a banquet. Immortal Floatcloud was
going to take the chance to assassinate Ji Ning. Naturally, the
Godplume Duke knew of this plan. He was waiting for the results.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke
suddenly turned to look at the life-tablet placed at the edges of his
table. This was the life-tablet of Immortal Floatcloud, and at this
moment, it had shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Floatcloud died. It
seems the assassination attempt was made. However, I don’t know if
it was a success or not.” The Godplume Duke took a deep breath.
Regardless of whether it had succeeded or not, Floatcloud would
perish. If he succeeded, then he would go reincarnate; if he failed,
his soul would be shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke
continued to quietly wait for news to arrive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” An
azure-robed servant charged in, then immediately whispered, “We
have word.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” the
Godplume Duke said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Floatcloud
attempted to assassinate Ji Ning in Cloudwater Manor, and he even
used the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation, engaging in a one-on-one
fight with Ji Ning within it. But Ji Ning suddenly produced a
Primaltwin and killed Immortal Floatcloud,” the azure-robed servant
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke had
an ugly look on his face. He hesitated for a moment, then said with a
frown, “You said Ji Ning’s Primaltwin killed Immortal Floatcloud?
But his true body is only at the Wanxiang level; can it be that his
Primaltwin has already trained to the Void-level and become an Earth
Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Primaltwin
should be at the Primal level,” the azure-robed servant said.
“There shouldn’t be any mistake about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godplume Duke sat
there quietly pondering, and the azure-robed servant didn’t dare to
make another sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After pondering for
quite some time, the Godplume Duke said coldly, “Immortal
Floatcloud was a Loose Immortal of my Youngflame clan; how dare he
act in such an audacious way? Without receiving permission from my
Youngflame clan, he actually dared to go attempt to assassinate Ji
Ning on his own accord! This is a violation of the laws of the clan.
Inform the outside world that Immortal Floatcloud violated the laws
of the clan and has been expelled from the Youngflame clan, and is no
longer a member of the clan. Also - blot out his name from the
Youngflame clan registrar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
azure-robed servant said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go now.” The
Godplume Duke waved his hand, and the azure-robed servant hurriedly
retreated. As for the Godplume Duke himself, he sat there quietly for
a long moment. This wasn’t the news he had wanted; in fact, it was
the worst news possible. Ji Ning had actually been able to rely on
his own power to kill Immortal Floatcloud. Then killing Ji Ning…was
truly going to be difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s trained for
thirty years, but is already so formidable; he needs to be killed.
But in the imperial capital…killing him will be as hard as
ascending to heaven. I imagine that we’ll have to wait for him to
leave the city before our Youngflame clan will be able to use all of
the methods available to us to deal with him. But who knows how long
we will have to wait before Ji Ning will leave?” The Godplume Duke
quietly pondered this issue. “I can only hope that his true body
will be killed in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny by other supreme
geniuses! His true body has far more potential than his Primaltwin
does; so long as it dies, then his threat will be greatly lessened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Primaltwin
was currently more powerful than Ning’s true body, without
question, the true body had more potential and a much more solid
foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s time to pay a
visit Patriarch Arcanum.” In truth, the Godplume Duke felt some
resentment as well. This was all because Patriarch Arcanum had doted
on Youngflame Nong too much; otherwise, how could all of this
nonsense have occurred?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once news of this
battle spreads, the various major powers of the imperial capital will
most likely all learn about Ji Ning. My Youngflame clan will have
truly lost face.” The Godplume Duke shook his head. Then, by
himself, he boarded his Immortal carriage and departed from the
imperial capital to go pay his respects to Patriarch Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the Imperial
Guards under the command of Xiamang Hong returned to their
headquarters, the news that Ning’s Primaltwin had killed a Loose
Immortal quickly spread throughout the entire headquarters. The
Imperial Guard was the most important military which guarded the
imperial capital; all of the various major clans had disciples within
it, and so this news quickly spread to all of the major clans as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now they all understood
that it wasn’t that Ji Ning didn’t know his own limits; rather,
it was that he did indeed have enough ability to back up his actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…… <BR> Stillwater
Commander. The Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the powers that
paid the most attention to Ning, the one which cared the most was the
Black-White College. Within the Headmaster’s Hall of the
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew
headmaster, why have you asked us to all gather here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, for what reason have you asked us to hurry here
so late at night?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first generation
Immortals and the second generation Primal Daoists who were gathered
within the hall all spoke out to ask questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. Listen to me read this intelligence report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jadesea, the
Headmaster, was holding a copy of an intelligence report sent from
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. He read aloud, “Tonight, in the
Kindwater clan’s Cloudwater Manor located in the imperial capital
of the Grand Xia, Kindwater Xiaolou hosted a banquet for Ji Ning. Ji
Ning attended with a troop of Golden Imperials. Halfway through the
banquet, Immortal Floatcloud suddenly appeared. He first used a
Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle to ambush Ji Ning, who was heavily
injured but managed to stay alive. Immortal Floatcloud then utilized
the Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation to seal off the surrounding area,
then engaged in a one-on-one fight with Ji Ning. Ji Ning’s
Primaltwin suddenly emerged. His Primaltwin had already reached the
peak Primal level. By using a sword formation technique involving
hundreds of Heaven-ranked flying swords, he executed Immortal
Floatcloud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hall was completely
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was speechless
for a moment…and then, a storm of commotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew
headmaster, are you sure about what you read?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you speak the
truth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s
Primaltwin killed Immortal Floatcloud?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them could
believe it. Many of them had actually been present when Ning had
joined the school. That little fellow who had only been a Zifu
Disciple…after just ten or so years, he had killed a Loose
Immortal? Was this a joke?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a report
from the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. How could they lie about
something like this?” Daoist Jadesea looked at his fellow
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful.” Immortal Fivecraze called out, “This is absolutely
wonderful. Spread the news. Let all of the disciples of our
Black-White College learn of this matter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some would celebrate,
some would mourn. News of Ning’s battle spread throughout the
entire imperial capital, and it also spread to the ears of certain
people located in many other commandery cities. Some celebrated, some
sighed in amazement, some felt jealousy, and some felt disdain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Highwater Commander.
The Dongyan Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night. Within a
mountain peak inside the Dongyan Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was seated by
herself at the edges of a cliff. The cold night wind felt as sharp as
knives of ice, but Ninelotus allowed the wind to blow against her as
she continued to sit there silently. Ever since she and Ning had
parted ways at the Witchriver Immortal Estate, Ninelotus had begun to
enjoy sitting by herself in this quiet place at night, a time of
absolute stillness. She would just watch quietly until the sun rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out. Ninelotus turned to look. A very
beautiful woman walked over; it was her mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus’ mother
looked at her daughter, feeling quite pained for her. Ninelotus and
her were extremely close. When Ninelotus had returned from the
Witchriver Immortal Estate, she had been truly been heartbroken, but
had no one to talk to about it. Her mother had consoled her, and
eventually, Ninelotus had told her mother about the pain in her
heart. Only then did her mother realize that her daughter had very
nearly chosen to completely walk the same path with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Yun, are you
still not over it?” The mother sat down as well, looking at her
daughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been over it
for quite some time,” Ninelotus said, gently shaking her head. “I
just continue to feel ashamed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you feel ashamed,
how can you say you are over it?” Her mother shook her head. “No
need to be ashamed. This Ji Ning, he isn’t worth you feeling
ashamed over. He just came from a backwater clan; how good could his
upbringing have possibly been? The two of you belong in completely
separate worlds. There’s no way the two of you could’ve been
together. No way at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough,” Ninelotus
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to
command the entire Dongyan clan, and the Forefather of the Dongyan
clan has full faith in you. You need to stir yourself up. You might
not be able to forget about him now, but in a few centuries or
millennia, you’ll realize that he was actually just a very ordinary
passerby in your life. Nothing more than a bumpkin. Forget about
him,” Ninelotus’ mother said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before Ninelotus was
born, her mother and her father had decent lives in the Dongyan clan,
but were quite ordinary figures. However, after Ninelotus was born,
she was loved and doted upon by the Dongyan clan’s Forefather, who
trained her and assigned her to be the next clan leader. Thus,
Ninelotus’ father and mother saw their statuses skyrocket, and they
now had a very great deal of power within the Dongyan clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t a
bumpkin.” Ninelotus stared at her mother. “He is my former
Dao-companion, and a true genius!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what good is a
genius? He might just end up being killed by the Youngflame clan,”
her mother said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough!” Ninelotus
was growing angry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother forced down
her anger. Ninelotus was the next clan leader, after all, and so
normally she and her husband would listen to Ninelotus. But with
regards to Ji Ning…the mother had always nursed a belly full of
anger. How exalted a status did her daughter have? How could she
possibly be together with someone who came from a backwater tribe?
That was an absolute travesty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mistress, mistress!”
Suddenly, a female servant flew in on a flying sword, landing on the
mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Ninelotus
looked at her servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain sent an intelligence report. It has to do with
young master Ji Ning,” the female servant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus waved her
hand, and the intelligence report scroll immediately flew towards
her. By her side, her mother said unhappily, “You said you are over
it, but you continue to pay attention to his intelligence reports?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does being over it
mean that I can no longer pay attention to news regarding him?”
Ninelotus gave her mother a glance, then unfurled the scroll to read
it. A look of shock and amazement appeared on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.
What’s this all about? Was he killed by the Youngflame clan?” Her
mother snatched it over to take a read. And as she did…she was so
shocked that she jumped to her feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ki-ki-killed
Immortal Floatcloud of the Youngflame clan?” She was astonished.
“He’s only trained for thirty years, right? How could, how, how
could…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you. He is a
genius.” Ninelotus said softly, “Mother, go home. Let me be by
myself for a while.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother was truly
stunned by this news as well. She simply couldn’t comprehend it.
How could this young fellow from a backwater tribe, who was even
younger than her own daughter, have actually killed a supreme Loose
Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stunned, she left
obediently. The maidservant left as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sat there by
herself, silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you are
doing well, I can be at ease. Ji Ning…stay alive.” Ninelotus
could only pray silently in her heart. When she had chosen the path
of becoming the next leader of the Dongyan clan, she had decided to
follow this path to its completion. As for Ji Ning? All she could do
was silently pray for him in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because, after
their parting at the Witchriver Immortal Estate…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall be you,
and I shall be me…”

Chapter 33 - From Whence Came, To Where Go
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a late, cold
winter night. The temperature was bone-chillingly low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Princess Xiyue, of
King Yan’s Estate, was filled with burning rage. She angrily
slammed her hand against the table. “The Youngflame clan is truly
damnable. They actually dare to attempt an assassination within the
imperial capital. Damnable, damnable, absolutely damnable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, although the
Youngflame clan sent a Loose Immortal Deathsworn, that person ended
up dying in my hands,” Ji Ning said. “Don’t be so angry,
cousin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I not be
angry?” Princess Xiyue looked towards Ning. “I’m still covered
in cold sweat. Fortunately, you are strong and were able to block
both the Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needles as well as Immortal
Floatcloud. If not…little brother, aside from Grandpa, you are my
own family.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If her one and only
little brother would have died…Princess Xiyue didn’t even know
what she would’ve done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
is utterly damnable,” Princess Xiyue said, so angry that she was
shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their strategy this
time of sending out a Loose Immortal Deathsworn failed. I imagine
that for now, they won’t have any other tricks up their sleeves; so
long as I stay within the imperial capital, the Youngflame clan
shouldn’t be able to do anything to me,” Ning hurriedly consoled
his cousin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue took a
deep breath, then nodded. “Right. There is nothing else they can do
to you. I imagine that a year later though, during the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, they will use the rules of the Conclave to act
against you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against others who
are at the peak Wanxiang level…although I don’t dare say that I
am unequaled in the world, I should be able to keep myself alive.”
Ning’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Cousin, my Primaltwin just finished
binding the storage treasure which the deceased Immortal Floatcloud
left behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Yuchi Xiyue’s
eyes lit up as well. “Let’s see what sort of treasure Immortal
Floatcloud left behind. However…since he dared to attempt to
assassinate you, and also carried a Whitebone Immortal Slaying Needle
and a Bloodcoil Heavenlock Formation with him, I imagine that he no
longer had many other treasures on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a close
look.” Ning nodded. He immediately began to have his Primaltwin,
located within the underwater estate, to carefully investigate each
treasure. Suddenly, Ning revealed a look of astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Yuchi
Xiyue asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other treasures
are as I expected, but I found a scroll.” Ning waved his hand, and
a golden scroll suddenly appeared within it, emanating ripples of
power that were ancient and strange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This scroll…?”
Yuchi Xiyue looked at it, also curious. Ning unfurled the scroll.
Atop the golden scroll, there was just a single, simple line of
characters. They stated:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From whence come, to
where go. Xiamang Xun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single stroke was
simple and plain, but an aura of majesty exploded forth from them.
Both Ning and Xiyue felt their hearts tremble; they felt as if they
were facing the heavens themselves. Even Ning, when facing that
ancient Fiendgod in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains, hadn’t
felt such terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning hurriedly
closed the scroll, and only then did the terrifying majesty
completely disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world is
this?” Xiyue was absolutely amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a single line
of characters; from whence come, to where go. And a single, simple
signature inscription - Xiamang Xun. Who exactly is Xiamang Xun? Can
it be that he is an ancient member of the imperial Xiamang clan?”
Xiyue was completely puzzled. “Why haven’t I ever heard of this
name before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with a frown,
“The person who wrote the line of words should be named Xiamang
Xun…and judging from the majestic power from those words, he should
be an incredibly powerful figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go ask
Grandpa,” Xiyue immediately said. “Wait a moment for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now? So late
at night?” Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. My
grandfather is a Celestial Immortal; do you think there is a big
difference between day and night for him? And he lives by himself; he
doesn’t even let maidservants move close to him. It’s fine for me
to find him late at night. And I’m in quite an uneasy mood as well;
I feel as though this scroll is quite extraordinary. Wait a moment;
I’ll be back shortly.” Xiyue hurriedly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In just the amount of
time needed to boil a kettle of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue once more flew
back gracefully, her face filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, what’d he
say?” Ning was quite curious as well as to exactly what this scroll
is.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know who
Xiamang Xun is?” Xiyue had a secretive look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?” Ning asked.
He had never heard of this name before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is his Imperial
Majesty, the Emperor of our Grand Xia Dynasty!” Xiyue whispered to
him, “He’s also the founder of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and the
sovereign of this major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial
Majesty, the Emperor?” Ning was awestruck. The Grand Xia Emperor
stood far above them. He was the sovereign of this entire major
world, and his power filled the skies. In fact, it was said that the
Grand Xia Emperor could even sit down and speak to the Celestial
Emperor as equals. One was the Emperor of a major world of the mortal
realms; the other was the Emperor of the Deva realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how things had
been since the Fiendgod Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
had never been anyone else. He rarely showed himself; after all, this
ancient dynasty which he had founded and which had existed for
countless millions of years had long ago stabilized. It had its own
laws, and most matters could be handled by his senior officials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was powerful. After
all, he had single-handedly established an enormous dynasty and
unified the world, after the end of the Fiendgod Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was mysterious. Over
the course of countless years, he had almost never shown himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was exalted. No one
in the Grand Xia Dynasty dared to go against his decrees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the sovereign of
this major world, who had stood at its very peak from the Fiendgod
Era until now, a figure who the vast majority of Earth Immortals and
Loose Immortals couldn’t even approach…very few people even knew
his name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. His Imperial
Majesty, the Emperor. This is his name.” Xiyue was extremely
excited. “Xiamang Xun…that’s the name of his Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Xun, his
Imperial Majesty…the Emperor…” Ning’s heart was suddenly
filled with fright and nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his subconscious…he
suddenly felt as though a pair of eyes was staring directly at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when he
hadn’t known this was the name of the Emperor, Ning hadn’t felt
anything. But now that he knew…he felt in his subconscious as
though a pair of eyes had suddenly turned towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know what
this scroll is?” Xiyue didn’t sense anything amiss at all. All
she felt was excitement and energy. “A dharmic decree of
reincarnation! This is a dharmic decree that was personally penned by
the Grand Xia Emperor. If you possess this decree, once you perish,
the dharmic decree will escort and accompany your soul into the
Netherworld Kingdom. When the Yama-Kings of the Ten Halls see this
dharmic decree, they will naturally give some face to our Grand Xia
Emperor. The line of ‘from whence come, to whence go’ is an
instruction; it means that the bearer is to reborn back into the
major world and the clan from whence he last lived in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was enlightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yama-Kings of the
Ten Halls. The Lord of Cui Palace. All of them had exalted statuses
in the Netherworld Kingdom. For them, letting a few Immortals return
to their own major world and clans was nothing more than a minor
matter. It could also be viewed as helping to build up ties between
themselves and the major power who wrote the dharmic decree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. My
grandfather said that you are not to rashly tell others of the name
of his Imperial Majesty,” Xiyue said hurriedly. “According to
what my grandfather said, if you say his Imperial Majesty’s name
aloud, his Imperial Majesty will sense it. However, since we are
within King Yan’s Estate, his Imperial Majesty won’t mind too
much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. I won’t
tell others,” Ning immediately said. In his heart, however, he felt
shocked. So just now, when he felt in his subconscious as though a
pair of eyes were paying attention to him…it had probably been his
Imperial Majesty, the Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. News of
Ning’s Primaltwin’s slaying of Immortal Floatcloud spread, and
Ning’s fame grew greater and greater. In the imperial capital,
almost everyone believed that Ning had an exceedingly high level of
insight into the Dao; far higher, at least, than Immortal Floatcloud
possessed. Otherwise, how could he have so fought him, despite
Immortal Floatcloud being at a higher tier of power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater Commandery.
Within a private training room in the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist, the
number one figure amongst the third generation disciples, was seated
in the lotus position. He was only wearing pants, his upper body
unclad. The skin on his upper body was actually covered with runes
that looked like the shell of a tortoise, and series of
ancient-feeling ripples of power poured out from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, within the
private training room, the illusion of an incomparably enormous
Turtle-Snake appeared. This Turtle-Snake filled nearly the entire
training room, and the Sloppy Daoist stood on the illusory
Turtle-Snake’s back. The entire Turtle-Snake began to move, and
both the turtle head and the serpent head emitted growling roars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A layer of turtle shell
began to appear on the Sloppy Daoist’s entire body as he sat there,
but his eyes were like the eyes of a snake, capable of filling the
hearts of viewers with terror. His aura was incredibly ancient and
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Sloppy
Daoist suddenly frowned. In his subconscious, he could feel something
calling to him. It was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny?” The Sloppy Daoist mumbled to himself, “What’s
going on? Why is it that when I’m training in the Black Tortoise 1
divine ability, my subconscious is foretelling that this upcoming
Conclave is going to be quite important. It seems as though it is a
major chance for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The powerful call was
so strong that the Sloppy Daoist was almost unable to suppress it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist knew
very well that this sort of subconscious feeling didn’t need to be
doubted; if he could sense that it was going to be a major stroke of
luck for him, then he had to go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t like
fighting and struggling with others. I just want to quietly relax and
train. But…I didn’t expect that in the end, I still have to go to
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny.” The Sloppy Daoist nodded
lightly. “What shall be, shall be. Those things that are meant to
be mine will be; for those things that aren’t meant to be mine,
there’s no need to force it. I’ll go give this Conclave a try and
test out these geniuses of our major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve just reached
the second Cycle of my Black Tortoise divine ability. I was planning
to break through to the Primal level, but it now seems that I
shouldn’t be in a hurry. After this Conclave of Immortal Destiny is
concluded, I’ll make my breakthrough.” The Sloppy Daoist no
longer considered this matter, and began to train once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous phantom of
a Turtle-Snake once more filled the entire training room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist was
like an ancient, primordial Fiendgod. He sat there quietly,
meditating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the great Darknorth
Sea, there was an Immortal island known as Goldcrow Island. The
master of this island was referred to as Immortal Goldcrow; he was a
truly mighty Void-level Earth Immortal. Although he had only reached
the Void level a century ago, he had been famous for a long period of
time. He had the lineage of the Golden Crow, and so although he was
merely a Void-level Earth Immortal, he was close to Celestial
Immortals in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Darknorth Sea,
there were countless powers who wanted to befriend him, but Immortal
Goldcrow was solitary and did as he pleased. As someone with the
lineage of the Golden Crows, and as a man with a strange temper who
was quite bloodthirsty, there were very few powers who dared to
antagonize him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Goldcrow Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden-robed Immortal
Goldcrow was seated at the front of a grand palace, expounding on the
Dao. Before him were six young men and women who were listening
reverently. These were the six major disciples of Immortal Goldcrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During a pause in the
expounding of the Dao, the eldest of the six disciples, a human,
spoke out and asked, “Master, I heard that the Grand Xia Dynasty is
about to hold the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Your disciple wishes
to go; may I?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, with your level
of power, plan to go to the Conclave of Immortal Destiny? Do you want
to die?” Immortal Goldcrow responded calmly, but as soon as his
words came out, his face suddenly changed.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Goldcrow could
sense a powerful beckoning coming from his subconscious, from deep in
his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I suddenly
have such a powerful premonition?” Immortal Goldcrow was stunned;
as an Immortal cultivator, he placed a great deal of faith in his
subconscious premonitions. “It seems as though this Conclave of
Immortal Destiny will be very important to me…as though it is
calling for me to attend…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, your
disciple isn’t that bad. If I truly am unable to win it, then I
will immediately give up and admit defeat.” The senior disciple,
unhappy, hurriedly added, “This Conclave of Immortal Destiny will
see countless geniuses from this major world gather together. A
chance like this will probably only come once in a lifetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Goldcrow,
whose mind had been wandering, quickly returned to his senses.
“Enough!” Immortal Goldcrow snapped with a frown, still seated at
the front of the hall. “That little bit of talent you possess; you
think that’s ‘not bad’? You have always stayed in a distant
island and your experiences are very shallow. You’ve only heard of
the Conclave; you have no idea how formidable the geniuses
participating in the Conclave truly are. This is a report from the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain regarding the previous Conclave; go ahead
and read it.” As he spoke, he produced a book in his hand, then
tossed it out. His senior disciple hurriedly caught it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To enter the
Conclave without having at least a bit of ability…you won’t even
have a chance to admit defeat.” Immortal Goldcrow rose to his feet.
Whoosh. He transformed into a rainbow, disappearing from their sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother, you angered Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother, let me take a look at this book as well. How
formidable are the participants of the Conclave?” The other junior
apprentice-brothers and junior apprentice-sisters all crowded around
as well. As for Immortal Goldcrow, he had already arrived within his
own Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Immortal estate
could not be carried away, but it had tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one else was inside
the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Goldcrow
quickly entered a pavilion, within which sat a black-robed man. The
black-robed man and Immortal Goldcrow appeared nearly identical;
only, Immortal Goldcrow had a stronger and more bloodthirsty aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
the reason I had that premonition is because my true body is still at
the peak Wanxiang level.” The black-robed man rose to his feet.
“Although I have already had a stroke of great fortune, from my
subconscious premonition…it seems as though this Conclave is going
to be an extremely important one. I might be able to truly soar into
the heavens at this Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I, Bu Yi, wish to
become a Celestial Immortal, it seems that my chance will come
through this Conclave of Immortal Destiny.” The black-robed man
continued to mutter to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been the son of
a fisherman. In his youth, he accompanied his father out to sea to
catch fish, but because of a great storm, the waves had caused the
ship to capsize. He had passed out, and by the time he had woken up,
he had found out to his astonishment that he had entered an estate in
the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an estate left
behind by a powerful predecessor, and was filled with many
cultivation techniques, arts, divine abilities, and even some supreme
visualization techniques, along with magic treasures and curious
items. There had even been an amount of liquefied elemental essence
which had accumulated over the course of years within the estate,
forming a giant pond with at least five million kilograms. Amongst
the various precious treasures, he had also discovered a Golden
Crow’s egg. His youthful self had settled down in the estate,
focusing on his training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, he had
been a cultivator in his past life as well; his soul was innately
powerful to begin with, and with the aid of the supreme visualization
techniques, when his true body had reached the Wanxiang level, he had
split his soul, using the created half to possess the Golden Crow’s
egg. Afterwards, the egg had hatched, and the Golden Crow had been
born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Golden Crow had an
extremely pure lineage; only after training to the Void level had he
been able to transform into human shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of many
long years, Bu Yi had wandered the great Darknorth Sea, experiencing
many life-and-death dangers. Thanks to the Golden Crow Primaltwin
body he had acquired thanks to his great stroke of fortune as a
youth, he had managed to overcome those dangerous situations and
profit from them. After his Primaltwin had experienced the Three
Calamities and Nine Tribulations, he had decided to break through to
become a Void-level Earth Immortal. He had more than two hundred
years before the next calamity descended; for Bu Yi, this was more
than enough time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although my
Primaltwin’s body is that of a Golden Crow and is extremely
powerful…” the black-robed Bu Yi shook his head. “But the body
is a possessed one. I’m a human, whereas Golden Crows are monsters.
Although I possessed the egg…I was at most able to complete a 70%
or 80% fusion with it. Training to the Void level is most likely my
limit. To overcome the tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal?
There’s no hope at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Possessing a Golden
Crow’s egg was a stroke of tremendous fortune. When he had been
very weak and young, he hadn’t hesitated at all to make this
choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, a Primaltwin
acquired through possession wouldn’t be sufficiently well fused
together, and becoming a Celestial Immortal was difficult to begin
with. Even creatures such as a Golden Crow Godbird with exceedingly
pure Golden Crow lineages would find it hard to overcome the
Celestial Tribulation. He, whose soul and body had only fused 70% or
80%, had almost no chance of overcoming it at all. He knew this quite
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny is a chance for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Bu Yi, have
roamed and dominated the Darknorth Seas. It has always been my
Primaltwin, ‘Immortal Goldcrow’, who was famous. This time…my
true body shall reveal its own brilliance as well at this Conclave of
Immortal Destiny.” The black-robed Bu Yi felt tremendous eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Goldcrow gave
instructions to his disciples to train hard, stating that he was
going out for some wandering…and then quietly left, heading towards
the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A small ship was flying
through the misty clouds, atop which was a black-robed man seated in
the lotus position, a sharp, saber-hacking aura emanating from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-robed man suddenly opened his eyes. Previously, his eyes had
been closed as he was meditating, but the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny had suddenly come to his mind, and as it did, his
subconscious began to whisper to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After bidding Master
farewell, I began to rove through the various major worlds to
adventure and train. This world of the Grand Xia Dynasty is already
my ninth major world. I completely have no interest in this so-called
‘Conclave of Immortal Destiny’; after all, I apprenticed myself
to Master long ago. But why is it that I suddenly have a feeling…as
though I should go participate? It seems as though if I don’t go,
I’ll miss something or will lose something.” The black-robed man
was mystified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he didn’t
doubt the premonitions of his subconscious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…then I might as well make a trip to the imperial capital of
the Grand Xia and participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. I
want to see how formidable the geniuses of this major world are.”
The black-robed man willed it, and the air around the small ship
began to shimmer. It then disappeared completely; he had used a void
teleportation technique to head directly towards the imperial
capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ordinary tavern
within a commandery city of the Grand Xia. A dirty-looking maiden was
completely drunk, and there was even some straw in her hair. She
continued to call out loudly, “More wine, quick, more wine!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miss, you’ve used
up all your money already,” the tavern waiter hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dirty-looking
maiden opened her eyes. “Used up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up, all of
you. I’ll let you guys hit or kick me as you please; I definitely
won’t fight back at all. Buuut, you have to help me pay some money
for wine. You don’t need to pay too much; just a gourd’s worth of
wine is enough. Just let me fill up my gourd,” the dirty-looking
maiden called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat you as I
please?” Instantly, a newcomer was intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh, yet another
poor bastard is going to fall for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That gourd just
won’t fill up no matter how you try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the regulars
were secretly muttering to each other. The guest who had wanted to
give her a kick for fun felt that something was off and immediately
stopped himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dirty maiden,
holding that gourd of wine, looked around herself. No one had come to
hit her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let you hit
or kick me as you please. I definitely won’t fight back,” the
dirty maiden called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…ugh. It seems I
need to switch places again. I can’t swindle too much in a little
place like this anyhow. Why don’t I go to a larger place…say, the
imperial capital, the largest city of them all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden was suddenly
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her blurry, drunken
eyes suddenly grew clear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She could feel a
powerful call from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, in
accordance with the way she trained her Dao, she shouldn’t have
participated in the Conclave at all. But her subconscious premonition
couldn’t be wrong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As soon as I had the
idea to go to the imperial capital, I immediately felt a strong
premonition regarding the Conclave of Immortal Destiny…it seems as
though I truly will have to go attend. Perhaps this Conclave of
Immortal Destiny will be of help to me in overcoming the tribulation
and becoming a Celestial Immortal. I’ve reincarnated nine times
now…if I fail again, then I truly will have no more hope for the
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The drunken
woman suddenly disappeared from within the tavern. As for the
ordinary mortals within the tavern, they didn’t notice anything at
all. It was as though this maiden had never appeared in their midst
before at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The truly formidable
figures who had secluded themselves throughout the vast Grand Xia
Empire, including some truly peerless monsters who had originally
disdained from attending the Conclave, all felt a call from their
subconscious. All of them changed their minds, hastening towards the
imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital.
King Yan’s Estate. Ji Ning’s Immortal estate. There was a lake in
front of it, and atop the lake, there was a small ship. Ning was
lying down in the middle of the ship, allowing it to drift where it
pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps because he had
grown into a habit of drifting on a boat at Serpentwing Lake, when
Ning lay down in a boat and let it drift where it please, his soul
felt exceptionally calm and empty. It was even often of benefit to
him in pondering secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning.” A maidservant, standing at the side of the lake, called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome, slender
fur-clad youth suddenly stood up from within the distant wooden boat.
With a single step, he disappeared from the boat and reappeared on
the shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning,” the maidservant said respectfully, “A group of people are
at the royal estate and wish to meet you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meet me? Who are
they?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They say…that they
are your fellow disciples from your school, or something like that,”
the maidservant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
He immediately transformed into a gust of wind, howling through the
air as he disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan’s Estate’s
front gate. A gust of wind blew past, and Ning appeared at the
entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning!” A white-robed youth ran over
excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Northson.” Ning, upon seeing his junior
apprentice-brother, felt extraordinarily happy as well. The two of
them clutched each other in a bear hug before letting go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had long ago begun
to view Northson as he would a true little brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you truly are amazing. You actually produced a
Primaltwin and even killed Immortal Floatcloud.” Northson was
extraordinarily excited. “When I was in the Black-White College, I
heard the news and was absolutely tickled. Hahaha, you killed
Youngflame Nong and that Fiendgod, and then you caused even a
Deathsworn sent out by the Youngflame clan to perish. Hehehe, I
wonder how infuriated the Youngflame clan is right now?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully, they’ll
die from their anger,” Ning said. And then he looked at the other
three in front of him. “Senior apprentice-brother Vastriver, senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, and eldest apprentice-brother…why have
you all come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures in front of
him were the Sloppy Daoist, Yu Wei, Vastriver, and Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei laughed, “Both
myself and our eldest apprentice-brother are participating in this
Conclave. Senior apprentice-brother Vastriver and junior
apprentice-brother Northson are here to watch. I imagine that once
the Conclave truly begins, quite a few other disciples of the
Black-White College will come to watch as well. After all, actual
participants are quite few in number, but quite a few spectators will
be present.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother, you are attending as well?” Ning was surprised.
When he had chatted with Yu Wei and the others about the Conclave, it
seemed as though the only member of the Black-White College to attend
would be Yu Wei. The others wouldn’t participate, and the leader of
the third generation disciples, the Sloppy Daoist, wasn’t planning
to attend either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should happen,
will happen,” the Sloppy Daoist said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, our
Black-White College will have a total of three participants in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, and eldest apprentice-brother. Our
Black-White College is definitely going to be famous!” Northson was
filled with anticipation.

Chapter 35 - The End Days for Snowdragon Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue was also
aware that Ji Ning’s fellow disciples had arrived, and she arranged
a special banquet for them, inviting the disciples of the Black-White
College to attend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this very day. In
the distant Stillwater Commandery. A giant warship, covered with
flowery golden tattoos, was howling through the air, sending out
waves of energy in its wake. Aboard the warship there was a large,
tightly clustered group of Golden Imperials. Upon the deck, there
were also nine black-armored Captains of the Imperial Guard, each of
whom emanated unfathomably mighty auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
is up ahead,” a black-uniformed man said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to trouble
you, fellow Daoist Skyfall,” one of the nine Golden Imperial
captains said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a small
matter. It is the good fortune of myself, Northmont Skyfall, to be
able to assist King Yan in handling this matter.” Skyfall spoke in
a flattering manner, but in his heart, he sighed to himself. “Oh,
Snowdragon Mountain…how could you be so foolish as to offend King
Yan? Even though in the past King Yan was in dire straits, he still
wasn’t someone which your puny little Snowdragon Mountain sect
could afford to offend. This time, King Yan has sent nine full squads
of Golden Imperials over. It seems as though he truly harbors hatred
for Snowdragon Mountain. I wonder what exactly Snowdragon Mountain
did to him in the past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow, Yuchi
Mount; their deaths were caused principally by Dong Seven!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xiyue
naturally hated the man deeply. King Yan knew how his granddaughter
felt, and so immediately ordered nine squads of Golden Imperials to
head towards Stillwater Commandery. He instructed them to first
notify Stillwater Commandery’s Northmont clan of the following: “In
the past, when our royal excellency was wandering the world, a feud
arose between himself and Snowdragon Mountain. Today, we have come to
annihilate Snowdragon Mountain; we’d like to ask the Northmont clan
to permit this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northmont clan’s
response: Annihilate Snowdragon Mountain? A little clan which didn’t
even have a single Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal? The Northmont
clan naturally wouldn’t care about this matter. In addition, given
how diplomatic King Yan was by first sending people to notify them,
the Northmont clan immediately arranged for Northmont Skyfall to
personally lead the way, bringing these Golden Imperials directly
towards Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.”
Skyfall pointed towards the area below them. Past the clouds, one
could vaguely make out a long, winding mountain range, amongst which
were three particularly imposing and tall mountain peaks that vastly
surpassed the other three mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon
Mountain?” The nine Imperial Guard captains looked down at the
base, all nodding slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First capture Dong
Seven, then annihilate Snowdragon Mountain,” one of the captains
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship immediately
flew downwards, carrying boundless might and power as it soared
directly towards the area above Snowdragon Mountain’s headquarters.
This instantly caused a huge shock within Snowdragon Mountain; who
would actually dare to have their warship halt directly above the
school? This was too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
fellow Daoist has arrived at Snowdragon Mountain?” Boom! Boom!
Boom! Three figures soared into the skies; they were the three Primal
Daoists of Snowdragon Mountain. Daoist Snowplume, Daoist Coldsun, and
Daoist Blackdragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon flying upwards,
their gazes were immediately drawn to the eye-catching,
golden-armored soldiers. The terrifying majesty and aura of power
emanating from the soldiers caused their hearts to quail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, upon seeing
the black-uniformed Northmont Skyfall, Daoist Blackdragon hurriedly
said, “Senior Skyfall, why have you come to our Snowdragon
Mountain? If there’s anything you need, just summon us; we will
simply go to you. There’s no need for you to personally make a
trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Skyfall,
might I ask why you have come to Snowdragon Mountain? If there is
anything you need, just tell us; we will definitely strive to
accomplish it,” Daoist Coldsun said hurriedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three Primal
Daoists were extremely courteous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen?”
Skyfall just looked at the nine Imperial Guard captains; all nine of
them were Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Found him.” The
eyes of one of the captains lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He took a single step,
then disappeared from his original location, reappearing inside the
Snowdragon Mountain headquarters. In the blink of an eye, he suddenly
flew back with a white-robed youth in tow. The white-robed youth’s
face was ashen. His entire body was shaking in abject terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Seven!”
Daoist Coldsun called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa, Grandpa!”
The white-robed youth was utterly terrified. He hurriedly called out,
“My Zifu has been destroyed, my Zifu has been destroyed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Coldsun’s face
instantly changed. A hint of rage was now visible, but he forced it
down and said angrily, “Senior Skyfall, what’s this all about?
Why have you led people here to apprehend disciples of Snowdragon
Mountain? If Snowdragon Mountain has offended you in some way, just
tell us; those who deserve to be punished will be. Snowdragon
Mountain will definitely give you a satisfactory response.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These aren’t my
men.” Northmont Skyfall shook his head. “You really have no
vision, have you? You aren’t even able to recognize the most
formidable soldiers of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, the
Golden Imperials!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden Imperials?”
Daoists Coldsun, Blackdragon, and Snowplume were all shocked.
Imperial Guards? Even in Stillwater Commandery, Snowdragon Mountain
was a fairly ordinary sect, located in a fairly distant location,
without even a single Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal to their name.
Naturally, they knew very little about the distant imperial capital.
Although Daoist Blackdragon would occasionally make a visit to the
imperial capital, he had never even seen an Imperial Guard, much less
the elite ‘Golden Imperials’ of the Guard. When they saw the
golden armor worn by the soldiers, they had taken them to be soldiers
of the Northmont clan of Stillwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generals,” Daoist
Blackdragon said hurriedly, “If Snowdragon Mountain has acted
offensively in some manner, please tell us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Coldsun and
Daoist Snowplume were terrified and restless as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have come on
orders to apprehend Dong Seven and wipe out Snowdragon Mountain,”
one of the captains said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprehend Dong
Seven? Wipe out Snowdragon Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Blackdragon and
the other two felt as though thunderbolts had suddenly come crashing
down out of the clear sky. Both were stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wipe out their school?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good, good heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their school was one
which had existed for a very long time. Everything had been perfectly
fine; why had the Golden Imperials suddenly come to wipe them out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coldsun!” Daoist
Blackdragon, upon seeing the captured Dong Seven, instantly
understood what this was about. He stared at the nearby Daoist
Coldsun, then roared furiously, “It is all your fault. You coddled
Dong Seven! Dong Seven has harmed countless people in the outside
world; even in our own school, he’s harmed quite a few of our
female disciples. But you’ve always protected him! Dong Seven must
have offended a powerful figure at some point, causing our Snowdragon
Mountain to now face complete annihilation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Coldsun’s face
was completely ashen now as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
begged, “Everyone, you can punish Dong Seven as you please. You can
even have Snowdragon Mountain do whatever you wish us to do. Just,
please give us a way out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
captain who had apprehended Dong Seven spoke out emotionlessly.
“Let’s do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With this order given,
the squads of Golden Imperials immediately began to fly out of the
warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FORMATION! PROTECT
THE MOUNTAIN!” Daoist Blackdragon let out an earsplitting bellow,
and his voice rang out in the ears of every single disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SEALS!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SNOWDRAGON SKYSOAR
FORMATION!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single formation
and restrictive spell which the previous generations experts of
Snowdragon Mountain had every created were instantly activated. One
seal after another instantly appeared, hovering in the air. Clouds
and mist appeared. One snowy white dragon after another began to
appear as well, flying and weaving amidst the skies above the
mountains. When a school unleashed all of its stored powers at once,
even a Loose Immortal would find it difficult to break through the
school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One divine golden
dragon after another began to appear in the skies. There were a total
of eight divine golden dragons, each of which was coiled and nearly
ten thousand kilometers long, and emanated a majestic presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that
ordinary Loose Immortals would find it difficult to break through
Snowdragon Mountain’s headquarters…but a squad of Golden
Imperials consisted of a Loose Immortal commanding forty nine Primal
Daoists, all of whom were dressed in Dao-armor, and who joined
together to form into a divine dragon! Their might was at the very
least comparable to ten ordinary Loose Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And here…there were
nine squads!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden dragons
coiled and writhed in the sky. A simple thwack from one of the tails
caused all of the seals to explode and crack, bursting as if they
were soap bubbles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captain who had
captured Dong Seven just watched from above. As for the other eight
squads, they had all transformed into golden dragons and were
launching attacks at the below Snowdragon Mountain. With absolute
superiority in raw power…they smashed through every single grand
sealing formation. As for the so-called bewildering formations? Every
single divine dragon was ten thousand kilometers in length; a single
trembling movement from them caused entire formations to break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…”
Daoist Coldsun had led his own disciples to form into an enormous
Snowdragon. But, upon seeing the might and power of the divine golden
dragons, he was so terrified he didn’t even dare to go block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Primal Daoist,
leading a group of Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples in forming a
Snowdragon…and he was supposed to fight against a divine dragon
formed by a Loose Immortal leading forty nine Primal Daoists? They
were on completely separate levels. The difference in power was just
too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Dong Seven…who
the hell did you offend…” Daoist Coldsun felt both fury and
despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finished.”
Daoist Snowplume led his disciples to block, but at the very first
exchange, more than half of his disciples perished and the Snowdragon
was completely shattered. A look of despair appeared on Daoist
Snowplume’s face. “Snowdragon Mountain is finished. Damn us…damn
us for not being strict in carrying out the laws of the sect. Our
disciples have caused harm everywhere, and in the end…they finally
offended a powerful figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
instantly blew apart, causing an enormous storm of elemental ki. He
had chosen self-detonation; this way, at least his soul would be able
to reincarnate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Snowplume
self-detonated. Daoist Coldsun was killed. Daoist Blackdragon was
killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single mountain
peak that belonged to Snowdragon Mountain was overturned. Under the
majestic power of these eight divine dragons that were ten thousand
kilometers in length, some parts were crushed down to form a lakebed,
while other parts were flattened into plains. In short…not a single
true mountain could now be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…”
Dong Seven was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Skyfall, sorry for the trouble. We’ll head straight back to the
imperial capital now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a small
matter. Snowdragon Mountain offended King Yan; they invited
annihilation upon themselves. They cannot blame anyone but
themselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll leave
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please do. I won’t
send you off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of Golden
Imperials immediately led Dong Seven aboard their warship, then
departed. As for Northmont Skyfall, he stared at the former
Snowdragon Mountains, which had now been smashed into lakes and
plains. He couldn’t help but shake his head. “A small sect like
this…they weren’t strict in their rules, and their disciples
harmed many. The karmic luck of the school would naturally continue
to drop, until finally, one day, annihilation arrived. How utterly
laughable…even the imperial clan of the Grand Xia erected the
Raindragon Guard and sent them out to apprehend and execute sinners
for the sake of improving their luck, but a small sect like this
actually acted with such wild abandon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Northmont
Skyfall disappeared into thin air, teleporting away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snow was drifting
downwards right now as a group of Golden Imperials entered King Yan’s
Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brothers, go get
some rest, but keep an eye on that Dong Seven. I’m going to go
report to the Princess right now,” a captain said, then immediately
went to go see her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a wide, spacious
hall. A banquet had been prepared here. Ning and Xiyue were currently
accompanying Northson and the others, watching the snow while eating
and chatting together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reporting to the
Princess,” the captain said respectfully as he appeared, “We’ve
caught him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xiyue both
looked at the captain, and as they did, both were breathless. Upon
hearing the words, “We’ve caught him”, both of them couldn’t
help but rise to their feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, Ji Ning
and I have something to attend to. We’ll return shortly,” Yuchi
Xiyue said immediately.

Chapter 36 - The Grand Xia Emperor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dark, gloomy room.
There were many instruments of punishment located in this room. In
the center, there was a punishment rack, atop which was bound a
terrified, pathetic-looking white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…”
Dong Seven stared at the punishment instruments, face utterly ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it? Who
exactly did I offend?” Dong Seven was absolutely horrified. “They
actually annihilated Snowdragon Mountain.” His previous arrogant
demeanor had completely vanished, leaving behind nothing but terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers in the
corner of the room just watched quietly. Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the stone door
swung open, and a woman walked in alongside a fur-clad youth. This
caused Dong Seven to feel even more uneasy. He didn’t recognize
these two at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess.” The
soldier on guard called out with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave,”
Yuchi Xiyue instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The soldier
immediately departed, and the stone door once more swung shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue and Ji Ning
both stared at the terrified, pathetic man bound atop the rack. These
two cousins had long ago repeatedly reviewed the intelligence reports
regarding Dong Seven. His appearance had been deeply engraved in both
their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Seven!”
Ning’s eyes flashed with coldness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was you. It was
you. It was you who destroyed my family, who killed my father and
caused my mother to die of depression as well.” Xiyue’s eyes
instantly turned red. She picked up a large ladle, filled with a
bubbling, hot silver liquid, then flicked it towards Dong Seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing silver
liquid splattered on Dong Seven’s body. Dong Seven instantly
emitted a miserable wail, and his neck stretched out as his agonized
cries rang out. His face was as white as paper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he somewhat came
back to his senses, he pitifully cried out, “Mercy, mercy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were red
as well. Everything…everything had been a result of this wayward,
hedonistic wastrel. This detestable person, this vile little creature
who he, Ji Ning, now only looked down upon! But this detestable
little creature had caused Ning’s parents as well as his cousin’s
parents to all die early on. A feud of familicide…he could not live
under the same skies with this man!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It hurts, it hurts!
Mercy!” Dong Qi screamed miserably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurts?” Ning
picked up a blazing branding iron-type magic treasure and walked
over. “That was just the start. Dong Seven, don’t be in such a
rush. Slowly enjoy this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no, no no no—!”
Dong Seven felt his own heart quiver. He began to scream miserably
once more…but protective formations covered this punishment room,
and no one outside could hear him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning heated up this
branding iron-type magic treasure, filling it with his elemental ki.
Instantly, a crackling sound could be heard as he pressed it down
against the tattered body of Dong Seven. Smoke and steam arose. After
he moved the branding iron away, he saw that Dong Seven’s skin now
had the diagram of a flame branded into it, a brand which quietly
activated the power of the natural world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHH!! It hurts, it
hurts!” Dong Seven’s entire body was quivering. That brand
diagram seemed to be causing his entire body to burn, and this
sensation of being burned to death repeatedly nearly caused him to
mentally collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Xiyue said
coldly, “Don’t worry. These are all instruments of punishment
used by the imperial clan of the Grand Xia. You’ve only tasted two
types so far. I won’t let you die that easily. I’ve prepared many
fine spirit-pills. I’ll heal you repeatedly and let you taste the
more than ten thousand types of corporal punishment the Grand Xia
Dynasty has to offer. I’ll let you learn what pain is, what regret
is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Seven, upon
hearing this, nearly broke down. Ten thousand types of punishment?
The first two had already nearly driven him to insanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How the hell did I
offend you two? What the hell did I do? You must have the wrong
person!” Dong Seven was almost crying now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the stone door
was once more pushed open. From outside padded in a large, snowy
white hound. The stone door then shut once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you still
recognize me?” Savagery was in the eyes of the Whitewater Hound as
he stared at Dong Seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitewater Hound?”
Dong Seven was stunned. Deep in his memories, a scene from decades
ago began to replay. A scene with a tall, muscular man and a loving
couple; the wife was pregnant and truly beautiful, with a rare and
noble aura. Her pregnancy just added a strange mystique to her
charm…and Dong Seven had been incredibly aroused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, he had ordered
Yu Dong and Shui Yi to make their moves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You remember now?”
Ning said coldly. “That couple back then…they were my mother and
father.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The one that was
killed by your group back then was my father.” Xiyue began to grow
even more crazed. Her father had absolutely doted on her when she was
a child. His wide, mountain-like shoulders…his loud laughter…his
repeated appearances in her dreams…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was her most beloved
father…and she had been her kind and gentle man…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xiyue both
stared at Dong Seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Seven felt
coldness in the bottom of his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was you who
killed Shui Yi and Yu Dong?” Dong Seven said quaveringly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “And now, it is time for you. The principal instigator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My cousin was far
too gentle; he simply used the Heartburner Art to torment those two.”
Xiyue was gnashing her teeth. “Those two died, so that’s that…but
as for you, the main culprit? I’m going to let you taste all of the
ten thousand-plus punishments the Grand Xia has to offer. When the
time comes for you to die, I will absorb your soul into the Furnace
of Despair. I am going to torture your soul, every day and every
night, for thousands of years…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Seven’s gaze
grew numb as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
nearby cousin. Although he felt tremendous hatred as well, and also
wanted to torture and shatter this man’s soul…compared to his
cousin, he was far off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, it’s
enough for you to torment his soul for ten days and ten nights,”
Ning sent mentally, his eyes red. “There’s no need for you to
steep your soul in hatred for thousands of years for the sake of this
piece of trash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Torturing Dong Seven
for thousands of years would also mean that Yuchi Xiyue would be
steeped in hatred for thousands of years. Torturing others was a form
of tormenting one’s self as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seeds of my
hatred are deep. Little brother, don’t worry about me.” Xiyue’s
gaze had become twisted from madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning had grown up,
he had been taught by his parents for more than ten years, then
taught by Immortal Diancai as well. He also had his good friend, Mu
Northson; thus, Ning’s inner heart had never become twisted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Xiyue,
however…after her parents had died, she had lived by herself and
suffered tremendously. She didn’t wish to think back to her days of
suffering, but even after being brought back by her maternal
grandfather to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, she remained
quite solitary. Only in front of her cousin would her heart feel
slightly warm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Seven died an
agonizing death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having been
tortured for three months and perishing, his soul was indeed drawn
into the ‘Furnace of Despair’ and tormented for more than another
month. In the end…it had been King Yan who intervened. Although
Princess Xiyue kept the Furnace of Despair on her own person at all
times, and although there was no way an ordinary person could kill a
soul that was located with a magic treasure…King Yan could. He
destroyed Dong Seven’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, spend more
time with Xiyue. She’s given vent to her hatred for nearly half a
year now; she should be about done. If she continues like this, then
she will completely lose herself to madness. Spend more time with
her; this will help her slowly begin to walk out from the grips of
hate.” King Yan personally chatted with Ning on this, and Ning
naturally memorized these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep autumn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the deepest reaches
of the skies above the imperial capital, there was a hazy gray void.
Whoosh…the dim gray void suddenly parted, revealing an enormous
corridor which was filled with a hazy golden light. A large number of
black soldiers flew out in columns, and behind them there was a group
of black-armored warriors that were riding on celestial horses.
Behind the riders, there was an enormous coiling black dragon whose
incomparably powerful aura filled the skies. It was pulling an
enormous Immortal carriage that emanated golden light. There were
golden lamps hanging from the Immortal carriage, and seated atop it
was a black-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black-robed man
had a plain, unassuming face. His eyes, however, seemed to hold
thunder within them. Wherever his gaze passed, the world itself
seemed about ready to split apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His might and prestige
caused the surrounding soldiers to feel absolute submission in their
trembling hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind this Immortal
carriage, there was a group of black-armored soldiers who were seated
obediently within a warship. This warship was three hundred meters
long, but it was much smaller than the Immortal carriage. It must be
understood that the black dragon was more than thirty kilometers
long…and the Immortal carriage was roughly the same size as the
black dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperor was out and
about, with 999 guards escorting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This squad flew
downwards, flying directly towards the Skylight Palace. Amidst the
clouds at the highest point of the Skylight Palace, a large group of
Immortal maidens and soldiers were already waiting. They all fell to
their knees. Each of them were at least at the Primal Daoist
level…but for them to be able to serve the Grand Xia Emperor was
their fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We bow to you, your
Imperial Majesty.” A muscular, two-headed Fiendgod was the first to
immediately kneel down and call out the words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the other
Immortal maidens and soldiers all knelt down as well. “We bow to
you, your Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black dragon pulled
the Immortal carriage downwards. The many black-armored soldiers that
were escorting the carriage all quickly separated, moving to stand in
different positions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
black-robed man left the Immortal carriage. With but two steps, he
arrived at the nearby imperial throne, then sat down. He looked
downwards at them from his position on high, then instructed, “Send
an order out to have King Qi come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
twin-headed Fiendgod immediately obeyed the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
continued to sit there on the throne. He swept his gaze forward,
seeming to stare through the layers of clouds and be able to inspect
everything within the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He sat there on high.
This was the Emperor of this major world…the one who had truly,
absolutely unified it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had set his
sights on the Three Realms long ago. He rarely came back to spend
time in this major world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few decades ago,
the Netherworld Kingdom of the Three Realms suffered an attack. The
Six Paths of Reincarnation were collapsed and destroyed…and then
the attackers suddenly vanished without a trace.” The black-robed
Emperor mused softly to himself, “The Netherworld…that is where
the souls of the Three Realms reside. How important it is! The
defenses there are very tight. The Yama-Kings of the Ten Halls and
the Lord of Cui Palace are all Pure Yang True Immortals, and each of
them are formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kshitigarbha 1, of
the Buddhist schools, stands guard there as well. The Netherworld has
some other ancient fellows there as well…it is a place of
tremendous power, but upon suffering a sneak attack, it wasn’t able
to fight back at all. In a very short period of time, the Six Paths
of Reincarnation were destroyed…and they haven’t even been able
to find out who caused it or where the attackers came from. Even
someone like Master was unable to find out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These forces which
lie in the shadows…they are terrifying powerful. And their very
first attack was against the Six Paths of Reincarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems…the Three
Realms are about to fall into a state of chaos.” The black-robed
Emperor had a look of deep worry within his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a tribulation came
for the Three Realms as a whole, it would be incredibly terrifying.
In the unfathomably ancient past, after Pangu established the world,
the first era had been the Primordial era. Afterwards, the Primordial
World had been shattered; only then had the three thousand major
worlds and the trillions of smaller worlds been created. From this,
one could tell how terrifying that storm had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single major
cataclysm will give birth to some truly supreme heroic figures.”
The black-robed Emperor stared downwards towards the imperial capital
of the Grand Xia. As the saying went, heroes were born in the midst
of chaos. All of the powerful figures of the Three Realms had been
born over the course of the truly major tribulations of the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be the
first Conclave of Immortal Destiny after the destruction of the Six
Paths of Reincarnation. Then…most likely, some of those heroic
figures that are going to emerge in this era will first appear in
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny,” the black-robed Emperor mused
to himself…
