Chapter 1 - Daolord Solesky
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a large ship that
was advancing through the emptiness of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” The raggedy
old man sat down in the lotus position, a table in front of him. The
table was covered with fruit and wine, and Ji Ning sat down in front
of the old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. I haven’t
introduced myself yet.” The raggedy old man smiled. “I’m one of
the three Palace Lords of Vastheaven Palace, ‘Daolord Solesky’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Palace Lords?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information which
World God Northrest had left behind indicated that Vastheaven Palace
only had two Palace Lords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All members of
Vastheaven Palace address each other as ‘brother’. There’s no
difference in status amongst us,” the raggedy old man explained.
“Anyone who can become a Samsara Daolord will be honored with the
title of ‘Palace Lord’. A short while ago, Vastheaven Palace gave
birth to a new Samsara Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was truly
incredible. Their organization had a total of three Daolords!
Vastheaven Palace truly was a thriving, powerful place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, you said
that it was Northrest who gave you the talisman of welcome. How
exactly did Northrest die?” A hint of a baleful aura began to
gather around the raggedy old Daolord Solesky. The members of
Vastheaven Palace showed extreme solidarity, especially since it was
extremely hard to join Vastheaven Palace in the first place. Every
single member of the Palace was extremely talented. World God
Northrest was on the same level of power as God Emperor Blacklotus,
and strictly speaking he was actually a bit more powerful. This was
because World God Northrest had trained in the [Nameless] sword-art.
When using it alongside Violetjewel, he was somewhat stronger than
even Blacklotus had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was slain by the
three Wujiao Godbeasts,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Them?” A cold
light flashed through Daolord Solesky’s eyes, then he closed them
and began to spread out his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky looked
just like an ordinary old beggar, but when he closed his eyes, a wave
of invisible power swept out from him that caused even Ning to feel a
sense of uncontrollable veneration towards the man. Prior to this,
Daolord Solesky had kept his aura completely suppressed, so as to
ensure that Ning wouldn’t feel any pressure from his presence at
all. Now, however…Ning felt the pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Daolord Solesky opened his eyes and nodded. “I’ve already sent
word to Vastheaven Palace. Both Warlord and I engaged in a bit of
divination. Those three Wujiao Godbeasts truly were the slayers of
Northrest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divination?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself had some
insights into the workings of fate, and was capable of seeing the
destinies of ordinary mortals and weak cultivators. Thus, he knew
exactly what Daolord Solesky meant! To use the power of divination to
calculate and identify the killer of Northrest was extremely
difficult, because there were many different streams of variables
which interfered with the workings of fate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, once they knew
that the killers were the three Wujiao Godbeasts, things were
different. They were able to use divination to calculate the actions
of both Northrest and the three Wujiao Godbeasts, making it millions
of times easier to come to the correct conclusion. Still, few
World-level experts would be capable of such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those three vile
creatures truly were audacious. How dare they scheme against one of
our brothers?” Daolord Solesky’s eyes flashed with cold light. “I
really wonder where the hell they got their courage from. Six of our
brothers from Vastheaven Palace have already set out after them.
Soon, those three vile creatures will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly sigh for the three Wujiao Godbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To plot against a
member of Vastheaven Palace was no easy feat. The slightest misstep
would spell certain doom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All those years ago,
the three Wujiao Godbeasts had successfully ambushed World God
Northrest, acquiring the treasures they wanted and forcing him to
flee while heavily injured. Despite their ‘success’, they risked
their own lives as they furiously chased after him, diving deep into
many dangerous areas! They did this precisely because they actually
were filled with tremendous terror regarding the possibility of
Vastheaven Palace finding out what they had done. If that
happened…given how powerful Vastheaven Palace was, they would be
easily wiped out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Vastheaven
Territory, Vastheaven Palace was the undisputed hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of its members were
extremely formidable, and some of their most powerful members
transcended even supreme World Gods in might. They were even stronger
than Northrest had been! Just one of those figures would be able to
easily slay all three of them. Even ‘ordinary’ members of
Vastheaven Palace would be more powerful than the three Godbeasts; if
several ‘ordinary’ members were sent out, they would have no
chance at all of surviving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, World God
Northrest was forced to flee into such a lethal death trap that even
his Eternal weapon was half-shattered! Only then was he able to throw
the three Wujiao Godbeasts off his trail. Thankfully, the
quintessence core of his Eternal weapon was extremely powerful,
allowing the remnants of his truesoul to hide within it. Alas, in the
end, he was unable to reverse or stop the process of his truesoul
breaking apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Why is my
lifeblood oath still active?” Ning frowned slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had sworn a
lifeblood oath to go to Vastheaven Palace and inform its Welcomer of
Northrest’s death within a chaos cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had now notified
Daolord Solesky, which meant that word had surely been spread to all
the members of Vastheaven Palace. In fact, several of the brothers
had already struck out for revenge. By all rights, the Welcomer
should have been informed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
immediately understood what was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The exact wording of
his lifeblood oath had been: “I swear on my very life itself that
within a thousand years of becoming an Elder God, I must leave the
Three Realms. I must reach ‘Vastheaven Palace’ within a chaos
cycle and inform a Welcomer of Vastheaven Palace that World God
Northrest was slain by the three Wujiao Godbeasts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wording of his
lifeblood oath specified that he had to physically reach Vastheaven
Palace within a chaos cycle. This was part of his oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that the
lifeblood oath will only dissipate after I actually reach Vastheaven
Palace,” Ning mused to himself. “Eh. I’m going there anyways.
No rush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Daolord
Solesky suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just call me big
brother Solesky,” Daolord Solesky said with a laugh. “In
Vastheaven Palace, people on the same level simply refer to each
other as ‘brother’. If someone is a level higher than you, you
should just refer to them as ‘big brother’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I spent
quite a bit of time rushing all the way from the Vastheaven Territory
to the Badlands Territory because there are two places in the
Badlands Territory I must visit,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two places in the
Badlands Territory?” Ning listened attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first place is
the Windsource Ruins,” Daolord Solesky said. “I was headed over
there, but halfway there I sensed your talisman of welcome. However,
I could also sense fate whispering to me that you weren’t in too
much danger, so I took my time and wasn’t in a rush to go find you.
Alas…if I had known what was happening, I would’ve travelled to
you at maximum speed. Perhaps I might’ve been able to save that
‘World God Blackmist’ fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t really
blame Daolord Solesky. Daolord Solesky had only really been focused
on Ning’s survival, after all; when he sensed that his brother Ning
wasn’t in too much danger, he naturally didn’t feel the need to
rush over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ship is heading
straight for the Windsource Ruins.” Daolord Solesky looked at Ning.
“The Windsource Ruins were established by Daolord Windsource.
Daolord Windsource was an absolutely incredible figure. He was every
bit my equal and he very nearly succeeded in his Daomerge. The
protective spells and formations he left behind to guard his estate
are quite troublesome. I really don’t want to risk them, but I have
to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that
apparently Daolord Solesky was just as strong as Daolord Windsource
had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before he died, he
laid out all of his insights into the ‘Hundred Streams of the
Windsource’,” Daolord Solesky said. “Once that formation is
activated, it’ll cause the entire Windsource Chaosworld to
completely blow apart. It will be as strong as a full-strength
desperation blow from Daolord Windsource!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I don’t
need to actually break his formation on this trip. All I need to do
is enter the core region and acquire a certain treasure,” Daolord
Solesky said. “Despite that, it’ll still be dangerous. If you are
going with me…I recommend you either stay in my estate-world or
wait for me outside the Windsource Ruins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said hurriedly,
“Big brother Solesky, is there a relatively safe location inside
the Ruins that you can take me to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had dared to
adventure through the Ruins by himself. Now that he had a Daolord by
his side, what did he have to fear?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it.”
Daolord Solesky rather admired Ning’s adventurous spirit. “That
place is divided into an outer region, an inner region, and a core
region. I’m headed to the core region. If you come with me, I’ll
find a relatively safe place inside the core region for you and set
up a perimeter for you. No matter what, you are not permitted to
leave that area!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No kidding. The core
region was the most terrifying place in the entire Windsource Ruins.
If he ran about randomly within it, he would essentially be treating
his own life as a joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Daolord
Solesky nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours later,
Daolord Solesky and Ning arrived at the Windsource Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. Samsara Daolords travelled much more quickly than Ning
himself could…and this was supposedly a slow, leisurely pace for
Daolord Solesky. He would probably move much faster when time really
mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Windsource Ruins
are right over there. I actually went there before, once. Ning
pointed at a wide region covered by fogs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ruins…”
Daolord Solesky stood there in the sky, staring downwards at the vast
Windsource Ruins. A rather complicated look was on his face. He
sighed, “He made it to the very last step. All he needed to do was
complete his final step and merge his Hundred Streams into the
Dao…but in the end, he failed. Knowing that he was about to die and
his Dao was about to vanish, he decided to leave these Ruins behind
to let people in the future know that a person named Windsource once
existed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?” Ning
looked towards Daolord Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah! My Daomerge
is coming. Recently, I’ve developed a habit of thinking about all
sorts of random things.” Daolord Solesky shook his head and
laughed. “I’m much luckier than Windsource was, and my Dao is
stronger than his was as well. Ahaha! Come, come! Follow me inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
immediately led Ning to charge downwards into the clouds below.

Chapter 2 - Sword-Ki Island
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Windsource
Ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky and Ji
Ning stood in the air, the area around them filled with streams of
gray energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uhh…” Daolord
Solesky stared at the streams of gray energy swirling in the skies.
Every single stream of energy came out of great crevices within the
earth, intermingled with the other streams of gray energy in the air,
then plunged back down into a different crevice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. Daolord
Windsource was quite a legend, and it seems he had the power to match
his reputation.” Daolord Solesky stared at the many criss-crossing
streams of gray energy in the skies. “A pity that my path is
completely different from his. Otherwise, I’d burrow into the
ground and spend some time getting a clear look of the Hundred
Streams of the Windsource.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood next to
him, not understanding any of this. It had been one of those streams
of gray energy that had pulled him into one of the deep abysses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” Ning
pointed towards a pool of water below them, then said, “When I last
entered the Windsource Ruins, I accidentally encountered a little
house by that lake. The house held a deceased World God and a
tower-shaped Eternal treasure he had.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Eternal
treasure?” Daolord Solesky glanced downwards, two streams of golden
light shooting out of his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, nothing there.
There’s no house.” Daolord Solesky shook his head. “The Hundred
Streams of the Windsource are constantly changing. The house you
encountered last time could well be ten million kilometers away by
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
wouldn’t mind taking away an Eternal weapon if there was no effort
involved, but alas it wasn’t there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Daolord Solesky shook his head. “When Daolord Windosurce died, many
of his World Gods died with him, but only four or five of them held
Eternal weapons. All of them are scattered throughout the Ruins, and
I’m not able to break apart the formation protecting this place.
All I can do is try my luck, but I could spend thousands of years
without finding one of the Eternal weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed with this
analysis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky himself
had said earlier that when the Hundred Streams of the Windsource
Formation unleashed its full might, it would be tremendously
powerful. Quite a few Daolords, such as Daolord Waterwind or Daolord
Badlands, had visited this place before, but all of them acted with
great caution. None of them tried to actually breach the formation!
This was a formation which Daolord Windsource had poured all of his
heart, soul, power, and Dao into as he lay on the verge of death.
When the formation was activated, it would possess as much power as
Daolord Windsource himself did when engaging in a last-ditch final
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t be
afraid of fighting Daolord Windsource himself, but…” Daolord
Solesky laughed. “Because he was dying, he poured everything he had
into this formation. I don’t want to take on an explosive,
full-strength from the thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
core regions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky led
Ning as they continued to fly forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t try to
breach the formation or bypass it. Instead he followed its natural
flows, resulting in them slowly moving closer and closer towards the
core regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Before them
were countless gusts of gray wind. The further they advanced, the
more powerful the wind was and the more gusts of them appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood by Daolord
Solesky’s side, but he still couldn’t help but feel nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense that if
he was by himself here, he would be completely ground apart into tiny
pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all some
of Windsource’s killer techniques, but those powerful enough can
easily go through them without harm. In fact, they’ll actually form
a giant corridor.” Daolord Solesky laughed as he led them through
the gray wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before them were a
series of islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are now in a core
region,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is so beautiful
here.” Ning saw a large lake that was thousands of kilometers long.
In the center of the lake was a single large island surrounded by
more than ten smaller islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be fooled by
appearances. This place is extremely dangerous.” Two streams of
golden light shot out from Daolord Solesky’s eyes as he surveyed
the region. “The island in the center is the place where Daolord
Windsource used to live. The surrounding islands should be places
where his disciples and servants lived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning swept
the area with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single island
emanated ripples of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some emanated ripples
of electric.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some emanated ripples
of frost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some emanated ripples
of a bloody aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One island had an aura
of sword-ki at its center that soared into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the central
island where Daolord Windsource had lived, that island emanated
multiple rings of ripples. It was as though this island was
generating a omnidirectional wind that gently rippled out in waves.
In fact, when the wind reached them Daolord Solesky didn’t move to
block it, allowing it to gently blow across them. The feeling was
quite comfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for some
reason, whenever Ning looked at the central island his heart was
filled with a sense of fear. “That old bastard.” Daolord Solesky
stared intently at the central island, his eyes glowing with golden
light as he mumbled to himself, “He died, but he wanted to make
sure that it wouldn’t be easy for others to acquire his treasures
without paying a price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be able to
take you inside, and I won’t be able to protect you once I go
inside.” Daolord Solesky glanced at Ning. “There are quite a few
islands around the big one. Just pick one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a surge of
joy. He actually didn’t want to go to the central island. It was
too dangerous! If he went inside, he would probably die without even
realizing what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
glanced at the small islands before turning to focus on the one which
was emanating a towering aura of sword energy. “That one, I
suppose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that all of
the World-level experts here had died, which meant that the treasures
they had left behind were all ownerless. Ownerless treasures would
naturally emanate ripples of tremendous power…and a treasure which
emanated such towering ripples of sword energy was bound to be an
extraordinary one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That one?” Daolord
Solesky turned his golden gaze towards that island. That island had
an Immortal estate built atop it, and it was from this place that the
sword-ki was emanating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you should
have the Eternal weapon which Northrest owned, right?” Daolord
Solesky looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. When I saw you
defend against those black lotuses, I could sense that you were quite
strong. That’s why I suspected that you were probably using his
‘Violetjewel’.” Daolord Solesky nodded. “Since you have
Violetjewel…although that island is filled with danger, you should
be able to handle it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Filled with danger?”
Ning was secretly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. That island
holds three deceased World-level experts.” Daolord Solesky laughed.
“The treasures they left behind aren’t bad. They are a good fit
for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three?” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. No matter
what, don’t move as much as a single step off of that island.”
Daolord Solesky said solemnly, “If you touch or activate part of
the formations here, you’ll instantly be reduced to dust. I won’t
have any chance to save you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then go.” Daolord
Solesky waved his hand, causing a stream of watery light to
immediately surrounding Ning and send him flying towards the small
island at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed atop a
grassy patch of land. He hurriedly raised his head to stare at the
skies, where he saw Daolord Solesky smile and nod towards him. “Just
wait here for me on this island.” Daolord Solesky then immediately
transformed into a formless stream of water that flew straight
towards the large central island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ripples of gentle
wind surrounding transformed into ripples of incredibly sharp golden
wind that could cut through anything. However, that stream of water
was durable and formless; even after being chopped apart, it seeped
through the wind and reformed, easily bypassing the barrier and
entering the central island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning saw Daolord
Solesky transform into a stream of water and sensed the terrifying
power of the golden wind emanating from the central island, he was
once more reminded of the huge gap in power that existed between him
and them. They were on completely different levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still very
weak.” Ning turned his head to look at the island he was on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island he was on
was a few dozen kilometers in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island was filled
with beautiful flowers and lovely trees, as well as a few small
hills. The Immortal estate was located at the very center and was
quite dazzling to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that where the
three World-level experts are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky
told me that although this place is filled with danger, I can handle
it.” Ning stretched out his hand, causing Violetjewel to appear
within it. The azureflower mist energy began to fill his body as
well, further strengthening it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully walked
forward, arriving before the Immortal estate within a few seconds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The doors to the palace
were open. It was completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning cautiously
advanced through the estate, he could sense how deathly still the
entire place was. At the same time, the hallways were all extremely
clean and tidy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nobody here at all?”
As Ning walked forward, he saw that the entire place was completely
empty. There weren’t even any corpses to be seen. Ning tested out
using his coresense and heartforce to scan the place, but the entire
region hummed with a gentle wind that blocked out everything. Daolord
Solesky was able to scan the place, but clearly Ning was far too weak
to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Just as Ning
was wondering why there was nobody to be seen here, his eyes suddenly
lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw a small
mountain off in the distance located just outside the walls of the
palace. Midway up the mountain, there was a little pavilion, and
there was a golden-robed figure seated in the lotus position within
the pavilion.

Chapter 3 - Stone Titan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that the first World-level expert would actually be located
outside of the estate.” Ji Ning hopped over the wall, then walked
up the mountain. The golden-robed figure seated within the distant
pavilion looked as though he was alive. He had a long beard, a
peaceful face, and emanated faint ripples of a Chaos Immortal’s
energy. However, no signs of actual life could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword energy
emanating from this island doesn’t come from him.” Ning turned to
glance backwards at the Immortal estate. The sword energy was
emanating from deep within the immortal estate itself. Ning had spent
some time wandering it, but had been careful to stay in the outer
regions of the estate. He hadn’t gone deeper inside of it yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If even someone like
Daolord Solesky described this place as being ‘filled with danger’,
how could Ning possibly dare to take it lightly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
walked to the pavilion, then clasped his hands as he stood outside of
it. “I’ll take the treasures you left behind, but I’ll also
give you a proper burial to ensure that you won’t be disturbed
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as his words
finished…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. An aura of
power suddenly burst forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
He hurriedly retreated at high speed, then turned to stare at the
place where the aura was coming from. There were many boulders on
this mountain, and an enormous boulder was located right next to the
pavilion. Ning hadn’t paid it too much attention, but this boulder
was now emanating an aura of power that vastly outstripped Ning
himself. In fact, Ning had the feeling that it was even more powerful
than most World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The boulder
melted into liquid, then reformed anew, transforming to an enormous
stone titan. The stone titan had dark yellow eyes and his entire body
was formed from stone, and he was staring straight at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golem?” Ning
carefully reached out with his senses. Although this stone titan had
an aura of tremendous power, it didn’t have an aura of life; all it
had was an aura of energy. It was a construct or a magic treasure of
some sort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Elder God?” The
stone titan’s voice rumbled. “Puny Elder God. It is good that you
chose to show respect to your seniors. If you dared to desecrate my
master’s corpse, I would’ve smashed you into a thousand pieces
already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood. This stone titan had to be some sort of construct which
the deceased Chaos Immortal had created long ago. The Chaos Immortal
hadn’t chosen to destroy the golem; instead, he had allowed the
golem to stay by his corpse’s side and guard him for all these
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this senior was
your master?” Ning said with curiosity, “I imagine you must’ve
been trapped on this island for a long, long time. Don’t you want
to leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you care?”
The stone titan looked at Ning. “You wish to bamboozle me into
accepting you as my new master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, but in his
heart he felt rather embarrassed. This golem wasn’t created through
a grafted soul and instead had an artificial golem spirit, but it was
quite intelligent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
intelligent beings who were by themselves for a long period of time
would want to leave a place like this. For example, the
treasure-spirit of the Eternal-level tower which Ning had encountered
in the house by the lake wished to leave the Ruins. Ning could tell
that this powerful golem, which had an aura that was mightier than
that of most World-level experts, was extremely tough to deal with.
Wouldn’t it be nice if Ning could convince the golem to join him
and accept him as its new master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, Ning was
mistaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golem was
fashioned from a type of marvelous ore, and the golem spirit that had
emerged from it had a stony personality as well. The golem enjoyed
peace and quiet and was perfectly happy with staying in one place
without moving for countless years on end. He had taken the shape of
a giant boulder and guarded its master’s corpse for countless years
without fail. If Ning hadn’t come, he would’ve continued to
remain in that form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I wish you to
accept me as your master.” Ning nodded and smiled. “You should be
a World-level golem. To leave you here is a complete waste of your
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were quite
respectful to my master, so I’ll give you a chance.” The stone
titan nodded. “Since you are just a puny little Elder God, I won’t
make it too hard for you. If you can withstand three of my
palm-strikes, I’ll accept you as my new master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan still
remembered the final words of his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had known
that death was nigh. Before dying, he had said, “After I die, if
there are any outsiders who come and act with great respect and
propriety, you may follow him after testing him and verifying that he
is strong. But if any would act to defile my corpse, slay them! If
you cannot slay them, dive into the lake. If they dare to follow you
into the lake, they shall surely perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
cultivators who would ransack and defile the corpses of deceased
seniors. Any of those who came here would be in trouble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three palms of
mine won’t be too powerful, but there aren’t many Elder Gods who
can withstand them. Weak Elder Gods aren’t qualified to be my
master. Be careful!” The stone titan looked at Ning. Ning was an
Elder God, which was why the stone titan was only going to strike
three times. If Ning was a World-level expert, the golem would be
fighting with full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan
suddenly struck out with his enormous, pillar-like arms. His arms
stretched out to become many dozens of meters long as his giant palms
came crashing down towards Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast!” Ning was
secretly startled. He unleashed his flexible sword, causing it to
transform into a black hole that immediately entangled the stone
palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took one step
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, Ning was
doing this on purpose. With the azureflower mist energy strengthening
him, his body was as tough as any World God’s body. He easily
could’ve stood there without needing to take a step back at all.
However, Ning was afraid that this might rouse the golem’s fighting
spirit, resulting in the next two palms becoming much more powerful.
Taming this golem was what really mattered right now; after he became
the golem’s master, there would be plenty of time for the two of
them to spar. A World-level golem was far more valuable than most Dao
weapons; if any danger appeared, Ning could allow the golem to stand
in front and protect him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you have a bit of
power.” The stone titan let out a growl. “Try out my second
palm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone palm easily
broke past the speed of light as it instantly appeared before Ning.
It was clearly much faster than the previous blow, and as the giant
stone palm appeared Ning felt as though the entire world was growing
dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!! Yet another
massive explosion rang out from the collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning took
three steps backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The stone
titan frowned at this, and a ‘frown’ appearing on a giant stone
face was actually quite an amusing sight. The stone titan had thought
that this palm of his would smash the Elder God and send him flying
all the way back to the walls of the Immortal palace…but instead,
the Elder God had only taken three steps back. Clearly, the man was
holding back some of his true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Final palm!” The
stone titan let out a growl, sending his palm down towards Ning in an
even more brutal strike. This palm-strike was so fierce that space
itself was being crushed in on itself and came slamming towards Ning
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this!”
This time, Ning used his Eternal weapon Violetjewel. He unleashed his
most powerful strike!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! It was time for
the ‘Heavenbreaker’ stance. Ning lifted Violetjewel up high,
transforming it to become three hundred meters long, then chopped
down furiously towards the stone titan. It was already the third
palm, and so Ning felt that it was time to show the stone titan his
real power. He wanted to show the stone titan that he was not a ‘puny
Elder God’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh!?” The stone
titan was caught off-guard. The power of the blow which Ning had just
unleashed caused him to feel shocked. His palm had been crashing
downwards towards Ning, but now he hurriedly angled it upwards to
block Ning’s attack instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A head-on, frontal
collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light smashed
directly downwards against the giant stone palm, causing the stone
titan to sink downwards into the ground. Even the mountain itself
trembled slightly. However, this island had been constructed by
Daolord Windsource; World-level experts would often spar in these
islands but were unable to truly damage it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he was
driven quite a few steps backwards by the shockwave generated through
this exchange of blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power. I caught him off-guard and he only used one hand to block, but
he was still able to knock me backwards. In raw strength alone, he
vastly surpasses me,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve received all
three of your palm-strikes,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan stared
at Ning. Puzzled, he asked, “You…you ARE an Elder God, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t you tell
from the aura?” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But your power…I
feel as though you are comparable to some of the World Gods I’ve
met in the past.” The stone titan stared at Ning, feeling quite
curious. “There are legends of some Elder Gods who can defeat World
Gods. I think you should be able to defeat some of the weakest World
Gods…but don’t get smug. I treated you as an Elder God and so I
didn’t strike with full force. Otherwise, I would’ve smacked you
flying with a single hit. I was afraid if I hit you too hard, I’d
send you flying off the island and get you killed by the formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had noticed earlier
that the attacks of the stone titan had all come from the same
direction. From this direction, even if Ning had been sent flying, he
would’ve merely smashed against the Immortal palace. But of course,
if he was hit too hard, it was still possible that he would’ve
bounced off the Immortal palace and been knocked off the island
regardless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you remember what
you promised just now?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My previous master
was a master of formations.” The stone titan glanced at the
golden-robed figure within the pavilion. “I didn’t expect that my
new master would be an Elder God with the power of a World God.” He
opened his mouth, causing a fist-sized globe that was covered with
countless divine runes to fly towards Ning, coming to a halt before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
recognized it. This was the life-core of a golem which contained its
formation-diagram. This was the core of the entire golem; upon
binding it, he would become capable of controlling it.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s Elder God
energy flew out, surrounding the life-core and quickly binding it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After binding it, Ning
could sense the intimate connection that now existed between him and
the golem. The golem was now completely under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A World-level golem.
This is far rarer than a Dao weapon.” Ning was in an excellent
mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The stone
titan now had a much friendlier look in his eyes as he looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. What’s your
name?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My previous master
just called me Rocky,” the stone titan said honestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. A
World-level golem was actually named ‘Rocky’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, I’ll keep
calling you Rocky as well.” Ning nodded, then turned towards the
golden-robed corpse. Ning waved his hand, causing the golden-robed
corpse and the stone titan to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s estate
world. This was a place filled with endless mountain ranges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had sent one of
his divine power incarnations to accompany the stone titan in
travelling through this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I encounter
certain deceased Immortals and Fiendgods in my travels, I’ll
generally bury them here.” Ning pointed at a distant mountain which
held a graveyard filled with many tombstone, each tombstone quite
large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open up.” Ning
pointed at a verdant mountain in front of them. Rumble…the mountain
began to split apart. Moments later, the golden-robed corpse flew
into the mountain crevice. The mountain then reformed, a new
tombstone appearing at its very peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was your
previous master’s name?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Immortal
Origination,” the stone titan rumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. A total of
seven words immediately appeared on the surface of the tombstone:
“The burial site of Chaos Immortal Origination.” The stone titan
stared at the lush mountain for a moment, then rumbled softly, “Let
us leave, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pavilion on the
mountain in the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Origination
didn’t have any Dao armor?” Ning began to bind Immortal
Origination’s treasures and carefully sift through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Origination
placed all of his time and energy into his golems. He never engaged
in close combat against foes,” the stone titan said. “His most
important treasures were the ‘Ninehearts Heavenloop Formation’
and a domain-type artifact known as the ‘Rainbow Cloud World’.
Both can be considered top-grade Dao weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
inspections, Ning was quite excited by what he had just found. He now
possessed an enormous number of chaos jewels! Immortal Origination
had stored up roughly fifty cubes worth of chaos jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninehearts
Heavenloop Formation was his most powerful formation. Once he used
it, no enemy would dare to move close to him. Once they entered the
sphere of the formation, it would be almost impossible for them to
break free from it. It was completely up to him whether or not he
wished to keep fighting or to flee,” the stone titan said.
“However, the formation is an incredibly complicated one. Only
someone with incredible talent in the art of formations is capable of
using it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the nine loops to appear before him. Every single loop was
filled with countless divine runes that were much more complicated
than even the formation-diagram located in the stone titan’s core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan had
been personally created by Immortal Origination. This Ninehearts
Heavenloop Formation, however, was a Dao weapon that had been
fashioned by a Samsara Daolord. It was naturally much more profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is too
complicated. I can’t use it.” Ning shook his head then waved his
hand again, causing a pearl to appear within it. This pearl was
brimming with a strange mist that swirled around it. Ning smiled.
“This is better for me. Domain-type Dao weapons are quite rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Immortal
Origination didn’t have many treasures, the ones he did have were
all exquisite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninehearts
Heavenloop Formation was a set of nine loops that were worth more
than a hundred cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan Rocky
was also worth more than a hundred cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rainbow Cloud World
was a domain-type treasure that was incredibly rare and worth more
than fifty cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then there was the
enormous amount of chaos jewels!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Origination
really had a lot of chaos jewels.” Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He focused on the
art of formations and the art of constructs. He naturally had to
prepare many chaos jewels to keep them powered,” the stone titan
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help protect me for
a time. I need to spend a bit of time in cultivation,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
stone titan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavengazer Tower
of Radiance appeared next to him. Ning stepped into the tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position. He waved his hand, causing thousands of chaos jewels
to appear, all of them brimming with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t let all
these chaos jewels go to waste. My protective divine ability isn’t
really cutting it any longer. If I just slowly train it on its own,
even if I use the Heavengazer Tower it’ll take me tens of thousands
of years to master it,” Ning mused to himself. “Since I’ve
gained such a great fortune, I might was well be a bit extravagant
and break through my current bottleneck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
mastered the upper portion of the [Golden Idol] when he was in the
Three Realms, resulting in a divine body that was comparable to a
top-grade Protocosmic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been working
on the middle portion of the [Golden Idol] ever since he had become
an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability was
actually a very simple one. All it needed was energy. Divine power,
Immortal energy, chaos energy, spirit-pills…it accepted all types
of energy. Ning had started with complete mastery over the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and so was able to use its energy to easily
master the upper portion. The middle portion, however, was much more
complicated…but it allowed for the cultivator to make his body
comparable to a top-grade Chaos treasure. The amount of energy it
required was correspondingly great as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning continued to
simply train slowly, he would need roughly a million years before he
was able to master this technique. Even when using the Heavengazer
Tower to save time, he would still need tens of thousands of years.
Ning had indeed been preparing to spend that time slowly cultivating,
because if he wanted to rely on the energy of chaos jewels or chaos
nectar he would need to spend dozens of cubes worth of energy. This
price was far too high! Even most World Gods would rather spend
twenty or thirty thousand years cultivating rather than pay such an
enormous price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos jewels and chaos
nectar were used like currency in the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar’s
advantage lay in its quality! It was incredibly marvelous and could
be used in many ways. Many divine abilities, secret arts, pill-making
techniques, and protective spells needed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos jewels’
advantage lay in energy quantity! They were jewels that were
naturally formed through a crystallization of chaos energy, which
meant that every single chaos jewel held an enormous amount of chaos
energy within it. Powerful formations and powerful golems all
required chaos jewels to be used as their energy sources. Chaos
jewels had many uses as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to break
through this bottleneck as quickly as I can. If I do so, I’ll stand
a better chance of surviving any future dangers. Although big brother
Solesky said that I should be able to handle the dangers here,
nothing is absolute. Best to be safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing a chaos jewel to fly into his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then sat there in
the lotus position, drawing out an enormous amount of chaos energy
into his body from the chaos jewel. His divine body began to
transform, and Ning’s skin began to emanate a faint golden light…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having used up
nineteen chaos jewels, Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. My body has
broken through to the Chaos treasure level. I’ll pause here for
now. When I go to the outside world and have some more free time,
I’ll finish the process.” Ning had spent hundreds of years slowly
drawing in energy, resulting in him reaching a bottleneck. Within the
Heavengazer Tower, he was able to cause time to flow fifty times
faster than in the outside world, resulting in his body eventually
breaking through to the Chaos level. Although this used up quite a
bit of energy, Ning wasn’t worried about the cost in chaos jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared within
the pavilion once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The stone
titan looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky, there should
have been two other World-level experts on this island, right?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The stone
titan pointed at the other distant islands. “There are twelve
islands surrounding Daolord Windsource’s residence. These islands
housed his twelve disciples as well as some servants.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve disciples?”
Ning was startled. “What of this island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three
World-level experts who resided on this island were World God
Cavecry, Chaos Immortal Bloodpool, and Chaos Immortal Origination.
World God Cavecry was the Daolord’s disciple while Immortal
Origination and Immortal Bloodpool were responsible for serving World
God Cavecry,” the stone titan said. “World God Cavecry was far
more powerful than Immortal Origination and Immortal Bloodpool.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s curiosity had
been aroused. “World God Cavecry was Daolord Windsource’s
disciple. Was he ordered to accompany his master into death as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciples who
were summoned here were all the ones he didn’t really like. The
Daolord was a strange man with a strange personality. If he didn’t
acknowledge and respect you, you would die with him,” the stone
titan said. “However, Daolord Windsource still bestowed a painting
upon World God Cavecry. I still remember what the Daolord said to him
when giving him the painting. ‘If you can comprehend and master
this painting, you’ll be be given your freedom and allowed to
leave.’ Alas, World God Cavecry didn’t manage to master it before
his death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, Daolord
Windsource gave all twelve of these disciples a chance to live. The
problem was that he gave them extremely harsh tests that were far too
difficult for them. I don’t think any of the twelve managed to
live,” the stone titan said.

Chapter 5 - The Underground Hallway
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan said
hurriedly, “These twelve disciples were not favored by the Daolord
and weren’t acknowledged by him. However, although the Daolord had
a rather strange temperament, he would still work hard to cultivate
and rear powerful subordinates. Thus, the stronger ones were all
expelled and driven away once the Daolord returned to his home. The
ones who were required to follow him to this place were the ones who
didn’t have much potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t have much
potential?” Ning immediately asked, “Did World God Cavecry have
an Eternal weapon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He did not.” The
stone titan shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a bit of
disappointment. When he had heard that the lord of this island was
World God Cavecry, who had two Chaos Immortals serving him, he had
thought that Cavecry had to be a truly incredible figure. Who
would’ve thought that he didn’t have so much as a single Eternal
weapon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal weapons are
extremely valuable. Not even Daolords can just toss them around
casually, and the Daolord preferred for his disciples to adventure
for their treasures rather than just wait for him to hand them out,”
the stone titan said. “Based on what I know, only nine of the
Daolord’s disciples had Eternal weapons. Most of them acquired them
on their own. The Daolord doted dearly on his first disciple and his
second disciple, and he only bestowed Eternal weapons upon the two of
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of the twelve
disciples who accompanied him in death had Eternal weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, quite a few
of his hundreds of slaves had Eternal weapons. They had acquired
those weapons by chance as they had accompanied the Daolord in his
adventures,” the stone titan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t feel
disappointed, Master.” The stone titan said hurriedly, “As I
recall, before World God Cavecry died he would often spend his time
staring at that painting. My master said that painting is equal to an
Eternal weapon in value.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Painting?” Ning
suddenly remembered that Daolord Windsource had bestowed a painting
upon World God Cavecry, promising to release him if Cavecry was able
to comprehend it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…World God
Cavecry was unable to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you familiar
with the palace?” Ning pointed at the Immortal estate before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. Follow
me, Master,” the stone titan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan shrank
down to a size of three meters, then walked down the mountain
alongside Ning and entered the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you must be
careful. World God Cavecry was a cruel, narrow-minded, vicious man
who was exceedingly selfish,” the stone titan warned. “Even
though he knew he was going to die, he still didn’t wish for others
to be able to acquire his treasures. His extreme selfishness was the
true reason why Daolord Windsource disliked him. Early on, he
improved incredibly fast as a cultivator, and so the Daolord held
high hopes for him. However, later on he stopped improving. Given how
selfish he was…the Daolord ended up choosing him to be one of the
twelve to accompany him in death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as he
gripped Violetjewel carefully in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He spent most of his
time within the underground study, focusing on the painting,” the
stone titan said. “Daolord Windsource’s death came suddenly. As a
result, World God Cavecry died in that underground study, and his
corpse remains there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Daolord Windsource
died, his twelve disciples and many servants all died as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The servants and
disciples all knew that his death was impending, but none of them
knew exactly when it would occur. There was of course no way that
Daolord Windsource himself could send them a mental message warning
them that he was about to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan led the
way, pushing aside a stone wall in a practiced manner and revealing a
stairway leading downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan walked
in front while Ning walked behind him. The two advanced down the
stairway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was fortunate for
Ning that the stone titan was very familiar with the Immortal estate.
Otherwise, given how he couldn’t even scan the place with coresense
or heartforce, it would’ve been extremely difficult for Ning to
locate the door behind that wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Master. We
are now very close to that private study. There might be danger,”
the stone titan said as they advanced through the dark hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
remained on high alert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underground hallway
was extremely dark, with just the divine runes etched into the sides
of the corridor providing a dim amount of flickering light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan and
Ning continued their advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here, Master!”
When they reached a turn, the stone titan suddenly sent a mental
message to Ning. At a time like this, the stone titan was quite
cautious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning silently moved to
stand next to the stone titan and peered down the hallway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure in
blood-colored robes was seated on the ground, slumped against the
walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was Immortal
Bloodpool.” The stone titan sent mentally to Ning, “Immortal
Bloodpool was probably walking through this hallway when his truesoul
was suddenly extinguished, which is why he is half-sitting,
half-slumping.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning felt
a bit of eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Origination
had quite a few treasures on him. What did Immortal Bloodpool have?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look
first, Master.” The stone giant stepped forwards. As a golem, his
task was to charge forward and absorb the blows as the vanguard. His
body was comparable to a Dao weapon in strength; he would be able to
withstand even a blow from most Samsara Daolords! His ability to stay
alive was far greater than that of almost any World-level expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when the stone
titan was unable to discover any danger around Immortal Bloodpool’s
corpse did Ning step forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Bloodpool was
quite handsome, but his robes and his hair were all blood-colored,
giving him a rather evil aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, causing Immortal Bloodpool’s body to be drawn into his
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After inspecting the
man’s possessions, Ning found a few pleasant surprises. Although
Immortal Bloodpool had slightly fewer treasures than Immortal
Origination did, the difference wasn’t that great…and one
treasure was particularly useful to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A suit of Dao
armor.” Ning waved his hand, causing a glittery suit of silverscale
armor to appear in his hands. This was most likely a high-grade Dao
armor of tremendous worth. The Fogstone Dominion only gave the
generals of the Fogstone Army suits of top-grade Chaos armor, while
the Blacklotus Emperor didn’t even give the Mindlord or his other
generals such precious equipment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Armor was incredibly
rare and expensive! Even a ‘mere’ high-grade Dao armor was worth
more than a hundred cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodcloud Seat,
Five Elements Bloodflame Needles.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Bloodpool had
a total of three sets of Dao treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armor was worth
over a hundred cubes of chaos nectar. However, there was no way Ning
would be willing to sell it. He focused on close combat and was in
dire need of such a strong suit of armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodcloud Seat was
an extremely bloodthirsty type of Dao weapon that was worth more than
fifty cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Elements
Bloodflame Needles were a set of five needles that were also worth
more than fifty cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning quickly
bound the suit of armor to himself and put it on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now had a suit of
Dao armor protecting his body, and his body was itself comparable to
a Chaos treasure. Ning could now withstand even a full-force blow
from an elite World God. But of course, although Ning could
‘withstand’ such a blow, he would still be easily captured and
then killed in other ways. Naturally, Ning wouldn’t be so foolish
as to actually get into a real fight against an elite World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
after we leave this place, I’ll have to find an opportunity to sell
off these treasures,” Ning mused to himself. Ning had no use to the
treasures which Immortal Origination and Immortal Bloodpool had loved
the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep going forwards,
Rocky,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
stone titan advanced fearlessly. A short while later, he came to a
halt. He then stretched out with his massive hands and pushed at a
section of the wall. That section of the wall looked plain and
ordinary, but when he pushed at the section it immediately swung
open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God Cavecry is
inside there,” the stone titan sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
immediately walked to the entranceway and stared into the study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The private study was
quite large. It was completely silent here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed figure
was seated in the lotus position, an enormous banner placed behind
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ripples of divine
power emanating from the black-robed man’s corpse were indeed that
of a deceased World God. He was facing a wall which was covered by a
painting, and the painting was the most eye-catching thing in the
entire study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire scroll
emanated a towering aura of sword energy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword energy filled
the entire study. In fact, it was so powerful that it went through
the entire Immortal palace and soared high into the heavens. Ning and
Daolord Solesky had both been immediately able to discover the sword
energy soaring out of this particular island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the sword-ki came
from this painting.” Ning stared at the painting. Because the
banner behind World God Cavecry partially blocked his vision, he was
only able to see that it appeared to be a painting of mountains and
rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I enter,
Master?” The stone titan knew that he shouldn’t act rashly at a
time like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, but be
careful,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan
carefully crept into the study, walking towards the seated
black-robed corpse. When he was roughly thirty meters away from the
black-robed corpse, circles of divine runes suddenly began to
manifest around corpse. The divine runes glowed with dazzling,
beautiful light, forming an enormous hemisphere of light that
surrounded and protected the corpse. Even the faintly glowing runes
located on the walls of the corridor began to grow dramatically
brighter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying power
suddenly burst forth. Ning was only able to use his sword to block
from one direction, while the omnidirectional burst of power struck
at his body from every other direction…
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - A Clean Sweep
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying shockwave
blasted out towards Ji Ning from every direction. Although the brunt
of it was blocked by his armor, some of the power still made it
through to assault Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s legs were
slightly flexed as he stood there in a stable position. He took a
deep breath, then glanced at his surroundings. The divine runes that
had been flickering on the walls had turned dim. A few aftershocks of
power continued to swirl through the corridor, but they were
incapable of posing any danger to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So World God Cavecry
actually prepared a nasty trick like this. What a nasty fellow. If a
Chaos Immortal encountered this trap, he probably would’ve died,”
Ning murmured softly. The power of that formation was as strong as a
frontal blow from a World God. Still, given Ning’s power, even if
he was still just wearing his previous set of top-grade Chaos armor
he still wouldn’t have been in any trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone with a strong
divine body would’ve been able to withstand this blow. Only
physically weak Ki Refiners would’ve been slain by it, most likely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky.” Ning
stepped into the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan had
been blasted into the room and against one of the walls. He had now
regained his footing as well and he said in a rumbling voice, “I’m
fine, Master. World God Cavecry really was a nasty piece of work. He
probably set this formation up in secret. Even I didn’t know about
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
turned to glance at the private study. The private study was roughly
three hundred meters in size, and the black-robed figure remained
seated in the lotus position in the center of it. That enormous
banner remained placed directly behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flutter. Flutter.
Streams of black energy swirled around the enormous banner as
Fiendgod-like figures began to fly out from it. The creatures that
flew out of the banner had human-shaped upper bodies but lower bodies
of mist and smoke. They wore suits of black scale armor, had
blood-red eyes, and sharp claws. All of them stared intently at Ning
and the stone titan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sinfiends.” The
stone titan hurriedly sent mentally to Ning, “Master, this is a
powerful sin treasure which World God Cavecry personally forged. It
is known as the Eversnow Banner and it holds a total of nine
sinfiends, each of which is slightly weaker than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed
upon hearing this. A powerful sin treasure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could instantly tell
that these three ‘sinfiends’ were creatures akin to the ‘ghost
generals’ that existed within the Three Realms. The difference was
that these sinfiends could grow powerful by devouring sin. When given
certain valuable treasures that existed in the primordial chaos, they
could undergo a fundamental transformation and become living
creatures. These nine sinfiends were all World-level creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God Cavecry
died long ago,” the stone titan growled. “The nine of you still
intend to bar me and my master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master? You
acknowledged a puny Elder God as your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master created us.
He shall always be our master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any who barge into
Master’s cultivation grounds shall die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine sinfiends
bellowed and transformed into blurs that charged towards Ning from
every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were intelligent
creatures. They knew that Ning was the master of the stone titan. So
long as they could kill Ning, everything would come to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Foolish sinfiends.”
The stone titan let out a roar, charging forward to meet them. He
transformed into a streak of light, moving far faster than the
sinfiends. His hands became enormous in size as he smashed down
towards the sinfiends with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His enormous palm
smashed down upon them again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan
possessed an overwhelming advantage in strength. As a stone titan
golem, his speed and strength was far superior to the vast majority
of World Gods! However, those World Gods all had high levels of
insight into the Dao and were very skilled, which was why it would be
very hard for the stone titan to slay them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These sinfiends,
however, also didn’t have any insights into the Dao. They solely
relied on their innate gifts and brute strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! A sinfiend let
out an ear-piercing screech as it was smashed aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The private room wasn’t
that large. The stone titan was able to stop six of the sinfiends all
by himself. However, the other three managed to move past the stone
titan and charge straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way we
can kill the stone golem. Kill the Elder God instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eat him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eat him alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the three sinfiends
flew towards Ning, they emitted strange, ear-piercing cries that
caused inaudible ripples of sound that struck out towards Ning’s
soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s soul
was protected by the heartforce soul-lock technique and reinforced by
the azureflower mist energy. It was able to completely negate this
soul attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out with
the sword in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed in
a dazzling manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Killsword stance,
an attack that held nothing back. Ning had just unleashed a tiny
amount of the power of Violetjewel’s quintessence core. Given that
Ning himself had the strength of a World God, how could these puny
sinfiends possibly withstand Ning’s Eternal weapon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel managed to
chop through a sinfiend’s body with some difficulty, splitting it
in two. Alas, the sinfiend completely transformed into mist before
once more reforming in front of Ning. And yet, a look of terror and
disbelief was now in its eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could an Elder
God have injured me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a mere
Elder God be this strong?” All the sinfiends were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surround him and
attack him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just one
person. Surround him, attack him, and kill him!” One sinfiend let
out a sharp cry, followed by shrill screeches from the rest of the
nine. The stone titan bellowed, “Foolish sinfiends! Shatter!” The
stone titan smashed out with its giant palms with abandon. He rarely
had the chance to unleash its full strength in such a manner because
when fighting against World-level experts, they would make it
extremely difficult for him to strike with full force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan struck
out with wild abandon. The sinfiends all tried to avoid him, instead
focusing on attacking Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent out nine
sword-chops in succession, each chop splitting a sinfiend apart.
Alas, Ning was still kept outside the room by their assaults, unable
to enter it. These sinfiends were completely undamaged by his
attacks, and they charged forward in an unceasing stream that
prevented Ning from advancing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are formless
creatures. Chopping them apart is useless.” Ning’s gaze turned
towards the banner that was placed behind the black-robed figure. “If
I can bind that banner, the nine sinfiends will no longer pose any
danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky,” Ning sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The stone
titan looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring that banner to
me,” Ning instructed. Every single sinfiend was roughly as strong
as he was, and they came in an unending stream; it would be extremely
difficult for Ning to move past them and reach the banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
stone titan immediately marched towards the banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop it!” The nine
sinfiends began to panic. They had all been working on avoiding the
stone titan, but now they no longer were able to continue to do so.
The sinfiends all turned to charge towards the stone titans,
resulting in a series of head-on clashes between a pair of giant
stone palms and many sharp claws. Each time, the sinfiends were
blasted apart…and yet, they would almost instantly recover and
continue their attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single sinfiend
was roughly as strong as Ning himself. Eight of them had to work
together in order to stop the stone titan in its tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
suddenly charged towards the banner. Although the lone remaining
sinfiend sought to block him, he was completely dominated by Ning and
his sword-arts. There was no way it could stop Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing the
nine sinfiends could do. If they tied down the stone golem, they
would be unable to tie down Ning. If they tied down Ning, they
wouldn’t be able to tie down the stone golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the banner…the
nine of them weren’t able to touch it. If they did, they would
immediately be sucked into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Smiling, Ning
stretched his hand out and grabbed the banner, immediately pouring
his Immortal energy into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Graaaaah!” The
nine mighty sinfiends didn’t wish to give up, but they all
dispersed into mist and were drawn back into the banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t that hard
or that expensive to create sin treasures, but they are quite
powerful. No wonder so many cultivators end up deciding to walk the
path of evil.” Ning sighed to himself. If one wished to create a
golem, one had to have incredibly profound insights into the art of
formations and large amounts of precious resources. Only then could a
powerful golem to be created. By comparison, golems were far more
costly and difficult to make.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sinfiends? Sinfiends
were easy, and the treasures meant to house them were cheap to make.
After absorbing enough sin, they would naturally become very
powerful, much like how sin-weapons could grow in strength as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Sinfiends
themselves? If they were fed enough sin, they would grow more
powerful as well. The only thing you needed to do was slaughter many
people and collect enough sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting away the
banner, Ning turned his gaze to the black-robed corpse and the
distant painting of sword-ki that was hanging on the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
waved his hand, collecting both the corpse and the painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rocky, let’s look
around and see if we can find any other treasures,” Ning
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two began to
search every nook and cranny of the entire estate for treasures. They
even dug three feet deep into the floor of every room. Only after
completely sweeping through it did they leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a mountain on the
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in a
relaxed manner, then laughed softly. “I’ve swept this island
clean of all treasures. I really made a killing this time. If it
hadn’t been for big brother Solesky, I don’t know how long it
would’ve taken for me to acquire such a hoard of treasures.” Ning
then turned his attention to the treasures which World God Cavecry
had left behind.

Chapter 7 - A Sudden Change
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After searching through
the items, Ji Ning felt both delighted and slightly disappointment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surprise and
delight came from the fact that World God Cavecry truly was quite
wealthy. As a personal disciple of Daolord Windsource, he had
treasures that were worth over a thousand cubes of chaos nectar, not
including the sword-ki painting! What caused Ning to feel slightly
disappointed was the fact that aside from the Eversnow Banner, none
of the treasures of World God Cavecry were of use to himself at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, World God
Cavecry’s most valuable treasure-set was a set of six top-grade Dao
scimitars. They were worth more than five hundred cubes…but alas,
Ning used swords, not scimitars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his armor, it
was a set of high-grade Dao armor. This was the same type of armor
that Immortal Bloodpool had used. Since Ning already had one, this
second set was temporarily of no use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose I’ll
sell it all once I leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cast the treasures
to the back of his mind, then waved his hand to summon the painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
valuable treasure of the entire island. It was definitely worth as
much as an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What secrets are
hidden within this painting?” Ning unfurled the painting and gave
it a close look. He had already bound the painting and so the sword
energy of the painting had been restrained. It now looked completely
ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t have
any divine runes on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There don’t appear
to be any ways to activate it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It…it is just a
painting…” Ning stared at the sword-ki painting, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-ki painting
looked like an ordinary painting of mountains and rivers. It held
mountains, waterfalls, and creeks. In fact, from an artistic
standpoint the painting actually looked rather mediocre. Ning himself
could paint something like this. And yet, whenever Ning extended his
senses into this seemingly ordinary painting, he could sense a
sword-intent that struck fear into his heart. The exalted
sword-intent which filled the painting was just as strong as
Violetjewel’s quintessence core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person who
painted this painting had to be a terrifyingly powerful expert of the
Dao of the Sword,” Ning mused. “But so what? At least I can link
my consciousness up with my sword’s quintessence core and get a
basic understanding of it. All I can do with this painting is look at
it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What use was a painting
that was merely filled with sword-intent that couldn’t be
interacted with?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel’s
quintessence core had a similarly profound sword-intent, but Ning
could actually make use of it to do battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t this
supposed to be equal to an Eternal weapon in value?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh, it makes sense.
Daolord Windsource told World God Cavecry to comprehend and master
this painting, but he wasn’t able to succeed in doing so before he
died. I’m probably at too low a level of insight into the Dao to
understand the true secrets hidden within the painting.” Ning could
do nothing save console himself with these words. Still, he couldn’t
help but give the painting a few more glances. He had a strange
feeling that this painting was hiding certain secrets within it…but
alas, a gauze had been draped over these secrets, making it
impossible for him to behold them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ended up spending
six more hours on the painting before giving up and putting it away
for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
nearby stone titan said curiously, “Why have you come to this
place? I heard that only Samsara Daolords are capable of passing
through the Hundred Streams of the Windsource Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I accompanied my big
brother, of course.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your big brother,
Master?” The stone titan was quite curious, and his dark yellow
eyes suddenly lit up. “Master, your ‘big brother’ is a Daolord?
Where is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He went to the
central island.” Ning pointed to the central island. “We’ll
just wait for him here. When he returns, he’ll take us out of the
Windsource Ruins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Daolord Solesky
didn’t return, Ning himself certainly wouldn’t be strong enough
to lead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that’s where
Daolord Windsource once lived. It is the most dangerous place in this
world,” the stone titan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a golden
ripple of power burst out from the central island. The terrifying
ripple instantly swept out in every direction, terrifying Ning and
causing his face to turn ashen. Upon seeing the golden
omnidirectional wave blast out towards him, he knew that if it
touched him he was dead. He wouldn’t even have a chance to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, as the
golden wave blasted out from the central island it parted past the
various smaller islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?”
Ning was badly rattled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must’ve
activated some formation or trap,” the stone titan offered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that! But he
didn’t activate anything earlier. What happened?” Ning was rather
worried out. He had spent six hours meditating on the sword-ki
painting and nothing had happened…but now, all of a sudden, a huge
shockwave had just blasted out in every direction. This caused Ning
to feel extremely uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the central
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A barefoot, raggedy old
man let out a long breath. The buildings around him had been
completely reduced to rubble. Only a towering palace located at the
very center of this island remained standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn this
Windsource. If he died, he died. Why the hell did he have to leave so
many restrictive formations behind?” Daolord Solesky cursed softly.
“What, did you want everyone to know how badass you once were?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that it
wouldn’t be easy, but upon actually entering the island he
immediately found himself beset with countless dangers, even though
there weren’t any treasures nearby! This caused Daolord Solesky to
feel quite irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nobody can stop my
dao!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not only are you
dead, even when you were alive you wouldn’t have been able to stop
me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky no
longer looked as relaxed as he normally did. A terrifying light was
now shining in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
actually split into two…then into four…then into eight…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
he split into more than ten thousand figures. Every single Daolord
Solesky peered towards the undamaged main palace, then began to walk
towards it from different parts of the island. The countless divine
runes surrounding and protecting the main palace all began to flicker
and flow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Boom. As the thousands of Daolords advanced, some attacks began
to erupt forth and cause his bodies to burst open like bubbles.
However, those bodies would then quickly reform. A disturbance was
caused within the formation, and quite a few of the bodies seized
this opportunity to march inside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, in a seemingly
simple fashion, the thousands of Daolords managed to completely
bypass the protective barrier of countless divine runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the actual
Hundred Streams of the Windsource formation was activated, I might be
in for a bit of trouble. These lesser formations, however, are no
match for me at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Like an illusion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Like a shadow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Space and time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only I remain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousands of bodies
all vanished, leaving behind just one figure standing before the main
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky stood
there, staring at the silver-haired figure seated in the lotus
position within the main palace. The silver-haired man had a handsome
face, was dressed in white robes, had a smile on his face, and
emanated an aura of light. He said with a smile, “I don’t know
which fellow Daoist has arrived. Given how hard you worked to defeat
the thirteen formations surrounding my island, I imagine you must’ve
come for my Talisman of Eternity. The Talisman of Eternity is right
here. Before my Daomerge, I nearly perished in order to acquire this
Talisman of Eternity. So long as you are willing to kowtow to me
three times, fellow Daoist, you may take this talisman with you. But
if you wish to take it by force…hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want me to
kowtow?” Daolord Solesky’s eyes bulged out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are already
dead, and yet you still wish to toy with me? I’ll never kowtow to
you, even if it means that I’ll fail my Daomerge as well!”
Daolord Solesky was truly enraged now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could tell that this
was an illusory image when Daolord Windsource had left behind prior
to dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hundred Streams
of the Windsource Formation is an enormous formation. There’s no
way its full power can be instantly unleashed. Let’s see what other
tricks you have up your sleeve besides this formation!” Daolord
Solesky smiled coldly. “I wasn’t afraid of you when you were
alive. Now that you are dead, I’m even less afraid of you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Daolord
Solesky reached out with his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous illusion of
a giant palm suddenly appeared, and it made a snatching motion
towards the clothes and treasures located at the very center of the
palace. Daolord Windsource had failed his Daomerge, eventually
perishing as a result. Since he had died due to failing his Daomerge,
at the moment of his death his entire body crumbled apart. Even his
truesoul vanished, leaving nothing behind aside from his clothes and
his treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The giant palm
grabbed the clothes and magic treasures. Although there were Eternal
items in the pile, Daolord Solesky didn’t care about them. The only
thing that mattered was the Talisman of Eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I nearly died to
acquire this Talisman of Eternity. Fellow Daoist, you want to simply
seize it from me? Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a cold laugh
began to ring out throughout the main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless divine runes
suddenly began to manifest from every inch of the palace, causing it
to radiate with dazzling light. The entire main palace almost
instantly blew apart, the terrifying shockwave sweeping through the
entire area. Daolord Solesky’s face immediately changed. He didn’t
even have a chance to curse; all he could do was immediately flee for
his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire central
island began to crumble as the savage wave of might spread out in
every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the stone
titan were waiting patiently on their island for Daolord Solesky to
return. They suddenly saw the entire central island begin to break
apart as an incomprehensibly powerful shockwave suddenly lashed out
in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Master!”
The stone titan’s body instantly expanded dramatically as he
transformed into a giant globe that completely surrounded Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island which Ning
was on began to violently tremble…and then, with a boom, it
completely broke apart as well. The shattered bits of the island
began to sink into the surrounding waters of the lake, and the palace
itself was knocked thousands of kilometers away in the blink of an
eye and sent into the distant, howling gray wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone titan was
protecting Ning in the form of a giant boulder that had surrounded
him. It was also sent flying and was swept into the howling gray
wind, quickly disappearing within it.

Chapter 8 - Emperor Mirrorsnow
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A stone titan was deep
inside a giant pit, holding onto the edges of a giant crevice. The
gray wind had dragged it inside here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, the wind is
much weaker here,” the stone titan sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ji Ning let
out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That had been far too
dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, he had
taken on the stone golem as his servant. Otherwise, he probably
would’ve lost his life just now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how my big
brother is doing,” Ning mused to himself. “That blast of power
was simply incredible. Even though the stone titan covered me and
absorbed more than 90% of the force, I still suffered serious
internal injuries and used up a great deal of divine power. Without
it, I definitely would have died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Windsource’s
protective spell was meant to kill other Samsara Daolords who were as
powerful as he had been. It was ridiculously powerful! Just the
collateral shockwave alone was enough to wipe out weaker Samsara
Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly had been
incredibly lucky!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve islands
themselves possessed strong defensive properties. The shockwave had
first expended much of its power tearing apart the islands, then
landed against the stone titan which had protected Ning, who was
wearing a set of high grade Dao armor. All of these factors combined
were why Ning managed to survive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what should
we do next?” The stone titan sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.” Ning sent
mentally, “Let’s just wait here for my big brother to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should be inside
the Hundred Streams of the Windsource Formation,” the stone titan
sent mentally. “I heard that there are many windbeasts located
inside this formation, each of which has the power of a World-level
expert. Once a large number of them surround us, we will be in grave
danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded. He had fought against the windbeasts before. “Don’t
worry. If we just wait here quietly, it’ll be difficult for them to
discover us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” the stone
titan replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed by slowly,
one minute at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the golem
continued to wait within the deep abyss. “I have the talisman of
welcome with me. Big brother can sense exactly where I am located.
Why hasn’t he come to me yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that he…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thought came to
Ning’s mind. Had Daolord Solesky died?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t wish to
believe it. Daolord Solesky had been incredibly powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he couldn’t
help but logically follow this train of thought. That last blast of
power had been incredibly strong. Even the weaker shockwaves
generated by it had been so strong as to wipe out all the islands.
One could imagine how powerful the blast had been within the central
island itself! It was entirely possible that Daolord Solesky had died
in the face of such great power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t die that
easily.” Ning didn’t wish to believe it, and so he continued to
wait quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grew more and more
nervous, but he continued to wait silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly didn’t
wish to believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a rumbling
sound could be heard from deep below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Rocky.”
Ning looked downwards. “It might be a windbeast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A windbeast?” The
stone titan was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a headache
coming. He wasn’t afraid of one windbeast, but if an entire group
of them attacked…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is a
windbeast!” Ning growled. Below them, at the very bottom of the
deep abyss, he could vaguely make out the silvery-blue forms of three
windbeasts. Ning instantly went on full alert…but then, he was
confused. These three windbeasts were actually rolling forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They…roll?” Ning
was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A familiar figure
suddenly appeared next to two of the rolling windbeasts, foot
upraised to deliver a kick. A look of utter terror could be seen on
the windbeasts’ faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, brother Ji
Ning! I finally found you. I searched forever.” The figure was
initially quite blurry, but it quickly appeared before Ning. It was
the ragged, barefoot Daolord Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother!” Ning
was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m glad you are
safe.” Daolord Solesky let out a sigh of relief. “The Hundred
Streams of the Windsource Formation is filled with twists and turns.
It really is a pain in the ass. I could sense you weren’t too far
away, but I just couldn’t find the right path to you. I ended up
moving farther and farther away from you! I had to spend a bit of
time understanding this formation before I could find the correct
tunnel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the twisting
tunnels really pissed me off. I really wanted to wreck the entire
damn thing, but in the end I managed to keep my temper down.”
Daolord Solesky’s face was rather ashen. He waved his hand towards
the nearby wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A giant illusory hand
tore the wall open, carving out a small cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suffered a bit of
an injury. I need to take a rest. We’ll leave later,” Daolord
Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. I’m in
no rush,” Ning said. Ning understood that Daolord Solesky had
probably rushed off to search for him without even taking the time to
heal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Windsource guy really is a dumbass. Even in death, he wanted to screw
other people over.” Daolord Solesky entered the cave, then sat down
in a rather frustrated, embarrassed manner. “Thank goodness this
old man is pretty strong. Otherwise, this old man would’ve died
just now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and heal,”
Ning urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daolord
Solesky nodded and closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.
A series of illusory circles began to radiate out from Daolord
Solesky, causing spacetime to twist and distort. The flow of time in
the surrounding area began to speed up rapidly, making time in the
area move roughly a hundred times faster than in the outside world.
Streams of condensed chaos energy began to swirl around Daolord
Solesky, transforming him into a black hole that devoured chaos
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s absorbing
energy from the primordial chaos even faster than I absorb energy
from chaos jewels.” Ning was secretly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly an entire year
went by before the process came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The streams of chaos
energy vanished and spacetime in the cave went back to normal.
Daolord Solesky opened his eyes. Nearly a year had gone by within the
cave, while merely three days had gone by in the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine now.”
Daolord Solesky rose to his feet, a smug look on his face. “That
Windsource idiot had to have spent a lot of time and effort setting
up that nasty formation. A pity for him that this old man completely
recovered after spending just three days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations, big
brother,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! Yes, I should
indeed be congratulated. This journey of mine into the Windsource
Ruins was a success.” Daolord Solesky looked at Ning. “How about
you? Did you get that painting?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I acquired the
sword-ki painting.” Ning nodded. “However, I can’t see anything
special about it at all, aside from its aura of sword-ki.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! You don’t
get it. Hand it over to me, I’ll help you take a look at it,”
Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the painting to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
accepted the painting, opening it and taking a look at it. He nodded
slightly as he pointed at the mountains and rivers. “Artistically
speaking, this painting really is hideous. Emperor Mirrorsnow clearly
is terrible at painting, yet he still takes delight in it. If he
spent just a bit of effort on the actual Dao of Painting, he would’ve
immediately reached an incredibly high level of skill in painting and
calligraphy. And yet, he refuses to actually train in it, instead
insisting on treating it as his hobby.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning said, “That’s
how hobbies work, I suppose. If he treated it as part of his
cultivation, he would’ve no longer enjoyed it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose.”
Daolord Solesky nodded. “Your words make sense. Anyhow, although
this painting is quite unsightly, it definitely is as valuable as an
Eternal weapon. Emperor Mirrorsnow succeeded in his Daomerge, after
all. He became an ancient, eternal figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A successful
Daomerge means becoming eternal?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Eternal.”
Daolord Solesky mused softly, a distant look in his eyes, “Truly
eternal in every possible spacetime continuum. No matter how much
time passes, they shall remain eternal and everlasting. This old man
is just one step away from that level…but alas, this step is the
hardest step of all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough of that.”
Daolord Solesky looked at Ning. “In short…I once had the
opportunity to meet Emperor Mirrorsnow. However, roughly a thousand
chaos cycles ago, Emperor Mirrorsnow departed and ventured off into
unknown realms. The endless primordial chaos is simply too vast. As
someone who had become a truly eternal figure, Emperor Mirrorsnow
naturally would want to continue his journeys and see more things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was a fickle,
restless man. He didn’t have the patience necessary to teach any
disciples. However, before he left, he produced a total of forty
sword-ki paintings,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forty?” Ning was
surprised. That many?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daolord
Solesky nodded. “A total of ten sets of four paintings.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can collect
an entire set and pass the trials he established within the
paintings, you’ll be able to receive his legacy and become his
personal disciple,” Daolord Solesky said. “Every single set can
only be successfully used once, and so theoretically speaking he can
take on a total of ten disciples at most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course,
Emperor Mirrorsnow scattered those forty paintings across many
territories.” Daolord Solesky laughed. “To collect an entire set
of four will be quite hard. This painting that you have is the third
painting in the set.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said,
“But I didn’t discover any trials yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…every single
Mirrorsnow Painting actually holds an estate-world within it,”
Daolord Solesky said. “Once you go inside it, you’ll be given a
trial. If you master the relevant sword-art, you’ll have succeeded
in passing the trial.”

Chapter 9 - The Badlands Court
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An estate-world?”
Ning was rather startled. He had already bound the painting to
himself, but he had yet to discover any estate-world hidden inside of
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky began
to laugh when he saw the look Ning’s face. “That’s why I said
you don’t get it. Emperor Mirrorsnow left behind those ten sets of
paintings with the intention of finding good disciples for himself.
However, as an Emperor who had succeeded in his Daomerge and gained
eternity, he naturally hoped for his disciples to be figures of great
power. They had to at least be capable of becoming Samsara Daolords!
How could he possibly be willing to take on an Elder God or Ancestral
Immortal as his disciple? They are far too weak, and some have been
alive for countless chaos cycles and will never become World-level
experts. If someone this weak became his disciple, he would’ve
wasted a legacy spot!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, only
World-level experts can sense the true mysteries hidden within the
Mirrorsnow Paintings. Only they are worthy of being tested by it,”
Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be at
least a World-level expert?” Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, you have to BE a
World-level expert!” Daolord Solesky explained, “If you were a
Samsara Daolord, you still wouldn’t be able to enter. Samsara
Daolords are too strong; they would be able to easily pass his trial.
However, Samsara Daolords have already found their own paths and
discovered their own Daos. His legacy would be completely useless to
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has to be
World-level experts. Only World-level experts can use these
paintings! Only World-level experts are worthy of becoming his
disciples,” Daolord Solesky said. “Emperor Mirrorsnow’s Dao was
the Dao of the Sword! You are quite a good fit, which is why I agreed
to let you go to that island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder Daolord
Windsource had his disciple, World God Cavecry, spend his time
meditating on the Mirrorsnow Painting. It could be said that he was
actually treating his disciple quite decently by giving him this
opportunity. Alas, this was a trial that had been set down by an
Eternal Emperor who had succeeded in his Daomerge. One had to acquire
and master all four paintings in order to become his disciple, while
World God Cavecry hadn’t been able to pass the trial of even a
single painting. If he had succeeded, Daolord Windsource would’ve
viewed him in a different light and allowed him to live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only have a single
painting, and there’s only ten sets in total. Emperor Mirrorsnow
scattered them throughout the territories…” Ning said worriedly,
“Big brother, how am I supposed to get a full set?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten sets, forty
paintings.” Daolord Solesky smiled merrily. “There are ten of
each painting, so it’s not impossible for you to collect an entire
set.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened
carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really shouldn’t
get involved. I should let you temper yourself and adventure for the
paintings, but…my rashness damn near got you killed just now.”
Daolord Solesky said, “So I suppose it would only be fair for me to
give you something nice in compensation. It doesn’t make much of a
difference anyhow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Catch.” Daolord
Solesky pulled out a jade slip and tossed it to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the slip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Memorize this,”
Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately sent his Immortal energy into the jade slip as he began
to read it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A stream of information
began to enter his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
discovered a lifeblood oath within the jade slip. One had to swear a
lifeblood oath in order to gain access to its contents. Ning read
through the lifeblood oath. Simply put, it was an oath to never
reveal the contents of the jade slip under any circumstances. If he
discovered similar information from other sources, he could only
reveal the part he had learned from other sources to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This oath wasn’t too
stringent. Ning swore the lifeblood oath, then accepted the large
amount of information that surged towards his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Mirrorsnow
has a total of ten sets of paintings. We’ve discovered six
ownerless sets of the first painting. The first is located in the
third-level world of the ‘Lost Tower City’ of the Voidblue
Territory…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve discovered
five ownerless sets of the second painting. The first is located in
the Snowfall Territory…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve discovered
seven ownerless sets of the third painting. The first is located…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve discovered
three ownerless sets of the fourth painting…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared
speechlessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only forty
paintings total, but there were records of twenty-one paintings here!
They were scattered throughout the various territories, with the
Badlands Territory holding merely two paintings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was the third
painting, located in the core regions of the Windsource Ruins.
Daolord Windsource had acquired it long ago. The core region was an
incredibly dangerous place where Daolord Windsource had died. It was
filled with many treasures but countless dangers. World-level experts
who attempted to enter it would almost invariably perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was the
first painting. It was located in the Allgod Estate. Daolord Allgod
had acquired it long ago. Although it was merely in the inner region
of the state, which wasn’t that dangerous, the Allgod Estate was a
place which was easily entered but almost impossible to leave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This jade slip even
contained detailed information regarding the various dangers one
would encounter within the Windsource Ruins and the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big…” Ning was
truly shocked. Why did his big brother have such a detailed
intelligence report regarding such an important treasure that was
scattered across so many territories? In Ning’s eyes, this sort of
valuable information was equal to an Eternal weapon in value! Without
this intelligence, he wouldn’t have even known where to begin
searching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember,” Daolord
Solesky said solemnly. “You are not allowed to discuss it with any
others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, when
you are strong enough, you can go and search based on the
intelligence I just gave you,” Daolord Solesky said. ‘However,
these places are all rather dangerous. The ones in easy-to-get
locations have been picked up long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the Allgod
Estate…if you choose to challenge it, you must be careful,”
Daolord Solesky said. “When Daolord Allgod was alive, he was an
extremely dangerous Daolord. Even I wouldn’t have been a match for
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Daolord Allgod was this incredible?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod Estate…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had heard of this
place before. It was another one of the ancient ruins located within
the Badlands Territory, and it was said to be even more dangerous
than the Windsource Ruins. Roughly 30% of the Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals who entered that place would make it out alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was terrifyingly
strong, far more so than Daolord Windsource. Even amongst Daolords,
the Allgod Estate is not a place where many would dare tread!”
Daolord Solesky let out a sigh. “Let’s go. I already have the
talisman I need. Accompany me to the Badlands Court. We’re going to
meet Daolord Badlands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, we’re
going to go meet Daolord Badlands?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said, I came to
the Badlands Territory because there are two places I have to visit,”
Daolord Solesky said. “The first place was the Windsource Ruins. As
for the second place…I’ll need Daolord Badlands to help me out
with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands…he
was indisputably the number one cultivator of the entire Badlands
Territory. His power was unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky led
Ning out of the Windsource Ruins. They travelled to Sevenwater Star,
then spent a hundred bottles of chaos nectar to travel to the
Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wind was blowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky led
Ning forward atop a cloud through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flying…” Ning
still hadn’t recovered from his shock. “Big brother, you are able
to fly in the Badlands Everworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This everworld does
indeed have certain restrictions placed upon it.” Daolord Solesky
smiled. “Its laws were created by the ancient power which created
this everworld…but since a person was able to create these laws,
then another person would be capable of resisting these laws! This
old man is just one step away from the Daomerge. If that ancient
power came in person, he’d be able to suppress me, but he’s been
gone for countless years. These empty laws cannot bind me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This old man can
fly, but weaker Daolords wouldn’t be able to.” Daolord Solesky
had quite a smug look on his face. “Ah, there we are.” He pointed
towards the front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ahead of them was an
enormous lake that was at least a million kilometers in size.
Ordinary mortals would describe it as a sea, but to cultivators it
truly was nothing more than an inland lake. A large estate could be
seen hovering above the lake, filled with countless buildings. In
front of the great estate was an enormous stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stele was three
thousand meters high, and there was a single word engraved upon it -
Badlands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vigorous, heroic aura
spread out from that stele, shaking the world around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands Court,”
Ning murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The legendary Badlands
Court! In truth, a smaller ‘Badlands Court’ existed within
Waveshift City as well. However, this place was the true center and
foundation of the organization. This was where Daolord Badlands
lived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands!” Daolord
Solesky led Ning downwards, sending their cloud soaring across the
lake. His voice echoed throughout the region. “This old man has
come here to eat your food and drink your wine!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few figures in
the Badlands Court raised their heads to look up. When they saw the
ragged, barefoot old man flying through the skies with a white-robed
youth in tow, all of them were quite speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s flying?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can fly in an
everworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were proud,
arrogant figures. They were World Gods and Chaos Immortals who could
all but do as they pleased in the Badlands Territory…and yet, all
of their hearts trembled. They knew very well what it meant for
someone to be able to fly in this everworld. They all quickly put on
very friendly looks as they gazed at the figures in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! How wonderful
that you’ve arrived, big brother Solesky! It wouldn’t matter even
if you ate me out of house and home!” A booming laugh rang out as
an azure-robed man and a beautiful lady walked out of a house
together. They walked into the air, striding towards Daolord Solesky.
</P>

Chapter 10 - An Avatar
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the cultivators of
the Badlands Court saw these two emerge, they all felt quite proud.
See? Daolord Badlands of our Badlands Court is also capable of flying
in this everworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Badlands
really lives up to his reputation.” Ji Ning stood next to Daolord
Solesky, simply watching this all happen. He was secretly quite
surprised Solesky himself had said that weaker Daolords wouldn’t be
able to fly in this everworld. Daolord Solesky truly was a formidable
figure who was capable of controlling an entire territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Daolord
Solesky glanced at the beautiful lady in surprise. “Little sister
Yan’er, you reached the Daolord level as well? Congratulations,
Badlands! You don’t even know how many of our old friends envy you
two Dao-companions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just broke through
recently.” The beautiful lady smiled. “And I’m merely at the
first step. I’ll be happy if I can one day have even a fraction of
your power, big brother Solesky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yan’er loves to
waste time on random things. I’m amazed she even managed to become
a Daolord.” The azure-robed man smiled as he looked towards Ning.
“This is a member of your Vastheaven Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, he’s a
brother of Vastheaven Palace.” Daolord Solesky nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning greets you,
Daolords.” Ning immediately greeted the two respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the
Badlands Territory knew that the Badlands Court was run by Daolord
Badlands. Who would’ve thought that his Dao-companion would also
become a Daolord?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao-companion…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How wonderful it would
be if he could journey through the vast universe alongside Yu Wei?
Solesky’s words were correct; countless cultivators felt envious of
Daolord Badlands and his Dao-companion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A brother of
Vastheaven Palace?” Daolord Badlands gave Ning a second look, as
did the beautiful woman next to him. Both felt that this Ji Ning
fellow truly was quite lucky. It must be understood that for anyone
wandering the primordial chaos, a powerful backer was of paramount
importance. Generally speaking, anyone who heard the words ‘a
brother of Vastheaven Palace’ would be terrified and unwilling to
launch an attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All members of
Vastheaven Palace viewed each other as brothers. They were a truly
united force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, only a truly
crazed, insane individual would dare to attack a member of Vastheaven
Palace. The only reason the three Wujiao Godbeasts had dared to do so
was because their greed had truly overwhelmed them…and it was also
because they knew that World God Northrest didn’t have any clones!
If he had left a clone at Vastheaven Palace, the three Wujiao
Godbeasts would have never dared to attack him under any situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be a brother of
Vastheaven Palace meant far more than merely being a disciple of the
Badlands Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of the
Badlands Court could do whatever they pleased in the Badlands
Territory! Not even God Emperor Blacklotus or the Starlord of
Fogstone would have dared to do anything to one of them. However, in
the other territories of the Endless Territories, the Badlands Court
was a much less imposing presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
disciples of the Badlands Court were clearly delineated in status
based on their strength. The life of an Elder God or Ancestral
Immortal was naturally valued much less than that of a World-level
experts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Vastheaven
Palace treated all of its members equally. The life of every single
member was incredibly precious, and actually joining Vastheaven
Palace was extremely difficult. Once one succeeded in joining it, one
would instantly be protected by its mighty aura and reputation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
Badlands Court was overall weaker than Vastheaven Palace. Daolord
Solesky of Vastheaven Palace was a Daolord who was on the Verge of
the Daomerge, while Daolord Warlord was quite close to him in
strength. Now that it had given birth to a third Daolord, it had only
become still more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the only
formidable figure the Badlands Court possessed was Daolord Badlands
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eating and drinking
isn’t the main reason I came this time. There’s something I need
to trouble you with, Badlands.” Daolord Solesky turned slightly
more serious as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Come, come.
Let’s sit and talk it over,” Daolord Badlands said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky led
Ning while Daolord Badlands led his wife. The four flew into a
secluded residence within the Badlands Court. The entire Badlands
Court was merely a hundred thousand kilometers or so in size, but it
was filled with quite a few mountains where the disciples of the
Badlands Court had set up homes. Daolord Badlands had chosen a
location which was the most quiet, secluded location within the
entire region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside this thatched
cottage, there was a long wooden table. Daolord Badlands and his wife
sat down on one end of the table, while Daolord Solesky led Ning to
sit down on the other end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
personally poured two cups of fragrant wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
what do you need my aid with? So long as I can help you, I will
definitely do my best,” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Warlord is now in
control of Vastheaven Palace, while brother Overflow has also broken
through to become a Samsara Daolord. I no longer have anything to
worry about, and so I can now focus on my Daomerge.” Daolord
Solesky said slowly, “But…I’m still not completely confident in
being able to succeed in it. The main reason I came to the Badlands
Territory is because of the Waveshift world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was listening to
this discussion carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
dangerous and mysterious place of the entire Badlands Territory! The
Badlands Territory had quite a few dangerous regions within it. Some
were naturally formed from the primordial chaos itself while others
were ruins left behind by deceased Samsara Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift world,
however, was the personal estate of the ancient power who had
established the Badlands Everworld itself. It was filled with both
incredible dangers as well as countless treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals who entered it were absolutely guaranteed to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The majority of
World-level experts who entered it would perish as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You acquired the
talisman?” Daolord Badlands asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I paid a visit to
the Windsource Ruins and acquired a talisman, yes.” Daolord Solesky
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Daolord
Badlands was surprised. “I entered that place as well, but when I
performed a bit of divination, I predicted that I could very well
perish if I tried to force my way through it. I ended up leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha! You live up
to your reputation, Badlands! In terms of Numerancy divinations, you
rank amongst the top three Daolords! Even my brother Warlord is a bit
inferior to you.” Daolord Solesky sighed. “Your prediction was
quite accurate. Daolord Windsource died, but he still wanted to
ensure that others wouldn’t profit from his death. That final,
cataclysmic attack he unleashed…thankfully, this old man is
extremely skilled in staying alive. Other experts on my level who
specialize in other areas may have very well died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daolord
Badlands nodded. “My own divination told me as well that I would
probably die if I tried to force it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was
extremely famous. The reason why Vastheaven Palace was such a
powerful organization was primarily due to Daolord Solesky’s
personal might, and he was famous for being incredibly hard to kill!
If you weren’t able to kill him, he would eventually come seek
revenge upon you. Thus, most of the other ancient powers were
unwilling to make an enemy out of him. This was also why Daolord
Solesky was confident enough to force his way through the Windsource
Ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you have
the Talisman of Eternity…big brother Solesky, you can go to the
Waveshift world.” Daolord Badlands nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not familiar
with that place. No one is more familiar with that place than you,
Badlands. That’s why I’m hoping you can help me out,” Daolord
Solesky said. “Send one of your avatars and accompany me in my
journey through the Waveshift world. Of course, I’m not asking you
to do all this for free.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Daolord
Solesky took out an estate-treasure and handed it over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands
accepted the treasure, pondered for a moment, then nodded. “Fine.
I’ll send my avatar to accompany you to the Waveshift world, big
brother Solesky! But I’ll need a bit of time. Give me three years
to prepare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m in no rush.”
Daolord Solesky relaxed slightly after seeing Daolord Badlands agree.
Avatars were incredibly important to Daolords, and the chances that
Daolord Badlands’ avatar would survive the trip to the Waveshift
world were quite low. That was why Daolord Solesky not only had to
pay a high price, he also had to see if Daolord Badlands was willing
to give him face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the two
were good friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way he
could’ve forced Daolord Badlands to do this. First of all, Daolord
Badlands was extremely powerful, on par with Daolord Solesky himself.
Secondly, if Badlands didn’t whole-heartedly wish to help him and
instead wanted to scheme against him, it wouldn’t be too hard for
Badlands to cause trouble with skewed divination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Water Curtain
Home is located quite close to my place, and nobody is staying inside
it. Big brother Solesky, why don’t you stay there for now along
with my young friend Ji Ning?” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well! Badlands,
no need to send us off. We’ll go by ourselves.” Daolord Solesky
immediately led Ning to depart from this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands and
the beautiful woman remained seated in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord husband.”
The beautiful woman was rather worried. “The Waveshift world is
filled with many dangers…and as you know, the place which Daolord
Solesky is travelling to can be considered part of the core region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Daolord
Badlands nodded. “Although it isn’t easy to create an avatar, if
I spend three years in a spatial treasure I should be able to
recreate a slightly weaker avatar. My true body will remain here as
well, slowly empowering it and strengthening it. Big brother Solesky
gave me enough treasure to create two avatars, with a little to
spare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
beautiful woman nodded, but she remained somewhat unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful avatar was
incredibly important, both to Daolord Badlands himself as well as the
entire Badlands Court.

Chapter 11 - The Daolord’s Arrangements
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Water Curtain Home
of the Badlands Court took up an area of roughly a hundred
kilometers. It was a secluded, graceful place which the Badlands
Court used to receive its most distinguished visitors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Water Curtain Home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a dwelling
with a garden, a palace, a study, and other buildings that were all
hovering atop a great lake of water. They were connected to each
other by a series of levitating wooden bridges, and a barefoot,
ragged old man was currently walking alongside a white-robed youth
across one of those bridges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Daolord
Solesky let out a sigh of relief, an emotional look on his face. “I
knew Badlands would help me out. When he actually said it, though, I
couldn’t help but feel rather guilty. I really hate owing favors to
my old friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just an
avatar, big brother. You aren’t asking him to go in person. Even if
he loses it, he should be able to remake it quite quickly, right?”
Ji Ning was rather puzzled by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky turned
to look at Ning. “A short period of time? Do you know how a Daolord
creates his avatar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
slowly shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When a World-level
expert finds his own Dao and is about to break through to become a
Samsara Daolord, he must first ensure that both his body and his soul
have reached the utter apex of fullness,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The utter apex of
fullness?” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other words, all
of his clones must be merged into one,” Daolord Solesky said. “It
doesn’t matter what type of cloning technique you might’ve
learned in the past; you must merge all of your bodies into one. Of
course, there are some special cases, such as the ‘Primaltwins’
which can be created by mortal cultivators. Because both the
Primaltwin and the true body have undergone the Celestial
Tribulation, there’s no way for them to merge together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself had a
Primaltwin that was a Ki Refiner. His true body was a dual refiner,
training as both a Fiendgod Body Refiner and a Ki Refiner. His true
body had eighteen clones, all of which could join together because
they were completely identical. However, there were significant
differences between Ning’s Primaltwin and his true body. There was
no way to merge them whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, cultivators
who started off as mortals essentially have two lives,” Daolord
Solesky said with a laugh. “However, although more than half of
high-level cultivators started off as ordinary mortals, quite a few
of them don’t have Primaltwins! Some of them died, after all, over
their many years of cultivation. I would say that more than 90% of
Samsara Daolords only have their true body and do not have a
Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at me. I’m a
Samsara Daolord, and I’m currently very far away from Vastheaven
Palace. Why is it that I’m still in touch with them? It is
precisely because I have my ‘avatar’ there.” Daolord Solesky
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Avatars are created
from magic treasures!” Daolord Solesky explained, “They are much
like golems. We forge golem-bodies for ourselves, then send a strand
of our soul into them and take control of them! Simply put, we
essentially need to fully and perfectly merge our soul with a
golem-body, then pour energy into it to upgrade it. The cost of every
single avatar is greater than the cost of buying ten Eternal
weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures which
I gave Badlands are enough for him to make two absolutely top-tier
avatars, with a bit left to spare.” Daolord Solesky let out a sigh.
“But raw materials isn’t the only thing needed to ensure that an
avatar body can reach maximum power. The Daolord himself will need to
spend an extremely long period of time building it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, each
Daolord can generally only work on a single avatar at once. Each
avatar only had a small amount of his soul, after all; once he stops
focusing on it, it will slowly degrade in power. Generally speaking,
most Daolords only have a single avatar,” Daolord Solesky
explained. “I only have a single avatar myself. Because avatars are
essentially bodies formed from magic treasures, my avatar is able to
seamlessly and perfectly integrate into the great formation
protecting Vastheaven Palace. When fused into the formation, the
power of my avatar is comparable to my own power! This ensures that
it is more than capable of keeping Vastheaven Palace safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, when an
avatar serves as the core of a defensive formation, it will ensure
that the power of the formation itself will become tremendous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An avatar is a core
force for any organization’s defenses.” Daolord Solesky looked at
Ning. “Daolord Badlands’ avatar is also capable of perfectly
integrating into the formation protecting the Badlands Court. For me
to ask him to send his avatar with me into the Waveshift world means
that the Badlands Court’s defenses will be significantly weakened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning started to
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why he
needs three years is because he needs the time to create a second,
weaker avatar. In addition, this also means that his true body will
have to stay at the Badlands Court and be unable to leave it!”
Daolord Solesky continued, “Once his powerful avatar dies in the
Waveshift world, he’ll immediately turn all of his efforts and
attention to strengthening the second avatar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already
prepared for his avatar’s death?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daolord
Solesky nodded. “His avatar stands a 90% chance of death if it
joins me on a trip to the Waveshift world. A perfect avatar that he
spend countless years on is going to die, just like that. This isn’t
just something that can be waved away by giving him some treasures. I
owe Badlands now! If I fail in my Daomerge, then before I die I’ll
do everything I can to pay him back. But right now, I must do
everything I can for my Daomerge. Nothing else matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had thought that an
‘avatar’ was something akin to the dharma-bodies which Lord
Tathagata had in the Three Realms, a body that was created through
divine abilities or secret arts. Now, it seemed, they were more like
golems! They were completely different concepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Daolord
Solesky sat down within a wooden house that was located inside the
garden that was hovering above the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything is going
as I predicted. I now have the Talisman of Eternity, and Badlands
will be sending his avatar to accompany me to the Waveshift world.”
Daolord Solesky looked at Ning. “The only thing I didn’t predict
was that you would be here. I won’t be able to take you to
Vastheaven Palace right away. If everything goes completely and
perfectly according to plan on my trip to the Waveshift world, I
should be able to return in four or five years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if I end up
trapped somewhere inside the Waveshift world, things will get tricky.
I might be stuck there for hundreds of million years, or perhaps even
as much as a hundred chaos cycles.” Daolord Solesky looked at Ning.
“If I’m trapped there for an extended period of time, you’ll
have to head off to Vastheaven Palace on your own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
me, big brother.” Ning was quite confident in his abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be hard
for you to break through to become a World God. Once you make your
breakthrough, it’ll be much safer for you to travel off to
Vastheaven Palace on your own.” Daolord Solesky waved his hand,
causing a shimmering golden scroll to appear in the air before him.
“This star map has a detailed route that leads from the Badlands
Territory to the Vastheaven Territory. Memorize it right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was delighted. He
immediately sent a strand of his coresense into the scroll, quickly
memorizing its contents. After finishing, Ning was badly shocked by
what he discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What an incredible
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory
was located extremely far away from the Vastheaven Territory. The
route which Daolord Solesky gave him was the simplest route possible,
but it still required him to travel through a hundred and twenty-one
different territories! Details regarding quite a few danger zones
were also recorded on the star map. It must be understood that even
the Starlord of Fogstone had only visited a few of the neighboring
territories. If one wandered about randomly without a good star map,
one could easily end up into a dangerous part of a foreign,
unfamiliar territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The star map I gave
you only includes roughly three hundred or so territories worth of
information.” Daolord Solesky looked at Ning, then said solemnly,
“There are also quite a few other foreign territories that I didn’t
note down because I’m worried that you might go astray. The Endless
Territories are filled with countless dangers. A World-level expert
can’t just go running around randomly. You have to follow the line
I mapped out. It’ll lower the danger level significantly…but
despite that, you are not to head out until you become a World-level
expert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no such thing
as true safety in the primordial chaos. It was filled with countless
mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The existing maps and
travel lines had been all verified and authenticated by countless
generations of cultivators who had risked their very lives. These
were all safe routes! If you ran around randomly without paying
attention to those routes, you could easily end up trapped in a
dangerous death trap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distance between
the Badlands Territory and the Vastheaven Territory was simply too
great. The route which Daolord Solesky had provided included some
definitely safe locations as well as relatively safe locations. Only
when Ning was strong enough would he be able to reach his
destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll bestow a few
techniques upon you as well.” Daolord Solesky waved his hand,
causing a series of bamboo slips to appear on the table before Ning.
“In truth, after you formally join Vastheaven Palace you’ll be
given access to a large amount of techniques and secret arts.
Still…the formal rites will only occur after you actually reach
Vastheaven Palace. Only then will you become a true member of
Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have the
talisman of welcome, and so it’s not a big deal if I bestow a few
techniques upon you early.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master these
techniques and do your best to become a World-level expert as soon as
possible. If I’m not able to return, you’ll have to rely on your
own power to go to Vastheaven Palace,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, big brother.”
Ning felt tremendously grateful. Daolord Solesky had already taken
many factors into account in trying to help Ning out. It wasn’t
realistic to expect him to abandon his own plans and instead shepherd
Ning through more than a hundred territories, some of which weren’t
even directly linked by transfer arrays. There were actually a number
of dangerous regions on the way as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent the next
three years living in the Badlands Court. He permitted his retainers,
Flamefairy Su Youji and Elder God Wilddog, to come out from his
estate-world and also take up residence in the Water Curtain Home for
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During these three
years, Daolord Solesky would occasionally provide Ning with a bit of
guidance. He even gave some advice to the Flamefairy. As for Elder
God Wilddog, his comprehension abilities were too weak. Daolord
Solesky couldn’t be bothered to teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years passed in
the blink of an eye.

Chapter 12 - The Nature of the Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this day, Ji Ning
was seated within the levitating wooden study, working on his
calligraphy. Every single character was filled with his surging
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him was the
Flamefairy, Su Youji. She was obediently helping him grind his ink
and watching as Ning wrote. Usually, the Flamefairy was a woman with
a temper that was just as fiery as her name. The reason why she was
being so obedient as to help him grind his ink wasn’t just because
she was his retainer; it was also because she wanted to spend as much
time next to him as possible. That way, when Daolord Solesky came to
offer Ning his advice, he might give her some off-hand advice as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Daolord is
simply incredible.” Whenever the Flamefairy thought of Daolord
Solesky, she was filled with admiration and amazement. “He gave me
a few pointers during the past three years, allowing me to get a
clear picture of what I need to do to advance to the World level.
Once I break through this bottleneck, I’ll become a World-level
expert!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had benefited
tremendously through her association with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was a
Samsara Daolord who had reached the very Verge of the Daomerge. There
was no one else like him in the entire Badlands Territory; even
Daolord Badlands was slightly weaker than him! For her to have the
chance to get advice from someone like him was truly a tremendous
blessing for her! When she had to learn on her own and struggle
through many wrong paths, she had still become comparable to a
supreme Elder God even though she was just a Ki Refiner. These days,
she was improving at an astonishing pace and was just a breath away
from becoming a World-level expert herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had made
significant improvements as well. Daolord Solesky had even personally
sparred with him a few times while using the sword. As a result,
Ning’s understanding regarding the nature of the sword was
undergoing a series of fundamental changes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one was at a
completely different level of power, one would have a different
perspective on the Dao. Although World God Blackmist was a formidable
figure, there was a limit to how much he understood. Although Daolord
Solesky didn’t really focus on the Dao of the Sword, there were
certain commonalities which every single Dao shared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I once heard
Emperor Mirrorsnow discuss what the sword is. I felt that his words
made a great deal of sense.” Daolord Solesky had once said these
words to Ning. “The sword is a weapon which living beings created
in order to kill others! The sword has a tip, two edges, and two flat
sides. It was designed to kill. In order for you to discover and
understand the Dao of the Sword, you need to start with its creation
and its design.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should the tip
of the sword be used to kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should you use a
single edge of the sword to kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should you use
both edges together to kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should you use
the flat of the blade to kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When all these
things are mixed together…how should you use them to kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you meditate on
the Dao, you meditate on the prime essence and primal nature of a
thing. You should focus on simplicity, rather than complexity! If
your Dao gets more and more complex, eventually you will lose
yourself within it! Your Dao can appear to be complex to others, but
to you it must be as clear and bright as a mirror.” Daolord Solesky
had looked at Ning. “Remember this. This is very important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also - all
techniques spring from the same source! If you reach a bottleneck
that you cannot overcome in the Dao of the Sword, you can switch to
other tasks such as calligraphy. I saw that your calligraphy isn’t
bad, and you can infuse it with your Dao of the Sword. This is
something that is quite different from using it to fight. However,
these two things will share many commonalities, and both have their
strengths with regards to helping you understand the Dao. Based on
what I know, the majority of Samsara Daolords who focus on the Dao of
the Sword also enjoy painting and calligraphy. I imagine there has to
be a good reason for this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can also see that
you have high affinity towards water, lightning, and space. Don’t
discard or abandon these insights. Focus on them as well. There are
commonalities between every single Dao. For example, although I’ve
never focused on the Dao of the Sword, if I spent four or five days
on it my mastery over the Dao of the Sword would become comparable to
that of some weaker Samsara Daolords who do focus on the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had felt as though
a brand new gateway had just appeared before him, one which had
brought him a completely new way of looking at the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never intended
to give up on water, lightning, space, or any of his other Daos. He
did understand that all Daos shared certain commonalities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for calligraphy, he
had always felt that that writing calligraphy was very pleasing and
relaxing. However, only after listening to Daolord Solesky’s words
did he truly understand how helpful it could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A new world had truly
opened up before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Long, long
ago, one of the first creatures of the primordial chaos created the
very first ‘sword’. Ever since then, countless living beings have
used his ‘sword’. Their techniques constantly improved until it
all reached the level of a Dao unto itself that only became more and
more powerful. Only then did the Dao of the Sword, a Dao feared by
countless cultivators, come into existence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tip of the
sword…the edge…the double edge…the flat…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since that day,
the way in which Ning viewed the sword completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he had
always felt that the Dao of the Sword was truly unfathomably
profound, and he had dedicated himself to piously and slowly
understanding all of its mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, Ning had a
different view of the sword. Although the Dao of the Sword was indeed
profound, its fundamental essence remained quite simple; it lay in
the sword itself. If you could truly understand the structure of a
sword, you would be able to quickly grasp the essence of the Dao of
the Sword itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now viewed the
[Brightmoon] sword-art and the [Nameless] sword-art in completely
different ways. He immediately began to retrofit them, making the
‘Blood Drop’ stance purer, the ‘Soleheart’ stance more
ephemeral, the ‘Yin-Yang’ stance more chaotic, the
‘Heavenbreaker’ stance more dominating, and the ‘Shadowless’
stance slightly less unpredictable but even faster than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, he split the
Heavenbreaker stance into two different stances. The first used the
edge of the sword to attack and was known as the ‘Heavenbreaker
Hacker’; the other used the flat of the blade to attack and was
known as the ‘Heavenbreaker - Eliminator’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
[Brightmoon] sword-art had suddenly increased more than twofold, just
because he now had a completely different way of viewing the sword.
In the distant future, Ning would understand how tremendously
beneficial this new way of thinking would be for him and also feel
even more gratitude towards Daolord Solesky for advising him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Daolord
Solesky was currently seated off in the distant, leisurely sipping
some wine and watching as Ji Ning worked on his calligraphy within
that levitating wooden study. Daolord Solesky couldn’t help but nod
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning really
does have some talent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was not to be
transmitted casually!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t just that
his guidance was incredibly valuable or precious. His avatar in
Vastheaven Palace was capable of giving good guidance to every single
member of Vastheaven Palace…and yet, every single cultivator had
their own firm beliefs. If your guidance was very different from what
they believed or what their own insights were, they would reject your
guidance on an intrinsic level. Or worse; because they trusted in the
Daolord and felt certain that his words had to be right, they might
end up questioning their own Dao and losing their own way. That would
be even worse!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, each person’s
Dao truly was different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t easy for a
master to find a good disciple! When Ning had created his
[Brightmoon] sword-art, he had already drawn the rough sketches of
his own personal understanding of the Dao. When Ning had been in the
Three Realms, he had proudly and foolishly believed that he could
infuse the entirety of the Dao of the Sword into his five stances.
What he didn’t realize was that all five stances were just
variations on the prime essence of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already reached
out to the prime essence of the sword. He just didn’t understand
that he had done so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky’s
guidance helped him to see past his own preconceptions, allowing him
to see the truth. Since this was the path he had already chosen, the
guidance he was given was enormous beneficial and helped him to
understand his path more clearly than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Daolord
Solesky rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” Ning
put down his brush and hurriedly walked out of the study. Elder God
Wilddog was on duty, awaiting his commands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am going to go to
the Waveshift world now,” Daolord Solesky said. “After I leave,
it’ll all be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
me, big brother. When you go to the Waveshift world, you need to be
careful and stay safe.” Ning was worried as well. During the past
three years, Ning had gotten a better sense of how dangerous the
Waveshift world was. It was unfathomably more dangerous than the
Windsource Ruins had been, and even Daolord Solesky would be in
danger of dying in there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! This old man
plans to succeed in the Daomerge. How could I possibly let myself die
in the Waveshift world?” Daolord Solesky laughed loudly, then
strode away into the skies. An azure-robed figure was already waiting
for him high in the air. This was Daolord Badlands’ avatar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble, brother Badlands,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’ve never
gone into the core regions of the Waveshift world either. Now that
you are here, I can do a bit more exploring than I’ve done in the
past.” Daolord Badlands’ avatar smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two transformed
into streaks of light, disappearing into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched them
from afar. After having spent three years with Daolord Solesky, he
knew that the man truly did view him as he would a brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come back alive, big
brother.” Ning murmured these words softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky had
said that if everything went perfectly smoothly in the Waveshift
world, he would be able to return in four or five years. If he ended
up trapped, it could easily be hundreds of millions of years or even
a hundred chaos cycles before he managed to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Flamefairy,
and Elder God Wilddog continued to live within the Badlands Court.
They slowly became familiar with the other cultivators who lived
here, and Ning would even spend some time dueling with other
cultivators of the Dao of the Sword. One of the competitions resulted
in quite a bit of hubbub, because every single Elder God and
Ancestral Immortal sword-wielder of the Badlands Court ended up being
defeated by Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that all of them used extremely ordinary swords and very little
force; it was merely a contest of Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, even
World-level experts got interested and involved. Now that Ning had
begun to understand prime essence of the sword, only World-level
experts who were truly skilled in the Dao of the Sword were able to
suppress him…and they were only able to suppress, not defeat. The
cultivators of the Badlands Court couldn’t help but sigh to
themselves, “Brother Darknorth is most likely going to become a
World God through the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life was relaxed but
quite fulfilling. Time passed on, year after year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years. Five
years. Ten years. Fifty years. A hundred years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
quiet life here at the Badlands Court, but Daolord Solesky still had
yet to return.

Chapter 13 - The Mysterious Treasure Auction
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated atop
a levitating wooden bridge, lazily fishing. A voice suddenly rang
out, badly startling him. He hurriedly turned his head, realizing
that an azure-robed figure had just appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning greets you,
Daolord.” Ning hurriedly rose to his feet. It was Daolord Badlands!
Ning’s heart clenched. After having spent more than a hundred years
here at the Badlands Court, he had grown quite used to this place and
become very familiar with many of its World Gods, Chaos Immortals,
Elder Gods, and Ancestral Immortals. However, he had never met
Daolord Badlands a second time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that Daolord
Badlands rarely showed his face in the Badlands Court. Millions of
years often passed without a single appearance! However, he was
actually one of the more visible Daolords. Some Samsara Daolords
would only reveal themselves within their own clans a single time
during each chaos cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When there was such an
absolute disparity in power, it became hard for people to become
friends and hold conversations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Solesky
asked me to pass you a message.” Daolord Badlands looked at Ning.
“He probably won’t be able to make it out of there any time soon.
Your return to Vastheaven Palace will be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t be able
to make it out of there any time soon?” Ning was startled. He asked
nervously, “Daolord, my big brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t have to
worry.” Daolord Badlands smiled. “He isn’t in much danger, but
both him and my avatar are going to be trapped for a while. It’ll
probably take at least a million years to make it out of the
formation we are currently trapped in, and there will be more dangers
to come!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Catch.” Daolord
Badlands tossed a black talisman over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
talisman. This talisman only had two rippling waves carved onto it.
One wave looked fast while the other looked slow and calm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Badlands
insignia,” Daolord Badlands said. “I’ve set down restrictive
spells upon it, ensuring that it can only be bound once. Anyone who
has the Badlands insignia is equivalent in status to a formal member
of the Badlands Court. In the Badlands Territory, it’ll be of some
use to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Daolord.”
Ning hurriedly expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had naturally heard
of the Badlands insignia before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With this insignia in
hand, not even figures like God Emperor Blacklotus would dare to
touch him. Although his status as a disciple of Vastheaven Palace was
even more incredible, Vastheaven Palace was too far away. Almost
nobody in the Badlands Territory even knew what Vastheaven Palace
was. In fact, not even many of the disciples of the Badlands Court
knew about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Similarly, not many of
the members of Vastheaven Palace had ever heard of the Badlands
Court. The Daolords of each organization generally wouldn’t give
the other members such detailed maps, for fear that they might end up
running too far away and getting lost, never to be able to make it
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
powerful Daolords of Vastheaven Palace, the Badlands Court, and other
similar organizations all knew each other. Thus, many Samsara
Daolords would be unwilling to attack Ning once they realized who
Ning was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful World-level
experts generally weren’t afraid of other World-level experts. If
they weren’t able to win, they would be able to flee! They only
feared Samsara Daolords…and that’s when having a powerful
organization as a backer made all the difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, you also had
to understand what the relationship was between your enemy and your
own organization. God Emperor Blacklotus had foolishly reported that
he was the disciple of Daolord Seven Sovereigns, but what he didn’t
know was that Daolord Seven Sovereigns was mortal enemies with
Daolord Solesky…and had been so terrified by Daolord Solesky that
he had fled long ago. Blacklotus reporting his affiliation only
resulted in him dying even quicker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on, day by
day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to live
within the Badlands Court. He was in no rush to go out adventuring,
because he was currently growing stronger at a break-neck pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seventh Cycle of
the [Starseizing Hand] had started to take form long ago. Thanks to
Daolord Solesky’s guidance, it had truly come into being.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using up a few
dozen cubes worth of chaos jewels and the Heavengazer Tower, Ning had
already mastered the middle portion of the [Golden Idol] as well. His
body was now comparable to a top-grade Chaos treasure, the same level
which World God Northrest had reached all those years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two
accomplishments had been relatively simple ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning
continued to live peacefully here at the Badlands Court was because
he now had a completely different way of viewing the Dao of the
Sword. He was improving incredibly fast and had yet to encounter a
bottleneck! Generally speaking, cultivators would only go out
adventuring when they had reached a bottleneck in their cultivation.
Only by seeing and experiencing more things would they be able to
more easily break through those bottlenecks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, senior
apprentice-brother Threecold is planning to pay a visit to the
Azuresky Territory’s Startower region and give it a go. Anyone who
wants to go with him can go seek him out. Any interest?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Azuresky
Territory? The Startower region?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It’s not too
far away from our Badlands territory. The legends say that the
Startower region was created when an ancient power tossed out a
tower-shaped magic treasure and left it there in the primordial
chaos. The tower drew in energy from the primordial chaos, creating
an entire region of incredible power around itself. I hear that even
Samsara Daolords will visit that place in the hopes of finding and
acquiring that magic tower. Unfortunately, none of them have been
able to master it to date. The treasures and techniques it contains
are enough to satisfy World-level experts like us. Want to go? Senior
apprentice-brother Threefrost is very powerful. If we go with him,
it’ll be much safer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t wish to
leave for now. Thank you for asking, brother Sevencolor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Sevencolor
exchanged a few more words with Ning, then departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the most powerful
organization within the entire Badlands Territory, the Badlands Court
was quite strict on accepting new disciples. New disciples had to be
tremendously talented, and most were World-level experts. The Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals who made it in were all monstrously
talented, and so most of the World-level experts of the Badlands
Court were able to reach the level of full mastery and become
master-class World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching this
level, the next breakthrough would result in them becoming Samsara
Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
independent World-level experts in the outside world, but only a few
of them would ever reach the level of full mastery. However, the vast
majority of the disciples of the Badlands Court would become
master-class World Gods! Thus, all of them were filled with
exuberance and valor. They wished to go out and adventure, in the
process discovering their own Daos and becoming Samsara Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost everyone at
Fogstone had given up and had chosen to live a peaceful, comfortable
life. Everyone in the Badlands Court, however, is still fighting hard
for their dreams.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, what he didn’t
understand was that in truth there were also some members of the
Badlands Court who had fought long and hard, yet remained unable to
break through and so had given up. They were tired. They had lost
their energy, their passion, and so they chose to leave the Badlands
Court and find another place where they would live in peace. Those
who decided to remain in the Badlands Court were the ones who were
filled with energy and motivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the real
reason why so many members of the Badlands Court would often venture
out into new places. Each time they did so, they would usually
announce it to their peers and try to recruit others to go with them.
If four of five of them joined forces, they would stand a much better
chance of surviving their adventures! Brothers from the same
organization were more unified and generally more trustworthy than
outsiders, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m beginning to
solve the riddle of the third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the
Great Firmament stance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m improving very
rapidly. When I reach a bottleneck or when I master this third
stance, I’ll travel to the Allgod Estate. When I do that, I’ll
let everyone in the Badlands Court know and invite some of them to
accompany me,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod Estate…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the
Windsource Ruins, the only place in the entire Badlands Territory
which had a copy of a Mirrorsnow Painting was the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred and sixty-one
years after Ning arrived at the Badlands Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are about to
start a treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news quickly spread
throughout the entire Badlands Court, causing quite a stir.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master! Master!”
Flamefairy Su Youji came running into the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
was in the middle of practicing some calligraphy and meditating on
his sword-arts. He put down his quill, looking up towards Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just received word
of something.” Su Youji’s oval face was pink and lovely. Her eyes
were very bright, and she extruded an aura of natural charm. Thus,
she was quite a popular figure within the Badlands Court and made
many friends. In contrast, Elder God Wilddog was always a cold,
unfriendly figure. He didn’t make many friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety-nine years
from now, the Palace Opulentia will be hosting a Treasure Auction,”
Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure auction?”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There will be many
treasures to buy, and whoever offers the most money will take the
treasures home. Many treasures which normally are never available for
sale will be on display.” Su Youji was quite excited. “I heard
that these auctions are only hosted ten times per chaos cycle. Each
time, almost all of the World-level experts of the entire Badlands
Territory will gather around it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that all
sorts of treasure will be offered for sale, including Eternal weapons
and some treasures that are even more marvelous than Eternal
weapons.” Su Youji was incredibly excited. “Master, we have to go
take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that in every
single territory, including the Badlands Territory and the Vastheaven
Territory, ten treasure auctions would be held during each chaos
cycle! All sorts of valuable treasures would emerge for the many
cultivators in that territory to bid on. These weren’t treasures
that belonged to the Badlands Court or the Vastheaven Palace; rather,
they were treasures delivered to this place by another mysterious
organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The organization would
send a Daolord to host each auction. Ten times per chaos cycle, the
Daolord would come here to the Badlands Court and host a treasure
auction. The Palace Opulentia merely loaned out their own auction
grounds for this mysterious organization to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any treasures that were
not purchased during the auction would all be taken away at the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This mysterious
organization is spread throughout almost every single territory,”
Ning mused to himself. “Every single territory has these auctions.
Mm. I absolutely cannot miss this one. If I do, it’ll be countless
years before the next one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll need
to hurry up and sell off the treasures I acquired in the Windswept
Ruins. I need to prepare some money for the upcoming treasure
auction.” Ning’s eyes were filled with eagerness.

Chapter 14 - The Gathering
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a blazing hot
planet. The surface of this planet was filled with lakes of lava and
magma.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. One
particular lake of lava could be seen bubbling and hissing as a
gigantic head could be seen slowly bobbing up and down at the banks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant sleeping
creature opened his crimson eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Treasure
auction?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous creature
that had been lying within the flows of lava suddenly transformed
into a streak of light, flying over to the nearby shores and
transforming into a handsome, barefoot man. A set of fiery red robes
appeared over his body as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasure auction
for the Badlands Territory will begin ninety-two years from now?” A
simian red light could be seen flickering in the man’s eyes. “Not
too far away. Hmph. I’ve wandered through quite a few Daolord ruins
over the past ten chaos cycles, and I finally managed to find an
Eternal weapon for myself! If I sell both it and the other Eternal
weapon I acquired all those years ago, I might be able to purchase a
‘Pseudo Samsara’ pill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Pseudo Samsara
pill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to get it, no
matter the cost!” The handsome man gritted his teeth, then
transformed into a streak of fiery light and disappeared into the
heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure auction?
It’ll be in the Waveshift City of the Badlands Everworld?
Eighty-six years from now?” A beautiful woman dressed in elaborated
white robes was seated atop a towering throne. She smiled as she
spoke in a soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sect Mistress,
you’ve been in secluded meditation this entire time and so I didn’t
dare to disturb you. If you didn’t emerge by the final year, I
would’ve been forced to disrupt your session. Thankfully, that
wasn’t necessary.” A woman dressed in a beautiful violet robed
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally managed to
store up three thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Hopefully, this time
I’ll be able to buy the treasures I need.” The white-robed woman
mused softly, “I’ll be comparable to supreme World Gods if I
succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure auction?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go check it
out and see if there’s anything we can afford that would be of use
to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three World-level
experts who had entered seclusion together within a chaosworld had
decided to make haste to the Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the Badlands
Court released the news of the auction, the word quickly spread
throughout the entire Badland Territory. As for the major
organizations who were headquartered in Waveshift City, they
naturally became the first to find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
this information also spread out to some of the nearby territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why it had
been announced ninety-nine years in advance was to give everyone
enough time to receive word of this auction, then travel to the
Badlands Everworld. Some had actually come all the way from
neighboring territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient city of
Waveshift was growing more and more lively by the day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New, unfamiliar World
Gods and Chaos Immortals began to gather here. Some of them belonged
to the Badlands Territory. However, the more famous World-level
experts in the Badlands Territory were figures who had lost their
courage and determination, choosing to live peaceful lives of luxury.
Most of the figures who were still dedicated to their Dao and
improving themselves spent all of their time adventuring through the
primordial chaos, resulting in very few Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals knowing about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, some of
the unfamiliar cultivators had come here from the neighboring
territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, when
nightfall comes, the treasure auction shall begin.” The skinny,
grim-looking Elder God Wilddog was following behind Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
sight.” The nearby Flamefairy let out an amazed sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies had already
begun to darken. This everworld had been created by an ancient power,
but it also had cycles of day and night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Palace
Opulentia was a dazzling, eye-catching sight. Streams of light
swirled around him, and it was the most dazzling, beautiful building
located within the entire Waveshift City. Many World Gods and Chaos
Immortals were currently in the process of entering the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s usually quite
rare for us to encounter a World God or Chaos Immortal, but we are
swarming with them today.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we are.
More than half of the World-level experts of the entire Badlands
Territory have arrived, as well as some from other nearby
territories.” Su Youji was extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We
should go inside as well.” As Ning spoke, he led Su Youji and Elder
God Wilddog into the Palace Opulentia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace Opulentia
was extremely noisy today, and it had a World God and Chaos Immortal
standing guard outside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please enter, fellow
Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please enter, fellow
Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two disciples of
the Badlands Court smiled as they welcomed the guests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the World Gods
and Chaos Immortals who had come to take part in the treasure
auction, they were all courteous as they responded to the greetings.
This was the territory of the Badlands Court, after all, and Daolord
Badlands’ reputation in this territory and the neighboring
territories was quite stunning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone below the
World level, come this way.” A female attendant was leading the way
for the weaker cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, there are so
many World-level powers here!” A True Immortal was following behind
an Elder God in terror. This Elder God was quite famous in their
homeland, but he was currently walking forward nervously for fear of
accidentally offending someone. “Just follow me.” The Elder God
was behaving quite obediently and he followed the female attendant
into the side door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure
auction will be an extraordinary one. All of the treasures up for
sale are quite extraordinary, but space is limited. Anyone below the
World level has to prove that he has at least ten cubes of chaos
nectar before being granted entry. I hope you can understand, fellow
Daoist.” Beyond the side door were two female attendants, and one
of them spoke out courteously to the Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally,
naturally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful. This way,
fellow Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace Opulentia
kept things in perfect order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World-level experts
were allowed to enter the bidding grounds, but Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had to be tested. Otherwise, the spectators would
end up squeezing out all of the actual bidders!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
led the fiery and dazzling Su Youji as well as the grim, icy-cold
Elder God Wilddog towards the palace as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone below the
World level, come this way.” A female attendant came to greet them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the two
disciples of the Badlands Court stationed outside the palace noticed
this sight. The Chaos Immortal immediately walked over and barked,
“Step back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female attendant
was badly shocked. She was nothing more than a hired employee, not a
real disciple of the Badlands Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
why didn’t you come alongside the rest of my fellow disciples?”
The Chaos Immortal laughed. This was Immortal Sevencolor, who was one
of the disciples of the Badlands Court who was on the most friendly
terms with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to check
the place out so I came out for a stroll There really are a lot of
World-level experts today,” Ning said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes there are. You
normally would never see this many of them in one place. Only the
treasure auction can possibly attract so many World-level figures
from all the nearby territories. In fact, even Daolords have come.”
Immortal Sevencolor lowered his voice conspiratorially when he said
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
surprised. Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you can
go straight to the third floor. That’s the place we’ve reserved
for ourselves. No need to waste your time in the main hall
downstairs,” Immortal Sevencolor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “You can go back now. I know you are very busy today!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Immortal
Sevencolor chuckled, then hurriedly returned to the palace entrance.
As for Ning, he led Su Youji and Elder God Wilddog into the Palace
Opulentia through the main gates. This caused some of the nearby
Chaos Immortals and World Gods to stare at him in a somewhat puzzled
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way, brother
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
disciples of the Badlands Court maintaining order inside the palace
as well. When they saw Ning, they immediately came to greet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go straight
to the third floor, brother Darknorth.” Ning was guided straight to
the third floor which had many private rooms within it. This was
where the disciples of the Badlands Court were going to stay, and
Ning was given a room of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Su Youji, and
Elder God Wilddog entered their room. They were able to see through
an enormous window to the great hall below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hall below them was
filled with many seats that were occupied by World Gods and Chaos
Immortals, with the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals seated to the
rear. There were quite a few rooms available on the second floor, but
one had to spend ten cubes of chaos nectar in order to claim one. Ten
cubes of chaos nectar was enough to purchase a Dao weapon. This was
flat out extortion! Thus, 99% of World Gods and Chaos Immortals
elected to sit in the great hall below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tiny fraction who
truly did not wish to reveal themselves chose to sit on the second
floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top floor of the
hall was quite spacious. A white-robed women was seated in the lotus
position, and a stick of incense had been placed next to her. The
scent of the incense swirled around her, emanating a sense of utter
peacefulness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand Shadows.”
Two figures walked in from outside. It was the azure-robed Daolord
Badlands and his beautiful wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands. Little
sister Yan’er.” The white-robed woman nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dracogod came as
well,” Daolord Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dracogod?” The
seated woman frowned slightly when she heard the name, a slightly
disgusted look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, a man
of noble demeanor dressed in golden robes walked in. He looked very
poised and had a few scales on his forehead. This was Daolord
Dracogod. When he saw the white-robed woman, he smiled. “Fairy
Thousand Shadows! I didn’t expect you to be the one in charge of
escorting the treasures this time. If I knew, I would’ve come to
help out instead of letting you go to all this trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t dare to
ask you to help,” the white-robed woman said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dracogod
chuckled, but a hint of ice could be seen in his smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands and
his wife exchanged a glance. There was nothing they could do. Due to
a ‘dragonification fruit’, a feud had sprung up between Daolord
Dracogod and Daolord Thousand Shadows. Most likely, if they were
meeting anywhere else, they would already be trying to kill each
other.

Chapter 15 - The Treasure Auction Begins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.” A
loud laugh rang out as an azure-robed man with deer antlers on his
head walked in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Daoist
Azuresky! I didn’t expect you to join this treasure auction.”
Daolord Dracogod was the first to respond in a very warm fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old brother
Azuresky.” Daolord Badlands and his wife greeted him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The antlered
man smiled and nodded at Daolord Badlands and his wife, then glanced
at Daolord Dracogod. Finally, he turned his gaze towards the
white-robed woman. He smiled. “Thousand Shadows, I heard that you
were the one responsible for escorting the treasures this time. My
Azuresky Territory is pretty close to this place, so I came to come
visit my old friends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has indeed been
quite some time.” The white-robed female Daolord nodded slowly, a
hint of a smile on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
powerful figure of the surrounding territories, Azuresky. Azuresky
was another major power who was at the Verge of the Daomerge, but his
Azuresky Sect didn’t have any powerful Daolords that could help
assume the mantle of leadership. Given that he still had plenty of
time left, Daolord Azuresky spent most of his time slowly
accumulating more power and experience, planning on attempting the
Daomerge sometime in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A gust of wind
blew past, materializing into a figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Thousand Shadows.” A short old man dressed in short sleeves beamed
merrily and called out at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Waterwind.” The white-robed woman had acted in quite an aloof
manner thus far, but she now hurriedly rose to her feet and walked
over towards that short old man and grabbed his hand. “Big brother
Waterwind, it’s almost impossible for me to find you. The only
reason I accepted this mission to the Badlands Territory was because
I thought I might be able to see you. And now, I really have!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, your big
brother just loves to go wandering around the world,” Waterwind
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long time no see,
Waterwind.” Daolord Badlands smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Badlands.”
Waterwind nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory
actually held four Daolords. However, most of them rarely showed
their faces, and so most Elder Gods, Ancestral Immortals, and
World-level figures only knew of Daolord Badlands. They didn’t know
any of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Daolords of
the Badlands Territory were Daolord Badlands, his wife, Daolord
Waterwind, and Daolord Cavefloat. Daolord Cavefloat was somewhat
weak, while Waterwind was extremely lazy. Waterwind had no interest
in setting up his own sect whatsoever, preferring to wander the
primordial chaos by himself. In terms of strength, however, he was a
formidable figure who was absolutely on par with Daolord Badlands
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five Daolords on
the top level, the strongest was Daolord Azuresky. Daolord Badlands
and Daolord Waterwind were ranked second, while Daolord Thousand
Shadows and Daolord Dracogod were even weaker. As for Daolord
Badlands’ wife, she was the weakest one of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, not
many Daolords would be drawn to any given treasure auction; it was
normal for four or five to attend at most. This was because these
treasure auctions were mainly meant to let World-level experts have a
chance to buy some fairly rare items. However, each treasure auction
would also hold a few items that would make even Daolords feel
envious, which was why they would often come and see if there was
anything they fancied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Daoist
Azuresky.” Daolord Dracogod behaved in an extremely friendly
manner, repeatedly referring to Azuresky as as ‘brother Daoist’.
This caused Waterwind to purse his lips in disdain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Waterwind was a
solitary man who wandered as he pleased, Dracogod was the exact
opposite. He curried favor with everyone around him and enjoyed
making friends with the most powerful Daolords he could find! Daolord
Solesky and Daolord Azuresky both were at the Verge of the Daomerge
and were extremely frightening figures of tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they failed their
Daomerge, it was guaranteed that they would eventually perish.
However, if they went berserk before they died, they would prove to
be a terrifying foe for anyone to encounter. Who would dare
antagonize someone who knew that death was coming no matter what? Not
even ancient powers who had succeeded in their Daomerge and gained
eternity would be willing to antagonize Daolords who had failed in
their Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dracogod
delighted in befriending the top-tier Daolords, doing everything in
his power to curry favor with them. And as a result, he really did
end up making quite a few friends. Generally speaking, no matter
where he went, the other Daolords would give him some face. However,
many solitary wanderers like Daolord Waterwind would feel very
disdainful towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasure auction
is beginning.” Daolord Thousand Shadows glanced downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Su Youji, and
Wilddog peered out through their giant window towards the great hall
below them. The hall didn’t look that large from the outside, but
it was actually ten kilometers in size. Tens of thousands of
cultivators were seated around the central auctioning platform. Most
of the people present were World Gods and Chaos Immortals, with a few
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals who were allowed in had to have at least ten
cubes of chaos nectar in wealth. The chairs were all seated a fair
distance from each other as there was ten kilometers worth of space
here. But of course, all of them had such perfect vision that they
could see ants crawling on the ground from ten kilometers away with
absolute clarity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, it has
begun.” Su Youji hurriedly pointed downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
looked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three female Chaos
Immortals dressed in marvelous floral robes walked out to the central
auction platform. Their leader was a woman whose skin looked like it
had been carved out of ice, and her eyes were a steely silver color.
This silver-eyed woman stood there in the center, the other two
standing by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Welcome,
distinguished cultivators and guests from many different territories.
I shall be the one in charge of this treasure auction.” The
silver-eyed woman had a smile on her face. “I imagine all of you
are tired of waiting, so I won’t waste any time. Let the auction
begin! The rules to the auction are quite simple. Every single
treasure will have a reserve price, and every bid has to be at least
one cube of chaos nectar higher than the previous bid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let the
first item be brought out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed woman
waved her crystalline, frozen arm. Instantly, a dried yellow wooden
slip appeared in her hands, then levitated into the air. It rose to a
height of roughly thirty meters, so as to allow all of the
cultivators a clear line of sight to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a piece of
Soulguide Wood.” The silver-eyed woman smiled. “Soulguide Wood.
Once it is lit, it will completely ignite and transform into a
certain type of smoke. If you completely inhale all of the smoke,
you’ll enter a deep slumber for a thousand years. Any cultivators
whose hearts have been cast into shadow due to some event will find
the shadow to be dramatically weakened and no longer pose a threat to
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soulguide Wood has a
reserve price of twelve cubes of chaos nectar. Let the auction
begin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifteen cubes! The
first bidder was an Elder God whose eyes were filled with desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixteen cubes.” A
gray-robed Chaos Immortal called out calmly from a different part of
the hall. The Elder God immediately gritted his teeth helplessly. The
reason why he had immediately increased the bid to fifteen cubes was
because he wanted to scare off any bidders…but alas, everyone knew
just how valuable Soulguide Wood was. How many Elder Gods could
possibly win a bidding war against World-level figures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventeen cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighteen cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as the
bidding proceeded, rather surprised. “Soulguide Wood? I didn’t
expect the first treasure to be such a valuable one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When cultivators
encountered certain types of setbacks, every so often a shadow would
be cast over their heart. Sometimes, the shadow would be as strong as
a demonheart curse. This would constantly disturb and nag at the
cultivator, worrying away at him. Even if he was able to suppress it,
he wouldn’t be able to be truly at peace when meditating on the
Dao, making it much more difficult for him to grow more powerful.
However, Soulguide Wood would send the cultivator into a
thousand-year slumber. Upon awakening, the cultivator would feel as
though the shadow cast over his heart was something that had happened
long, long ago. He would barely be able to remember it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was quite a
marvelous treasure. Although it was comparable in value to most Dao
weapons, it was incredibly rare. Normally, if a person wished to
purchase this item within the Palace Opulentia, the Palace Opulentia
would charge an extortionate price to help them even locate the item.
The price would start off at fifty cubes at least! Sometimes, even
organizations like the Badlands Court would find it difficult to
acquire, making it truly expensive to purchase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the prices
offered at these treasure auctions were much lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
even Daolords would come and take a look. They wanted to see if they
could pick up something cheap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-two cubes.
Any higher bids?” The silver-eyed woman glanced at the surrounding
cultivators. “Since there are no higher bids…” As she spoke,
the Soulguide Wood slowly began to float downwards. When it landed in
her hand, it represented this particular bidding cycle as having been
completed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Soulguide Wood
landed in her hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well then. The
Soulguide Wood is sold at thirty-two cubes,” the silver-eyed woman
said. The woman behind her immediately walked forward, accepting the
Soulguide Wood and then taking it off the auction platform. She
walked to the Elder God who had placed the final bid of thirty-two
cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soulguide Wood was
something which many Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were
desperately in need of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
higher one’s level of insight into the Dao was, the more powerful
their hearts were. It was very rare for World-level experts to have
their hearts troubled by the demonheart, and even if they were the
problem wouldn’t be resolvable through usage of Soulguide Wood. If
they truly did wish to buy Soulguide Wood, they could just spend
fifty cubes to buy it at a later point in time. It was slightly
cheaper now, which was why the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
present were desperate to buy it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the World-level
experts had merely watched. It wasn’t yet time for them to make
bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he also
just watched from the third floor as well. He had sold off quite a
few treasures for the sake of this treasure auction, precisely
because he was waiting for rare, powerful items he needed to show up!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 16 - Wings
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the time he
had spent in the Badlands Court, Ji Ning understood that each
treasure auction would have many treasures for sale. Treasures of
every single type would be sold, and so Ning sold off the vast
majority of the treasures he had acquired in the Windsource Ruins. He
had been planning on keeping the Eversnow Banner and the Rainbow
Cloud World, but he ended up selling them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eversnow Banner was
quite useful. It had several sinfiends within it and could be used to
trap enemies or test out dangerous regions. However, Ning deeply
disliked sin treasures. He had planned on temporarily using it since
he had a deficit of good treasures, but now that an abundance of
treasures was coming towards him he was naturally going to sell it
off to buy things he actually liked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Rainbow
Cloud World was a domain-type artifact, Ning had no insights into the
Dao of Mist at all. There was no way for Ning to even bind the layers
of seals held within the Dao weapon and so he was only able to
unleash a tiny fraction of its true power. He naturally chose to sell
it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eversnow Banner
alone had been sold off for more than 150 cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short…Ning had
sold off almost all of the treasures of those three World-level
experts, save for the Mirrorsnow Painting and Rocky the stone titan.
He had sold these treasures off to the Badlands Court, and since he
was their respected guest they didn’t try to make much money off of
him. Ning was able to earn a total of 1580 cubes of chaos nectar.
This was an enormous sum of money! However, it wouldn’t be that
impressive in the context of the treasure auction, and so he had to
be very careful in how he spent his wealth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel and the
Mirrorsnow Painting are worth incredible amounts of chaos nectar, but
they are very important to me.” Ning continued to stare through the
window towards the great hall below him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great hall was
still filled with tens of thousands of seated cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed woman
took out one treasure after another, arousing waves of excited
discussions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
six hours had gone past. This was nothing more than the start, as
every single treasure auction would go on for nearly ten days.
Between the explanation phase and the bidding phase, every single
treasure would take quite a bit of time. Even after a full day of
auctioning, only a few hundred treasures had been sold off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure.”
The silver-eyed woman waved her hand, causing a white pair of wings
to appear in her palms. The tiny, delicate little wings quickly flew
into the air and began to expand in size. When it reached a height of
thirty meters, it was roughly as tall as a normal human. It emanated
waves of strange ripples as it constantly phased in and out of
existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a high-grade
Dao treasure known as the Voidsea Wings. It is filled with many
divine runes that embody the profound mysteries of space and is
suitable for cultivators who cultivate the Dao of Spacetime.” The
silver-eyed woman continued, “With this set of wings, you’ll be
able to fly incredibly fast. When engaged in close combat, you’ll
be able to move much more agilely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea Wings
have a reserve price of thirty cubes of chaos nectar. Let the bidding
begin!” The silver-eyed woman called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-one cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-five cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, quite a few
cultivators began to fight over the treasure. Treasures that could
increase one’s agility in combat were actually very important,
especially since they could also be vital when fleeing from danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These wings could allow
one to fly much faster and also made one much more agile. Although it
was merely a high-grade Dao treasure, it was even more rare and
valuable than most top-grade Dao weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, don’t you
need treasures like this?” Su Youji asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait for a
bit longer. I imagine there will be even better treasures later.”
Ning frowned. He did want a set of wings, because his path was the
path of close combat, but his greatest skill lay in the Dao of the
Sword. Although he did have some insights into lightning, water, and
space, they were significantly weaker than his insights into the Dao
of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, his
most powerful Dao was the Dao of the Sword, the second was the Dao of
Lightning, the third was the Dao of Water, and the last one was the
Dao of Space…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine runes that
had been imprinted into those Voidsea Wings were undoubtedly quite
abstruse and profound. Given his limited skill in the Dao of Space,
he probably would only be able to unleash a fraction of the full
power of that set of wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty-nine cubes.
Any higher bids?” The silver-eyed woman glanced at the surrounding
people as the pair of wings in the air began to slowly descend from
its height of thirty meters, shrinking as it did so. Finally, it
landed in her palms. “The auction is complete. The Voidsea Wings
have been sold for sixty-nine cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the female
Immortals behind her immediately took the wings and delivered them to
the winning bidder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
watch. He had yet to make a single bid, because there was nothing
that had truly excited him thus far. There was no need for him to buy
a treasure that wasn’t a perfect fit for him. With enough chaos
nectar on hand, he would have plenty of other chances to purchase
what he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If push comes to
shove, I’ll buy a boat-type treasure that’s meant for fleeing,”
Ning mused to himself. “Even if I’m not as agile as I would be
with those wings, my sword-arts will ensure that I have nothing to
fear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his backup
plan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure auction
continued for another two hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the fifth
set of wings to appear in this treasure auction. This is also a pair
of high-grade Dao wings, and it is known as the Thunderlight Wings.”
The silver-eyed woman waved her hand as her voice echoed within the
great hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thunderlight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ears twitched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
mastering a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent, Ning had transformed his body
to give it an even higher affinity for lightning than Exalted
Celestial Thundergod. His improvement in the Dao of Lightning was
quite fast, on the same level as his improvement in the element of
water. It was second only to the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ning
stared from afar as a set of azure wings appeared in the silver-eyed
woman’s hands. The wings appeared to spark and hum with electric
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thunderlight Wings
are powered by lightning and use sword-light to tear through all
obstacles, allowing the wielder to move at tremendous speeds. It is
highly suited for both close combat and evasive techniques. It is a
perfect fit for cultivators who are skilled in both the Dao of the
Sword and the Dao of Lightning,” the silver-eyed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shot up, his eyes
gleaming as he stared through the window. “That’s the one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thunderlight Wings
were actually even tougher to use than the Voidsea Wings. There were
quite a few cultivators who were skilled in the Dao of Space, the Dao
of Lightning, and the Dao of the Sword, but fairly few who were
skilled in both the sword and in lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, a treasure
which was able to join together two different Daos would generally be
even more astonishingly powerful than ‘normal’ treasures of that
type.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thunderlight
Wings have a reserve price of thirty-six cubes of chaos nectar. Let
the bidding begin,” the silver-eyed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-eight cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forty-five cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few World Gods
began to make their bids, the price rising much faster than the price
for the Voidsea Wings had. Although fewer cultivators were able to
use these Thunderlight Wings, there were so many World Gods present
that there were multiple figures here who were skilled in both
lightning and the sword. Under normal circumstances, Waveshift City
didn’t have many Dao treasures for sale. Wing-type Dao treasures
were even rarer, and dual-affinity ones such as this almost never
showed up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bidding war is
pretty fierce.” Ning frowned slightly, then spoke out and made his
first bid. “Fifty cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice rang out from
the third floor, causing quite a few cultivators to turn their heads
in his direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the third
floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must be a
disciple of the Badlands Court.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he is?
Fifty-two cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty-five cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty-five cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bidding war grew
increasingly intense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy-two cubes.”
Ning raised the price, making his second bid. This pair of wings were
extremely hard to design and quite complicated to forge. They rarely
showed up in the marketplace. If he used them, his ability and his
speed would both increase dramatically. Ning would not accept no for
an answer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy-three
cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy-four cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bidding speed began
to slow down. There was a limit to how much anyone would pay for a
high-grade Dao treasure; in the end, they could try to find and buy
one during the next treasure auction. Waveshift City would hold ten
of them each chaos cycle, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy-six cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned slightly,
then spoke out for a third time. “Eighty cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire hall fell
silent. No further bids came. Eighty cubes appeared to be the
ceiling. It must be understood that the stone titan Ning had acquired
was itself worth merely a hundred cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty cubes. Any
higher bids?” The set of azure Thunderlight Wings continued to
hover above the silver-eyed woman, but a moment later it began to
slowly descend. Finally, it landed in her hands. “Bidding is now
closed. The Thunderlight Wings have been sold for eighty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the third floor,
Ning let out a sigh of a relief and revealed a hint of a smile. The
highest possible price he was willing to pay was actually a hundred
cubes of chaos nectar. Other cultivators and World-level experts had
been around for a long time and were willing to wait; there were ten
of these auctions each chaos cycle, after all. They wouldn’t be
willing to pay too high a price. Ning, however, wasn’t willing to
wait. By the time the next treasure auction came around, he would
probably be a World-level expert himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty cubes for a
set of wings that are a perfect fit for me. I’m satisfied.” Ning
secretly celebrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master.” Elder God Wilddog hurriedly congratulated Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master. You were silent for so long, but when you found something you
liked you stopped at nothing to take it.” The Flamefairy smiled as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are just getting
started. This was just a warmup.” Ning grinned. This set of wings
had only cost him eighty cubes of chaos nectar. He had prepared more
than a thousand cubes for this auction, and the best treasures had
yet to appear! Supposedly, there were some treasures that would cause
even Samsara Daolords to grow intrigued.

Chapter 17 - Aquaflect
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One treasure after
another was sold off. Of course, there was also the occasional
treasure which had no bidders at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days of bidding
passed in the blink of an eye, with the cultivators in the hall
growing increasingly excited. Increasingly unique treasures were
beginning to come out, as many of the best treasures had been saved
for last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next treasure
is a suit of armor.” The silver-eyed female Immortal smiled, her
voice echoing within the ears of the tens of thousands of cultivators
present. “This is the most unique set of armor we have for sale in
this treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The eyes of
quite a few people lit up as they began to listen carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning listened
carefully as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most unique set
of armor?” The Daolords seated at the top floor also glanced
downwards towards the great hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Thousand Shadows, what’s so unique about this armor?” Waterwind
asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Daolord
Thousand Shadows smiled. “Just keep watching, big brother. You know
the rules! No leaks are permitted regarding the treasures for sale
during any treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, let’s see
what this treasure is.” Daolord Dracogod smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands and
his wife watched curiously as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Armor as precious as
this is rarely seen during the various treasure auctions that have
been held in these territories during recent chaos cycles. For me, at
least, this is the first time I’m seeing such a precious treasure
appear in an auction that I’m officiating over.” The words of the
silver-eyed woman caused the cultivators present to feel even more
intrigued. What was so rare and special about this armor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine some of
you have heard of this type of armor, but few of you have ever seen
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed woman
waved her crystalline arm, causing a tiny suit of armor to appear in
her palm. As the suit of armor floated into the air, it quickly
expanded in size. The armor looked quite ordinary, but it was covered
by a layer of icy frost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This suit of armor
is known as the Frosthorn Robe.” The silver-eyed woman laughed. “It
is suitable for cultivators skilled in the Dao of Water. It
admittedly looks quite ordinary, and it is nothing more than a suit
of top-grade Dao armor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…it has the
‘reflect damage’ property.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any attacks, close
range or longe range, that land on this suit of armor will result in
an equal amount of damage being reflected onto the attacker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as her words
came out, the entire hall exploded into a shocked clamor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An equal amount of
damage reflected!?” All of the cultivators were stunned. So if an
enemy launched a full-force attack against you, your armor would
automatically cause them to suffer an attack of the exact same level
of power? How would you even try to fight against someone with this
armor in close combat?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With armor like
this, World Gods that are skilled in close combat can even fight back
against experts at a higher level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World Gods generally
all had incredibly tough bodies as well as top-grade Dao armors
protecting them. Generally speaking, even World-level opponents who
were one or two classes of power above them in strength would find it
difficult to annihilate them in one blow. If their opponent was not
only unable to slay them in one blow but would also suffer damage
reflection…even foes stronger than the armor-bearers would find
actually fighting them to be a painful experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to grow
excited as well. This was definitely a set of armor that was perfect
for anyone who specialized in close combat. Ning’s own body was
very tough, especially when reinforced by the azureflower mist
energy. Once he became a World God, he would become even more
formidable in this regard! Him acquiring this set of armor would be
like a tiger being given wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aquaflect?” The
Daolords on the top floor, however, were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it’s just
water-element damage reflection.” Daolord Dracogod frowned.
“Although aquaflect armor is fairly rare, there’s one or two for
sale in every treasure auction. Daolord Thousand Shadows, your
subordinate is bragging a bit too much. Why did she say that this
item is something that is all but unmatched in value in treasure
auctions hosted during recent chaos cycles? She even claimed that
this was the first time she ever encountered such an item while
hosting an auction. Is this her first time being the auction
mistress?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aquaflect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azuresky, Waterwind,
and the Badlands couple were all puzzled as well. While the World
Gods were all excited, this item wasn’t that exciting to Daolords
like them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s hosted at
least a hundred treasure auctions.” Daolord Thousand Shadows gave
Daolord Dracogod a cold sideways glance. “If you aren’t
impressed, don’t bid on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t bid on it?”
Daolord Dracogod was stunned. What was that supposed to mean? Was
there something about this suit of armor that would attract his
interest? Was this a joke? He was a venerable Daolord; all his items
were of the Eternal level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine seals
embedded into this armor are incomparably profound,” the
silver-eyed woman said in a loud voice. “It contains seven layers
of seals. World-level cultivators with complete mastery over water
might be able to completely bind all seven seals…and if they do so,
when they put on these robes they will be able to generate a
Frosthorn Domain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Frosthorn Domain
will span up to ten thousand kilometers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any attacks launched
within this domain will result in full-force damage reflection.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Frosthorn Robes
have a reserve price of five thousand cubes of chaos nectar.” The
silver-eyed woman smiled. “Let the bidding begin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the great
hall was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five thousand?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell is it
so expensive?” Ning had been debating buying the treasure, but he
was instantly stupefied by the price. Five thousand cubes? He didn’t
even have close to that much! And, based on what he knew, ten
thousand cubes was enough to purchase an Eternal weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For even the reserve
price to be so high meant that this treasure was just as valuable as
an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell is it
so expensive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I saw a suit of
aquaflect armor during the last treasure auction as well. It wasn’t
nearly this expensive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is ridiculous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Elder God
Formations start off with a reserve price of around 150 cubes during
these auctions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of thousands
of cultivators in the hall were all silent for a moment. Then, they
started to stealthily discuss this matter amongst themselves. It must
be understood that ordinary top-grade Dao weapons were only worth a
few dozen cubes at most! This was the price which Ning had been given
for the warblade he had sold off. The Eversnow Banner held nine
sinfiends within it, which was why it went for one or two hundred
cubes of chaos nectar. Even complete sets of top-grade Dao weapons
would generally go for a few hundred cubes at most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five thousand cubes?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a price that
would render 99% of World-level experts completely speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten thousand cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve thousand
cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Dracogod, I
thought you weren’t impressed with it? Fifteen thousand cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A rapid-fire series of
bids began to ring out from the top floor of the auction hall.
Everyone, Ning included, felt an enormous sense of pressure pushing
down upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
terrifyingly powerful World Gods here, including some who were
stronger than even World God Northrest. This was a gathering of the
majority of the World-level experts from all the nearby territories,
after all. Some of them were able to afford this price, but…was it
really worth it? For just a top-grade set of Dao armor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Thousand
Shadows, your insights into the element of water aren’t as profound
as mine. Stop fighting with me over this.” Daolord Dracogod
chuckled, then called out once more, “Eighteen thousand cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dracogod, you brat.”
Waterwind spoke out, causing Daolord Dracogod’s face to turn dark.
However, Waterwind was unquestionably more powerful than him. “Stop
fighting with my little sister Thousand Shadows. Although this set of
top-grade Dao armor has seven seals within it, didn’t you hear that
only World-level cultivators who have reached the level of full
mastery over the Dao of Water are able to bind all seven seals? My
little sister is definitely capable of that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wasn’t bound
by the rules of our organization, I would’ve taken this treasure
away long ago. There’s no way I would’ve let it show up on the
floor of the auction hall.” Daolord Thousand Shadows glanced at
Daolord Dracogod. Although she was in charge of this expedition, she
didn’t dare to violate any of the rules. No information regarding
the treasures was to be leaked, and all treasures had to be bid in a
fair fashion during the actual auction itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a rule that
had existed for countless chaos cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty thousand
cubes.” Daolord Thousand Shadows raised the price again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty-one thousand
cubes.” Daolord Dracogod immediately countered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry, Yan’er.
Nothing I can do.” Daolord Badlands looked at his wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. I rarely
go out into battle anyhow.” His beautiful wife laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Frosthorn Domain…who
the hell managed to create something like this?” Daolord Badlands
let out a sigh. “So long as you are in the range of this domain,
each time you launch an attack you’ll immediately suffer from
damage reflection. It’ll only end when you stop trying to attack!
Even though this domain will have less of an impact on a powerful
Daolord, he’ll still see his strength whittled away by more than
half as his attacks travel through it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the Frosthorn
Domain appeared, it would initiate a series of counter-attacks.
Daolords could use the power of the counter-attacks to whittle away
at the strength of the enemy’s blows. This effect alone ensured
that the item would be a valuable one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-eight
thousand cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forty thousand
cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dracogod and
Daolord Thousand Shadows were completely at odds now. As Samsara
Daolords, these two were neither particularly weak nor particularly
strong. This was why they both desperately needed treasures like this
one! As for the likes of Daolord Badlands, Azuresky, or Waterwind,
any foes that might prove to be a threat to them wouldn’t be
threatened by a mere Frosthorn Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty thousand
cubes.” Daolord Thousand Shadows made yet another bid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Daolord
Dracogod’s face was ashen. He had originally planned to just watch
the treasure auction and see if he could pick up something cheap, and
so he hadn’t prepared a particularly large amount of chaos nectar.
However, Daolord Thousand Shadows had been in charge of escorting
this mission! Although she couldn’t tell others about the treasures
under her protection, she herself knew that this suit of armor was
within it. Thus, she had prepared more than enough chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, she wasn’t
really getting much of a bargain, as this was the ‘standard’
price for an item of this nature. However, as the silver-eyed auction
mistress had said…this type of armor was rarely available for sale!
It truly was incredibly rare! It was a fairly cheap yet extremely
effective item for Daolords, perfect for Daolords of average strength
such as the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the
Frosthorn Robe was sold for fifty thousand cubes of chaos nectar. The
many cultivators present were all stunned by this price, especially
the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six more hours passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure is
another set of armor. It is known as the Primalwater Armor, and it
also has the aquaflect property.” The silver-eyed woman continued,
“However, this set of armor only has three seals inside of it, and
so it will only generate the damage reflection property when an
attack actually lands upon it. It won’t generate a domain like the
Frosthorn Domain we previously discussed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she spoke, she waved
her hand and caused a suit of armor to fly out of her palm. This
armor was silvery-white and looked a bit more beautiful than the
Frosthorn Robe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The suit of armor flew
into the air, expanding as it flew upwards. It immediately attracted
the attention of many cultivators, Ning included.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primalwater
Armor’s reserve price is two hundred cubes of chaos nectar. Let the
bidding begin!” The silver-eyed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a more
‘normal’ price!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 18 - Completely Broke
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
silver-eyed woman stopped talking, the cultivators in the hall all
began to call out, especially the World Gods. “Two hundred and
twenty cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two hundred thirty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two hundred forty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price rapidly began
to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, he
watched silently from the third floor even though he also desired
this item quite badly. There were a number of World Gods in the great
hall who were interested but were in no rush to make a bid. Most of
the initial bidders were just trying to see if they could pick it up
on the cheap, as most ‘normal’ top-grade Dao armors would go for
at least three hundred cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Top-grade Dao armor
with the aquaflect property would naturally be worth much more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
twenty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five hundred!”
Suddenly, a deep voice rang out. It came from a muscular alien World
God whose entire body was covered with fiery red scales, and with his
growling bid the price instantly rocketed up to five hundred cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hall grew much
quieter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were ‘customary’
prices for most magic treasures. Ordinary top-grade Dao armor would
go for around three hundred cubes, while something like this
Primalwater Armor would go for around six hundred cubes or so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five hundred and
ten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciples of the
Badlands Court are truly impressive.” Many cultivators turned to
look at the third floor. During this auction, many of the disciples
of the Badlands Court remained silent until they chose to make a bid,
at which point they would stun everyone present. This was their
territory, after all, and everyone would look at them when they bid
from the third floor. They generally wanted to ensure that they would
gain face from their bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred cubes!”
A World God seated in the great hall whose entire body was covered by
a gray robe suddenly spoke out in an icy voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and ten
cubes,” the fire-scaled alien World God snarled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and
twenty cubes,” the gray-robed World God bid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alien World God
hesitated, not sure if he should continue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and
ninety cubes!” Ning made yet another bid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This bid caused two
other hesitating cultivators to fall silent. Ning’s bid had caused
them to both change their minds. Although Primalwater Armor was rare,
one or two would appear during each treasure auction, and they’d
generally go for around six hundred cubes. Sometimes the price would
a bit higher; other times, the price would be a bit lower. Six
hundred and ninety cubes was fairly high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. Later
I’ll go back and buy some World-level golems that can be used in a
formation. They’ll cost the same amount and will be a bit more
useful to me than this armor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few World Gods
began to talk themselves down from joining the bidding. This was an
enormous sum of money, after all. The combined treasures which Ning
had initially acquired from Immortal Origination and Immortal
Bloodpool in the Windsource Ruins weren’t worth as much as this
single suit of armor. The only reason why Ning was able to afford it
was because World God Cavecry had left behind some nice treasures as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and
ninety cubes. Any higher bids?” The silver-eyed woman spoke out as
the suit of armor began to descend towards her palm. Finally, it came
to a rest. “This suit of Primalwater Armor has been sold. The
bidding is over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning let
out a sigh of relief, sitting down and picking up a glass of wine. He
took a small sip of it. Just now, he had been so nervous that he had
jumped to his feet. He knew very well that the only reason why he had
so much chaos nectar was thanks to Daolord Solesky. If it wasn’t
for him, who knew how long it would’ve taken for Ning to acquire so
much wealth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master.” Elder God Wilddog spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine there
aren’t many World Gods who can afford a treasure like this,” Su
Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, for
now, this suit of armor wouldn’t be as helpful to him as seven
hundred cubes worth of bugbeasts or golems. For example, Ning
could’ve purchased thirty-six sinfiends like the ones he had sold
off! Generally speaking, most World-level experts would purchase
quite a few bugbeasts or sets of golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems were magic
treasures that could be deployed in formations, after all. An entire
set of five or six golems in a formation would prove to be
extraordinarily powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.” A
soft voice rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creeeeak. The door
swung open and a woman walked in holding the suit of armor. Smiling,
she said, “Primalwater Armor, six hundred and ninety cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
tossed out a storage treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman accepted it,
glanced at it, then placed the suit of armor on the table and
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out to
gently stroke the suit of silver armor, filling it with his divine
power. He was able to bind it quite easily. Whoosh. The armor
instantly appeared over his body, while the set of high-grade Dao
armor Ning had previously been wearing was put away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have Violetjewel
as my weapon and the Primalwater Armor as my armor. For agility and
evasion, I have the Thunderlight Wings.” Ning nodded slowly to
himself. “Given my sword-arts have improved during this period of
time I spent at the Badlands Court…I’ll wager only master-class
World Gods are capable of suppressing me in might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already used
up nearly half of his chaos nectar. He was in no rush to make any
further bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure auction
continued to proceed day by day, and many new marvelous items
appeared. Ning’s horizons were truly broadened. Only now did he
understand how many treasures the Endless Territories possessed! The
World-level experts he had previously encountered, such as God
Emperor Blacklotus, were actually nothing more than failures. Truly
powerful cultivators would be able to wield their treasures to
absolutely devastating effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the seventh day of
the treasure auction, Ning purchased yet another treasure. A
Pentabolt Gourd!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pentabolt Gourd was
filled with five different types of divine chaos lightning. In truth,
a single one of those five types of lightning was enough to utterly
devastate anyone below the World level of power, but against World
Gods and Chaos Immortals it wouldn’t be of much use. The Pentabolt
Gourd, however, mixed all five types of chaos lightning together. It
was enough to threaten the lives of weaker World-level experts, and
even powerful ones would be entangled and ensnared by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Pentabolt Gourd
can be used to launch group attacks. Even if I can’t kill my foes,
I can slow them down.” Ning nodded to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent a total
of 180 cubes to purchase the Pentabolt Gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth day of the
treasure auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next treasure
is a set of three golems.” The silver-eyed woman waved her hand,
causing three fiery golems to appear in her palms before slowly
levitating into the air. “However, these golems are unlike ordinary
golems! They don’t have any treasure spirits within them, but they
do have a compartment which a cultivator can enter and control them
through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When these three
golems come together into a formation, their defensive powers will
increase exponentially.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This set of golems
has a reserve price of three hundred cubes. Let the bidding begin!”
The silver-eyed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, quite a few
cultivators began to make their bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These golems that could
hold cultivators inside them were very popular amongst Chaos
Immortals. Chaos Immortals had fragile bodies, but when they were
inside golems they would be fairly safe! In addition, golems that
fought on their own usually did so in clumsy ways. Cultivators had
much higher levels of insight into the Dao; when they personally
commanded a golem, it was only natural for the golem to be capable of
much greater power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there was a
weakness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own stone
titan golem was able to fight alongside him; the two were able to
surround and pincer-attack a foe together. If Ning was to enter a
golem, the fight would turn into a one-on-one fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred and
sixty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred and
seventy cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather
nervous. Twelve hours ago, a set of five similar golems had appeared.
Ning had made multiple bids, but in the end the price had risen to
over eight hundred cubes. Ning only had roughly six hundred cubes
left!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to win this
time,” Ning mused to himself. If he let his powerful Elder Gods or
Ancestral Immortals control these three golems, they would actually
be a bit more powerful than the stone titan was. Ning would then have
much more resources at his disposal if he encountered dangerous
situations when adventuring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, Ning had
been planning on buying a Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this treasure
auction, around two hundred cubes would be enough to procure one of
these formations! As for the thousand Elder God slaves needed to
operate it, they could be purchased for a hundred cubes. Three
hundred cubes would translate into an army of Elder God slaves who
were able to join together into a formation. However, by comparison
the set of three golems was even more attractive to Ning, even though
they were somewhat more expensive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five hundred cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five hundred and ten
cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price continued to
rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred cubes!”
Ning said. He only had a bit over six hundred cubes left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A momentary silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed woman
glanced at the people nearby, then said, “Six hundred cubes of
chaos nectar. Any higher bids?” The three golems began to slowly
descend from midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and ten
cubes!” Suddenly, a green-robed Chaos Immortal located in the
corner of the hall gritted his teeth and place a bid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and
twenty cubes!” Ning almost immediately raised his bid once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed Chaos
Immortal raised his head to glance at Ning. He didn’t say a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed woman
continued to ask for more bidders as the three golems began their
descent. Finally, they landed in her palm. “This set of golems has
been sold for six hundred and twenty cubes! The bidding is complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing at
the window, staring down towards the great hall. He broke out into a
grin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
wouldn’t be around to help him out. Ning would go out adventuring
by himself, and he had spent all of his chaos nectar to buy what he
needed. He had acquired enough from this treasure auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m completely
broke now.” Ning sat down to simply watch. This treasure auction
would no longer mean much to him.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had also
acquired a certain amount of chaos nectar and chaos jewels from the
corpses of the three deceased World-level experts of the Windsource
Realms. As a result, Ning still had roughly fifty cubes worth of
chaos nectar left. However, such a small amount wouldn’t be enough
to purchase any truly powerful items at this auction. It was better
to hold onto them for now. If he ended up being heavily injured, he
could use the chaos nectar to heal himself and save his life! This
wouldn’t pose any burden to him and the healing effect would be
quite quick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only things he
really had to worry about were strange toxins, curse-spells from
major powers, or attacks that caused the truesoul to crumble. It was
hard to use chaos nectar to heal damage inflicted to the truesoul,
but almost all other types of injuries could be healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, there are
only nine treasures left in this treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the ninth day of the
treasure auction, the mood in the hall noticeably grew more
exuberant. The past few treasures had all sold for more than a
thousand cubes or had been listed with such a high reserve price that
over half of them hadn’t been sold. They were simply too expensive!
Only someone truly in desperate need of them would purchase them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first of the
final nine is an Eternal weapon, a greataxe-type weapon. This is a
weapon suitable for Earth-attribute cultivators to use. This weapon
possesses tremendous power and the quintessence core within it is so
strong that we rank this weapon as high-grade.” The silver-eyed
woman produced a small black hatchet in her hands. As it rose into
the air, it quickly expanded in size as it began to emanate waves of
overpowering majesty, causing all of the cultivators in the great
hall to feel a sense of tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an Eternal
weapon, the ‘Three Extinctions Axe’. The reserve price is fifty
thousand cubes. Let the bidding begin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the cultivators
were silent. Even the Daolords on the top floor were silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No bids were placed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that there
was anything wrong with the treasure. It was that it was just too
expensive! It was beyond what the vast majority of World-level
cultivators could afford…and quite frankly, most World-level
cultivators had no need of such a high quality Eternal weapon. They
wouldn’t even be able to unleash much of its power! It was quite
unlikely for a World-level cultivator to be able to unleash the full
force of a high-grade Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, even the most
powerful of World-level cultivators generally preferred to use
low-grade Eternal weapons. Power only mattered if you could actually
command it and wield it! If you couldn’t, what good would it do
you?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second of the
final nine…” The silver-eyed woman didn’t seem surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During each treasure
auction, the final nine treasures would be truly fine specimens that
were worth at least ten thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Thus, there
were rarely any bidders on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, there were
bids on the fifth and sixth treasures, but the bids all came from the
top floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth treasure was
a drop of blood that was the size of a man’s head. It glimmered
with azure light and radiated with an aura of tremendous power. The
silver-eyed woman simply described it as being a drop of
essence-blood from a Chaos Godbeast, giving no further information
about it. In the end, it was purchased by Daolord Waterwind for a
price of 83,000 cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth treasure was
a stone statue. The silver-eyed woman had given even less information
about it: “This stone statue is filled with boundless mysteries.
The reserve price is 80,000 cubes. Let the bidding begin.” In the
end, Daolord Azuresky had purchased it at the reserve price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh treasure…no
bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth
treasure…still no bids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. We have now
come to the final treasure of this treasure auction.” As the
silver-eyed woman’s words came out, the atmosphere in the great
hall began to change. The tension was so palpable and thick, you
could cut it with a knife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of all the
cultivators had lit up. In fact, some were unable to even breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be true…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and Elder God
Wilddog stared unblinkingly at the great hall below. Ning did the
same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be
disappointed.” The silver-eyed woman smiled. “The final treasure
up for sale in this treasure auction…is a single Pseudo Samsara
pill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is a
Pseudo Samsara pill!?” A white-haired woman in a room on the second
floor had an utterly terrifying look in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a wonderful
coincidence. I just acquired a large amount of chaos nectar, and the
very first treasure auction I go to has a Pseudo Samsara pill for
sale. I have to have it.” In another room on the second floor, a
handsome man dressed in fiery red robes had a similarly terrifying
look of lust in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please don’t fight
me over it. Please don’t fight me over it. Gotta have it. Gotta
have it.” A wild-haired youth was muttering these words feverishly
to himself, a look of madness in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Pseudo Samsara
pill.” The silver-eyed woman smiled as she swept the entire great
hall with her gaze. “I imagine all of you know what it does. Let me
remind everyone of the rules pertaining to this pill! Only those who
have reached the level of full mastery as World-level experts can use
Pseudo Samasara pills. This pill shall guide cultivators into finding
their own Dao, letting them break through their bottleneck and become
a Samsara Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! It allows
World Gods to become Samsara Daolords?!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single pill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of
cultivation is an incredibly arduous one. How could a single pill
have such monstrous power?” The cultivators hearing about Pseudo
Samsara pills for the first time, especially the Elder Gods and the
Ancestral Immortals, were utterly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Su Youji, and
Elder God Wilddog sighed in amazement from their room on the third
floor. During the time they spent at the Badlands Court, they had
learned that there was a very small chance that the final item for
sale during each treasure auction would be a Pseudo Samsara pill!
However, this truly was quite rare; less than one in a thousand
treasure auctions would feature a Pseudo Samsara pill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this was
virtually the only chance World-level cultivators would have to
purchase one of the these pills. They were never sold on the ordinary
market. They only ever appeared during the treasure auction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
reasons why so many World-level cultivators from neighboring
territories had hastened here upon hearing that a treasure auction
was going to be held soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When master-class
World-level experts used the Pseudo Samsara pill, they would have a
better than 99% chance of becoming Samsara Daolords. It was all but
guaranteed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So pills like this
really do exist. When I first heard of them, I really couldn’t
believe it,” Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The endless
primordial chaos is filled with endless possibilities.” Su Youji
was uncharacteristically quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a pill that
would drive any World God mad with lust,” Elder God Wilddog
muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Daolords on
the top floor, they were actually sighing in a rather disappointed
way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pseudo Samsara
pills. I wonder what that Eternal Emperor was even thinking? To be
skilled in the Dao of Alchemy is one thing, but why does he have to
spend so much of his time making these Pseudo Samsara pills?”
Azuresky shook his head and chuckled. “Pseudo Samsara pills are
ruinous things. If you rely on one to become a Samsara Daolord, it is
almost guaranteed that you will forever be stuck at the first step.
Even if you have absolutely incredible luck, you would at most reach
the second step. That will be a hard limit. Samsara Daolords move
between life and death with each step. Weak Daolords like them will
never have a chance of improving ever again. If they keep their head
down, nothing bad will happen to them, but if they get too uppity…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second step?
I’ve never personally encountered anyone who used a Pseudo Samsara
pill who could reach the second step.” Waterwind shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at the two of
you go.” Daolord Badlands laughed. “Yes, you feel disdain towards
those pills, but the vast majority of World-level experts never stood
a chance of becoming Samsara Daolords to begin with. They don’t
care how far they can progress after becoming Samsara Daolords; just
becoming a Samsara Daolord is enough to satisfy them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed auction
mistress continued, “Let me warn everyone once more of the Pseudo
Samsara pill’s flaw. If you rely on it to become a Samsara Daolord,
it’ll be very, very hard for you to make any further improvements
afterwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flaw?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who cared? Without it,
most of them would never even be able to reach the Samsara Daolord to
begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reserve price is
a hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Let the bidding begin!”
The silver-eyed woman announced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred thousand
cubes!” Instantly, a hoarse voice rang out from a room on the
second floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred and ten
thousand cubes!” An icy voice rang out from another nearby room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…no…” The
gray-robed, triangle-pupiled old man in the first room had a look of
resentment and grief in his eyes. He didn’t have that much chaos
nectar, just a hundred thousand cubes. He had gone to all of the
treasure auctions in the surrounding territories after amassing this
fortune, and on this trip, his third, he encountered a Pseudo Samsara
pill. He made a bid at the reserve price, hoping no one would fight
him for it, but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone who wanted a
Pseudo Samsara pill knew exactly how much it was worth. Thus,
whenever a treasure auction was being held, all the interested
experts from the dozens of nearby territories would all hasten to the
auction location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
true reasons why treasure auctions were publicly announced
ninety-nine years in advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price continued to
rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred and fifty
thousand cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time one of these
pills appeared, the price would be driven to a staggering level. Most
Eternal weapons were worth just ten thousand cubes, while
high-quality ones might be worth thirty or forty thousand cubes.
Top-grade ones would generally go for around a hundred thousand
cubes, and there were indeed some extremely powerful World-level
experts who were capable of purcashing one or two of them. However,
many of them saved their money instead…all for the sake of being
able to afford a Pseudo Samsara pill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. Only someone who had been driven to despair would go so
berserk over a pill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had an Eternal weapon, but it was merely a low-grade one that was
worth twenty thousand cubes. He had no chance of getting a Pseudo
Samsara pill at all, as they would usually go for more than 160,000
cubes during the treasure auctions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“168,000 cubes. Any
higher bids?” The silver-eyed woman spoke out. “Then…the
bidding for the Pseudo Samsara pill…is over!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her final words came
out very slowly as she scanned the crowd for any more bids. This was
the only treasure which they didn’t take out to physically show the
cultivators present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahahah! It’s
mine! MINE! Ahahahahah!” Frenzied laughter rang out from the second
floor. The bidders for the pseudo Samsara Pill had all been located
on the second floor, choosing to hide their identities from the
masses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally have it.”
The handsome, fiery-robed man had a look of excitement in his eyes.
“I’ll train to become a Samsara Daolord right here in Waveshift
City. I have ten thousand cubes of chaos nectar left. I can even buy
a weak Eternal weapon for myself to use!”

Chapter 20 - [Quintessence Sword-Intent] - The First Stance
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure auction
had come to an end!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having
experienced that great battle against God Emperor Blacklotus, Ji Ning
had felt as though he now knew something of how the world worked…but
now, he realized how truly vast the universe really was. There were
many terrifying World-level experts skilled in formations or
bugbeasts who could easily destroy him, to say nothing of Samsara
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s follow the
plan.” Ning led Su Youji and Elder God Wilddog to move towards the
other disciples of the Badlands Court. They jested and chatted
amongst themselves as they headed back to the Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azuresky, Dracogod,
Thousand Shadows, and Waterwind all began to depart as well. Azuresky
and Thousand Shadows soared into the skies and left, while Dracogod
was forced to use his legs to physically walk out of Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daolord
Dracogod glanced coldly at Waterwind and Thousand Shadows as they
soared into the skies. Thousand Shadows didn’t actually have the
power to fly on this everworld by herself; it was Waterwind who was
helping her do this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousand
Shadows…that bitch. Hmph. All she can do is flatter and cozen up to
Waterwind and the others. When the chance comes, I’ll slaughter you
myself.” Daolord Dracogod then quickly hid the killing intent that
had appeared in his eyes. He had given himself the name ‘Dracogod’,
and getting a ‘dragonification fruit’ was an incredibly important
part of his cultivation path. Alas, it had been seized by Daolord
Thousand Shadows all those years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had many friends,
true. But Daolord Thousand Shadows also had many friends of her own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dracogod deeply
desired to kill Daolord Thousand Shadows. Alas, she was his equal in
strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She ruined my karmic
luck! One day…” Daolord Dracogod strode through the land, quickly
arriving at the spacetime transfer array and departing from the
Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Court.
Within a quiet room inside the Water Curtain Home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavengazer Tower
was located next to a prayer mat. Within the tower there was a golden
leaf, which was itself an estate-world treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. Waves
gently lapped at the beach, caressing the sands before slowly
retreating into the sea once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Ning was
seated on the beach in the lotus position, a blood-colored sword
resting over his knees. He kept Violetjewel with him at all times so
that he could be in constant communion with the sword’s
quintessence core and the exalted sword-intent within it. As a
result, Ning’s sword-arts were beginning to increasingly align with
the core’s murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nameless]
sword-art…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it only had
seven stances, Ning could tell from these seven stances that the
creator of the sword-art had to be at least at the same level as the
creator of Violetjewel. Both were definitely peerless powers who were
skilled in the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-intent of
Violetjewel’s quintessence core was just as exalted as the
sword-intent of the [Nameless] sword-art, even though these were two
completely different interpretations of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll meditate on
both paths.” Ning lowered his head to look at the blood-colored
sword resting across his knees. “In the future, I’ll definitely
become a Samsara Daolord as well. I’ll have to find my own path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nameless]
sword-art’s path wasn’t his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nor was Violetjewel’s
quintessence core’s path his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Daolord
had to find a completely unique path that belonged to them alone. In
the Endless Territories, there were no creatures who had souls or
memories that were absolutely identical. By this same principle, no
two Daolords could ever have exactly the same Daos. Even if both
walked the path of the Dao of the Sword, their paths still would not
be identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Nameless]
sword-art’s strength lies in its balance! Its very first stance,
the ‘Heartsword’ stance, is a testament to this,” Ning mused to
himself. “Although Violetjewel doesn’t have an actual sword-art
connected to it, it does have an exalted sword-intent that I can
meditate on. From this, I can tell that its greatest strength lies in
its offensive attack power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This estate-world was
more than a million kilometers in size. It was a top-grade Chaos
treasure which had originally belonged to Immortal Origination and
was the sturdiest estate-treasure Ning had access to. He usually had
his servants and retainers live within this estate-world, and it even
had many other living beings who flourished within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
meditate on the sword by the beach, occasionally striding across the
waves to stand upon the surface of the ocean as he trained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flew
everywhere with wild abandon, causing the waves around them to be
annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Day by day…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Year by year…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
research into the [Nameless] sword-art and Violetjewel’s
quintessence core. Every so often, he’d take a break and instead
turn to researching the Daos of Water, Lightning, and Space.
Sometimes he’d even go strolling about the world of ordinary
mortals who lived within this treasure. The living beings in this
world were divided up amongst six continents and many islands, and
each continent held an enormous number of individuals. They even had
their own various religions, with the most powerful figures having
just barely reached the Pure Yang True Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hundred years
passed in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop an island in the
sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy, we’re
bored senseless in this estate-world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! Flamefairy,
when will Master lead us out into the outside world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eleven Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were seated in a disorderly fashion, eating and
drinking together. The most prominent figure within their ranks was
Flamefairy Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning generally kept the
Flamefairy and Elder God Wilddog by his side. He had released many
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals from the prisonworld. Some had
chosen to be stationed on the Windsource Chaosworld, while nine of
them had chosen to follow Ning in his adventures. They normally were
stationed here within this estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know?”
Flamefairy Su Youji pointed towards a distant, small island located
far away in the depths of the ocean. “Master is living right there
on that island, but neither I nor Wilddog would dare to go there and
disturb him without being summoned. When Master wants to come to us,
he will. Let’s just keep waiting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No choice but to
wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals truly were quite bored. They all had their own
estate-worlds, and they had already spent countless ages in the
prisonworld diverting themselves by living amongst the mortals of
their own estate-worlds. What they really wanted was action and
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a terrifying
wave of power swept over from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Su Youji,
Elder God Wilddog, and the other nine Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals simultaneously rose to their feet. They turned to stare
towards that distant island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bloody streak of
sword-light soared into the skies, spreading out into a rippling wave
of power that caused all of them to quake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This wave…” Su
Youji was the strongest of the eleven, but even she was so terrified
that her heart quailed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
The more powerful figures who lived on the six continents and many
islands of this estate-world all turned to stare at the same
location! Although they couldn’t see anything physically, they
could sense an utterly exalted and supremely terrifying sword-intent
rising towards the heavens. Although the sword-intent was limited to
this estate-world, all of the living creatures within it felt that it
was something that was truly supreme and beyond all other power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this day, quite a
few new Sword Immortals began to arise from within this estate-world.
In fact, quite a few of its citizens began to sail off into the seas
in search of the source of that sword-intent. Alas, they were never
able to find it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is coming.”
Su Youji and the other ten all stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
striding across the waves, an ordinary-looking blood-colored sword on
his back. He soon arrived at their island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Master.”
Su Youji and the other ten all bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve spent five
hundred years here at the Badlands Court,” Ning said. “My
sword-arts have now reached a bottleneck. It is time for us to go out
adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five hundred years in
the Badlands Court actually translated into more than ten thousand
years within this estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, just now…?”
Su Youji’s eyes were shining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I developed a
sword-stance.” Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, it wasn’t the
Great Firmament stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had long ago reached
a bottleneck in the [Nameless] sword-art. In recent years, Ning had
turned most of his efforts towards understanding the quintessence
core of Violetjewel. Today, he had developed a sword-art that had an
incredibly powerful offensive potential. Ning called it the first
stance of his [Sword Quintessence] - Blackmist stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God
Blackmist…” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would never be able
to forget how he met this man after he had left the Three Realms. He
would never be able to forget the sight of World God Blackmist slowly
transforming into a statue. He had named this stance the ‘Blackmist’
stance in order to memorialize this deceased World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The creation of the
Blackmist stance was the final result of the ten thousand years of
hard work and effort Ning had spent within this estate-world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of killing
power, this stance should be quite close to the power of the ‘Great
Firmament’ stance of the [Nameless] sword-art. Because I based it
off Violetjewel’s quintessence core, it’ll actually make it
easier for me to summon some of the core’s power.” Just now, Ning
had tested that stance out. He was now able to summon more than ten
times as much power from Violetjewel’s quintessence core, and the
power of his strike was definitely comparable to that of a
master-class World God’s strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the
azureflower mist energy strengthening his divine body, his body was
comparable to a World God’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts were
comparable to an elite World God’s techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the ‘Blackmist’
stance activating a good amount of his Eternal weapon’s
quintessence core…Ning was now qualified to battle against
master-class World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be hard for
me to improve my sword-arts any further just by sitting here and
studying on my own. It is time for me to leave this place.” Ning
glanced at Su Youji and the others, then instructed, “Youji,
Wilddog, Blacksun, the three of you shall follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
Flamefairy and Wilddog were quite calm, but Elder God Blacksun was
absolutely overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led the three in
departing from this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had purchased
those three mighty golems during the treasure auction. One was meant
for the Flamefairy while the other was meant for Wilddog. As for the
third, Ning had chosen to let Elder God Blacksun to command it. Elder
God Blacksun was one of the most powerful Elder God retainers Ning
had under his command, and he was also a bit more honest and obedient
than the others. Ning preferred subordinates who were able to follow
orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” They had
returned to the Water Curtain Home inside the Badlands Court. “You
can go and pay some visits to your friends in the Badlands Court. You
can tell them that I am heading out towards the Allgod Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Allgod Estate?”
Su Youji was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ll make
sure the entire Badlands Court knows.” Su Youji laughed
delightedly. She had far more friends here than Ning did, which was
only natural; a woman of such charm and beauty would naturally be
welcomed wherever she went.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also…I’m
planning for us to leave three months from now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji nodded.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three months later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth and
a fat man whose eyes brimmed with flames were striding
shoulder-to-shoulder across the surface of a lake, advancing across
the waves as they departed from the Badlands Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, you
picked something of a bad time.” The pudgy man chatted to Ning as
they continued their journey forwards. “Quite a few people came
back to the Badlands Court to take part in the treasure auction, but
once it ended all of them quickly headed out to go adventuring. If
you had spread the word right after the treasure auction that you had
chosen to head to the Allgod Estate, at least four or five
World-level experts would’ve chosen to go with you. But you instead
chose to wait for more than two hundred years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pudgy man chuckled.
“Most of the people who wanted to go out already have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pudgy man was
quite an amiable fellow, even though he looked rather ugly due to the
jagged scars and tattoos that lined his face. His eyes brimmed with
flames, and his skin was suffused with a faint red color as well.
Even when he was smiling, he still looked quite frightening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still have you,
senior apprentice-brother Dragonbinder.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I purchased a
treasure during the auction and spent a bit of time binding it. I was
just about to head out anyhow. Our timing was perfect,” the pudgy
man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two moved across
the ground, their bodies flickering like illusions as they advanced
nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had waited three
months for word of his journey to spread, but only a single member of
the Badlands Court had chosen to journey with him - the pudgy fellow
next to him, World God Dragonbinder!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They entered the
spacetime transfer array and left the Badlands Everworld. They then
boarded a flying ship, flew for several months, then finally reached
the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod Chaosworld
was an oceanic world. There were two great continents and a vast
ocean that covered everything else. One continent held countless
living beings while the other held the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cloud was floating
through the skies. Ning and the pudgy man were standing atop the
cloud, staring down at the vast world before them. They could vaguely
make out the outlines of a towering edifice far off in the distance.
That distant sight was enough to cause both Ning and World God
Dragonbinder to feel breathless, as though they were staring upwards
at something supreme.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Allgod Estate!”
The pudgy man’s eyes blazed with fire as he stared at the great
edifice. He said in a low voice, “Brother Ji Ning, we’ve been
fairly relaxed on the way over. Now that we are about enter the
Allgod Estate, though…I want to make a few things clear to you!
Once we go in, we need to do exactly as we discussed. You can’t act
rashly! If you do, then I’ll have to part ways with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acting rashly in a
place like this is suicide. Don’t worry, senior apprentice-brother
Dragonbinder,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The pudgy
man nodded. In truth, he felt certain that Ning wouldn’t be so
foolish. At the same time, he knew that unexpected things would
sometimes happen! As a member of the Badlands Court, he was naturally
quite a talented figure. He hadn’t trained for very long, but he
had already become a master-class World God. If he was to lose his
life due to an act of foolishness on the part of Ji Ning, how
lamentable that would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Allgod Estate
was created by Daolord Allgod,” the pudgy man said. “Daolord
Allgod was an incredibly powerful Daolord. Although he failed his
Daomerge, based on what I’ve learned I believe that he was a
thousand times more powerful than other Daolords who were on the
Verge of the Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That much more
powerful?” Ning was shocked. A thousand times?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was insane!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky himself
had admitted that he was vastly inferior to Daolord Allgod. However,
Ning didn’t understand exactly how much more powerful Daolord
Allgod had been. Even now, he could hardly believe what World God
Dragonbinder was telling him. The difference in power was simply too
great! If this was true, then it meant that Daolord Allgod had the
power to easily slay other Daolords who were at the Verge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not
exaggerating. Although he failed his Daomerge, he once attacked and
chased after an Eternal Emperor who had successfully completed his
Daomerge. He pursued the man for multiple chaos cycles, and to this
very day no one knows what happened to that Eternal Emperor.” The
pudgy man looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was really that
powerful?!” Ning felt rather stunned. He only spent a brief period
of time by Daolord Solesky’s side and had spent most of his time at
the Badlands Court in seclusion. Thus, he knew very little
information regarding these mysterious, powerful figures. However,
World God Dragonbinder was a true disciple of the Badlands Court who
often conversed with his fellow cultivators. He knew quite a bit of
‘secret’ information.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true. I once
discussed this with our eldest disciple at the Court.” World God
Dragonbinder let out a sigh. “And…you should know that Daolords
generally are afraid to try to enter the Allgod Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod Estate was
an extremely strange place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">30% of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were able to survive it, 50% of World-level
experts were able to survive it, but…of the Daolords who dared to
enter it, less than 10% would be able to emerge! This was an
incredibly high casualty rate, making it so that not many Daolords
dared to even attempt it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was simply way
too powerful!” World God Dragonbinder looked at Ning and smiled.
“Although he’s a bit ruthless towards other Daolords, he’s
quite benevolent towards World-level experts, Elder Gods, and
Ancestral Immortals. He left behind more than ten thousand treasuries
at the ‘Ten Thousand Mountains’ alone! Come, it is time for us to
enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the two
simultaneously charged downwards, they suddenly encountered a region
of twisted space. Moments later, both of them vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense space
twisting around him. Moments later, he reappeared in the air with
World God Dragonbinder next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How beautiful.”
Ning saw a long, winding series of majestic mountains located in
front of him. The mountains were all interconnected and seemed to
form a long, sinuous coiling dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ten Thousand
Mountains of the Allgod Estate,” World God Dragonbinder said
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
stared at them from afar as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were countless
mountains before them. At the end of the mountains there was a region
of endless mist…and beyond the ‘endless’ mist there was an
utterly dazzling, eye-catching estate of vast proportions. This
estate was simply too vast. Even though they were very far away, they
could still make out its details quite clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense it…”
Ning could sense the Mirrorsnow Painting within his Jindan region was
calling out joyfully, having sensed a faint resonance nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be up
ahead. According to what big brother Solesky said, it should be
within the center of the Fog Sea.” Ning stared at the endless Fog
Sea located past the great mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outermost layer of
the Allgod Estate consisted of the Ten Thousand Mountains. There were
exactly ten thousand mountains in this region!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second layer was
the Fog Sea!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core region was the
actual, towering edifice known as the Castrum Divinitus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
World God Dragonbinder looked at Ning. “Let’s try out the Ten
Thousand Mountains first. After that, I’ll go to the Fog Sea by
myself. You shouldn’t go there; it is far too dangerous a place for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had come here mainly
because he wanted to acquire the Mirrorsnow Painting. Since the
painting was located within the Fog Sea, he naturally had to enter
it! However, he knew that World God Dragonbinder was looking out for
his best interests. According to what the vast majority of
cultivators had experienced, although Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals had a good chance of surviving the mountain region, they
would almost certainly die upon entering the Fog Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, World-level
experts stood a very good chance of surviving the Fog Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” World
God Dragonbinder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flew through
the air towards the nearest mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what past
cultivators had discovered, there were two fairly safe paths that
could be followed through the Ten Thousand Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the two landed
atop the mountain, they began to advance through its forests. Watery
waves spread out in constant ripples around them as they kept a close
eye on their surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They travelled through
one mountain after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They travelled
cautiously and didn’t move too quickly. More than ten days passed
in the blink of an eye, and they saw a number of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals on their journey. However, all of them were so
frightened upon seeing Ning and Dragonbinder that they immediately
fled. Naturally, the two of them paid these minor figures no heed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, did you
know? Every single mountain here holds the grave of a World-level
expert,” World God Dragonbinder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard.”
Ning nodded. “According to the stories, after Daolord Allgod failed
his Daomerge he began to wander through the Endless Territories as he
searched for cultivators who had committed many grave sins. More than
ten thousand World-level experts died by his hand! Every single
mountain is the rest spot for at least one of those evil cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My guess is that
Daolord Allgod wanted to kill as many sinners as he could to
accumulate more karmic virtue, hoping that he might be able to find a
way to survive.” World God Dragonbinder sighed. “But once you
fail your Daomerge, your death becomes an inevitability. Many
powerful experts have tried using various methods to stay alive…but
alas, all of those efforts came to naught.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
walk while chatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and World God
Dragonbinder both came to a halt. They raised their head to stare off
into the distance. The forest here was blocking their vision, but
they were able to see a half-opened door that was covered with some
divine runes and inscriptions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the
treasury?” Ning and Dragonbinder exchanged a curious glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single mountain
of the Ten Thousand Mountains held the corpse of a sinful cultivator
as well as a treasury! This meant that there were ten thousand
treasuries here…but the treasuries were tightly guarded and not
easily accessed. This mountain, however, had a great gateway carved
into it, and the runes covering the gateway were even more profound
than the ones used to forge Dao weapons. Clearly, this had to be a
treasury!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in and
take a look,” Dragonbinder sent mentally. “We’ve found the
treasury, but we won’t necessarily be able to take it with us.
Plus, the ‘real’ treasury might be inside there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s
go.” Ning carefully scrutinized the great door as well.”

Chapter 22 - Treasury
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great door was
sixty meters tall and completely black. It was covered with complex
silver runes that emanated ripples of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and World God
Dragonbinder moved to stand directly in front of the great door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my first
trip to the Allgod Estate.” World God Dragonbinder let out a sigh.
“Just by looking at this door, I can tell that the legends of
Daolord Allgod were probably all true! How could a mere door be this
complex and profound? This is just one of ten thousand treasures
located within these mountains, and yet its restrictive spells are
incredibly complex.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” World God
Dragonbinder nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two advanced
together into the deep, dark hallway past the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced backwards.
As expected, the great door had already closed behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
information Ning had previously purchased, there were ten thousand
mountains here and every single mountain had a treasury within it. If
anyone passed through a treasury door, the door would temporarily
swing shut behind them so as to bar any other cultivators from
entering! If Ning and World God Dragonbinder failed in acquiring the
treasures located in the treasury, the door would swing open and
release the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they successfully
acquired the treasures, then the entire treasury region would crumble
apart and reveal a different hallway that would grant them safe
departure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is light up
ahead.” Ning sped up just slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There shouldn’t be
any traps.” World God Dragonbinder was quite excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two quickly reached
the end of this first hallway. Before them was a spacious region that
was roughly thirty kilometers in size and filled with a layer of
blurry light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the treasury
region.” World God Dragonbinder revealed a look of excitement.
“This treasury region is still intact. That means it still holds
its treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures are
hard to win. Less than one in ten thousand cultivators will succeed
in their attempts.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. Although the
trials were quite difficult, so long as the door remained open and a
steady stream of cultivators continued to enter this place, sooner or
later there would be a successful trial-taker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and World God
Dragonbinder entered the treasury region of blurry light. Both of
them grew more cautious as they did so, because this place had
restrictive spells which had been emplaced by Daolord Allgod. Once
those spells were triggered, even Daolords might perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A corpse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the very
center of the treasury region. A stone coffin was located there, and
a corpse could be made out inside of it. Above the stone coffin
hovered a globe of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to their
intelligence reports, both Ning and Dragonbinder knew that the light
globes were where the treasures were stored! The ten thousand
treasures in the mountains were all different. Some had a single
powerful treasure, such as an Eternal weapon, while others had eight
or nine different Dao weapons. Some even had extremely formidable
techniques, forbidden arts, divine abilities, or special legacies…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, everything
was possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You try first,
senior apprentice-brother Dragonbinder,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, I’ll try
first.” Dragonbinder nodded as he strode forward. When he reached a
distance of three hundred meters from the stone coffin, the globe of
light expanded in size to instantly become more than three hundred
meters large!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything within that
region transformed into a blur. Ning could no longer see World God
Dragonbinder at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
treasury this is.” Ning waited quietly to one side. The reason he
let World God Dragonbinder make the first attempt was because
Dragonbinder was quite powerful! Even if Ning unleashed all of his
power, he still would probably be forced to flee in the face of
Dragonbinder’s power. Dragonbinder was a true master-class World
God, after all, and he had some special treasures of his own. He was
definitely a match for the Starlord of Fogstone and arguably even a
bit more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A period of time
passed, enough to boil a kettle of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” World God
Dragonbinder emerged from that region of blurred space. The blurred
space quickly shrank in size as the light was retracted back into the
globe of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” World God
Dragonbinder shook his head. “That was ridiculously hard. Way too
hard! Even if I spent another chaos cycle training for it, I still
wouldn’t have any chance of taking over this treasury.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was the trial?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single treasury
had its own trials as set down by Daolord Allgod. You would only gain
the contents of the treasury if you succeeded in passing the trial.
Everyone had to follow the rules of the game which Daolord Allgod had
set down! Perhaps some ancient powers who had become Eternal Emperors
might be able to forcibly plunder a few treasures, but those figures
generally disdained from acting in such a manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Daolord
Allgod’s fame was so great that even many of those Eternal powers
were afraid of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It pertained to the
mysteries of the Dao of Fire.” World God Dragonbinder explained,
“Although I’m quite talented in Fire and in Water, I’m not even
close to being able to solve this trial.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fire?” Ning just
stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had some
insights into Fire, he was still quite weak in this regard. He hadn’t
even mastered the Heavenly Dao of Fire! To pass Daolord Allgod’s
trial was quite unlikely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Daolord Allgod
gave trials to Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals which were easier
than the trials he gave to World-level experts, Ning clearly wouldn’t
be able to succeed in this particular trial. If it was a trial over
the Dao of the Sword, Ning would’ve given it a shot, but Fire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m very weak in
the Dao of Fire.” Ning shook his head. “I’ll let one of my
retainers give it a shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Youji?” World
God Dragonbinder grinned. It had been Flamefairy Su Youji who had
informed the others that Ji Ning was heading to the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded,
then willed her to emerge. Whoosh. An incomparably beautiful woman
dressed in fiery robes appeared by his side. It was Su Youji, the
Flamefairy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
revealed a smile, then glanced at World God Dragonbinder. She said in
a rather unhappy manner, “Senior Dragonbinder, you accompanied my
master to this place but refused to let come out as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because we
wanted to wait until we could give you something nice, such as right
now.” World God Dragonbinder grinned at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something nice?”
Su Youji was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” Ning
pointed at the distant light globe which hovered above that stone
coffin. “We are in one of the treasury regions of the Ten Thousand
Mountains of the Allgod Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasury? I heard
that Daolord Allgod left behind ten thousand treasuries.” Su Youji
looked at the globe of light, a heated look in her eyes. She then
glanced at Ning. “Master, you let me out because…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Dragonbinder gave it a shot but failed. The trials
of this treasury pertain to the Dao of Fire,” Ning explained. “You
are quite skilled in the Dao of Fire. You can be considered one of
the most elite Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals in this regard, and
you are very close to becoming a World-level expert yourself. You
might have a chance at passing this trial.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji began to grow
rather excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had heard others
speak of this place before…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single trial in
the Allgod Estate was incredibly difficult for World-level experts,
but they were generally a bit easier for Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals. However, the trials were all different in nature. A Trial
of Fire would test everyone in the Dao of Fire, whereas a Trial of
Lightning would test everyone in the Dao of Lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I give it a
try?” Su Youji looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji eagerly and
nervously walked forward towards the stone coffin. Once she reached
three hundred meters of it, the globe of light once more expanded to
completely encompass her within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, do you
think Youji will be able to acquire the treasures?” World God
Dragonbinder asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She should have at
least a 20% to 30% chance,” Ning posited. After Daolord Solesky had
given Su Youji some guidance, she had improved quite dramatically.
She was just a hair away from becoming a World-level expert and could
break through at any moment. Given how talented she was in the Dao of
Fire, it was likely that she stood a very good chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
one minute at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s been inside
for longer than me,” World God Dragonbinder said expectantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
He was rather excited as well. It would be wonderful if the
treasury’s contents ended up in one of their hands. If the
treasures Su Youji acquired were of limited use to her but of
tremendous use to World God Dragonbinder, she could trade them to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Flamefairy
suddenly emerged from that blurry region. The field of light quickly
retracted and returned to the globe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I failed.” Su
Youji looked at Ning, a hint of disappointment and helplessness in
her eyes. “I was so close! Just a bit more and I would’ve
succeeded. If I had just slightly deeper insights into the Dao of
Fire, I would’ve succeeded. Unfortunately, when that happens I’ll
probably reach the World level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord’s
trials must include a different component as well,” World God
Dragonbinder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Perhaps. Based
on the records I read, less than one in ten thousand cultivators will
succeed in passing one of these trials. Most likely, you have to have
certain special insights into the Dao of Fire in order to succeed.”
Su Youji nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well.
“Now you two have gotten me interested. I want to give it a shot as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, Master? But
your Dao of Fire…?” Su Youji looked at Ning. She had followed
Ning for some time now and knew him to be very weak in the Dao of
Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can at least give
it a try, right?” Ning also knew that he was quite weak in the Dao
of Fire, but he had never tried one of these trials before. He wanted
to at least experience it for himself. It was quite safe; no one had
ever lost their lives in the treasuries before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped into the
range of the stone coffin as well. That globe of light emitted a
large wave of light and quickly encompassed a region of three hundred
meters with it.
</P>

Chapter 23 - The Treasury’s Trial
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was transported
into the blurry region of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
in surprise. In front of him were a series of walls of light that
protected the light globe above the coffin. There were nine walls of
light in total, and each of them were covered with flowing, fiery-red
runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pass through all
nine restrictive spells and you shall acquire the treasure.” A
booming voice rang out by Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where did that voice
come from? Was it the voice of Daolord Allgod, or was it the voice of
a treasure spirit?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who cares.” It
didn’t really matter. All Ning needed to know was that he had to be
on his best behavior in a place which had been established by a
Daolord of such incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pass through all
nine restrictive spells? How?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
first light barrier and the fiery red runes flowing atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t seem that
hard.” Ning quickly came to understand how the barrier worked. He
pressed his palm onto the light barrier, filling it with his Immortal
energy. Because Ning had already comprehended its mysteries, he was
easily able to master it and take control over it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disperse.” Ning
willed the light barrier to disperse. Whoosh. The first light barrier
completely vanished, leaving eight more behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more advanced
forward. The second barrier was also one covered by divine runes
pertaining to the Dao of Fire, but they were clearly much more
complicated. Ning just stood there, blinking several times as he
stared at those runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had no idea the
difference between me and Su Youji was this huge,” Ning mumbled to
himself. He was both an Elder God and an Ancestral Immortal, and so
he was given the exact same trial as the one Su Youji had been given.
She had said that she was ‘very close’ to succeeding, which meant
that she had probably made it to the final light barrier and was very
close to solving it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…can’t even
understand the runes on this eighth barrier.” Ning shook his head.
“I really am weak in the Dao of Fire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite this setback,
Ning wasn’t too disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivation was a path
filled with choices! If you chose to focus your efforts in areas you
were skilled in, you would be able to advance much more quickly and
even find it easier to break through certain bottlenecks. Ning was
best suited to the Dao of the Sword. Even Lu Dongbin and Patriarch
Subhuti had seen this in him all those years ago. Although Ning had
made fairly quick breakthroughs in heartforce as well, heartforce
remained a matter of the heart. Even after experiencing the great war
that had shaken the Three Realms, Ning’s heartforce was merely at
the fourth stage. His Dao of the Sword, however, had advanced quite
rapidly. He was now just one step away from sixth-stage swordforce,
the ‘Sword World’ level. He had even invented a first stance for
his [Quintessence Sword-Intent], the ‘Blackmist’ stance, and this
stance was nearly as powerful as the third stance of the [Nameless]
sword-art, the ‘Great Firmament’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
technique was so great that it was superior to some weaker Sword
Worlds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Sword Immortals
trained in the Dao of the Sword, but no two Sword Worlds were the
same. Some were dominating, others were insidious. Even two
cultivators who trained in the exact same technique would end up with
their own different insights into it. As for the ‘Great Firmament’
stance, it would result in one of the most powerful types of Sword
World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the Sword
is my true Dao. Fire?” Ning shook his head and laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Ning’s
face suddenly went blank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That voice said that
I had to ‘pass through all nine restrictive spells’.” Ning
glanced at the eight light barriers remaining. “It just said ‘pass
through’. It didn’t say how I had to pass through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I bind and take
control over the restrictive spells, I can disperse them and pass
through them.” A strange light flickered in Ning’s eyes. “But…if
I forcibly break through them, I would also be able to pass through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two ways of
dealing with any formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first method was to
understand the formation and then break it down on a technical level.
This was what Ning had done with the initial light barrier, and it
was the most common solution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second method was
just to overpower it with raw force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It didn’t matter how
profound a formation was if an enemy could rip it apart using raw,
overwhelming power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would I be able to
breach a formation left behind by Daolord Allgod?” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pondered for a
moment, then he bowed respectfully and called out, “Revered
Daolord, this junior is not capable of passing through these nine
barriers through mastering and dispersing them. However, this junior
would like to be so bold as to attempt breaking through using raw
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Ning
turned his gaze towards the eight light barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
thrust out his palm, forming a streak of light at the tip of his
fingers. The streak of light had the vague form of a sword, and it
was filled with Ning’s azureflower mist energy. Ning even activated
the Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand] in his two hands, making
his fingers comparable to Dao weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning struck out, the
second barrier of light trembled then shattered apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It broke?” Ning
was overjoyed. However, he wasn’t in a hurry to press the attack,
instead pausing for a brief moment to see if there were any
repercussions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nothing happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
using raw power to break through the formation isn’t considered a
violation of the Daolord’s decree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me continue.”
Ning took another step forward, his right hand quickly executing the
savage ‘Blood Drop’ stance as he sent it stabbing towards a light
barrier. Whoosh! It struck out like a sharp sword, stabbing into the
light barrier. The light barrier trembled twice, then shattered
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His power was nothing
to joke about. With the azureflower mist energy reinforcing him, he
was every bit as strong as a World God! The power of this blow was as
strong as a blow from an actual World God…but of course, this was
merely the seventh barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still wonder where
this ‘azureflower region’ formed by the merging of the Nine Chaos
Seals came from.” Ning felt increasingly amazed by how unearthly
powerful this technique was. Without it, he would at most have the
body of a half-step World God. Even with Violetjewel, he would be
just barely comparable to a normal World God at best. He wouldn’t
even be a match for an elite World God! Now that the azureflower mist
energy was reinforcing his body, he was definitely as physically
strong as a World God. With Violetjewel in hand, he was able to give
master-class World Gods a run for their money.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how
powerful I will be when I become a World God.” Ning fantasized
about it for a moment, then returned to the matter at hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to continue.”
Ning once more struck out, attacking the sixth barrier. However, this
one was clearly much harder to penetrate. Ning wasn’t able to
breach it with his first strike and needed to hack at it multiple
times before succeeding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll use my sword,
I guess.” Ning waved his hand, producing Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” He stabbed
out with his sword, activating a hint of its quintessence core as he
did so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword easily
stabbed straight into that barrier of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forward
one step at a time. With Violetjewel in hand, his strikes were now
much more powerful. This was a formation meant to test Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals. Ning naturally found it quite easy to penetrate.
Even without using the Blackmist stance, he was still able to breach
the seven of the nine barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighth barrier?”
Ning once more stabbed out with his sword. This time, however, he
failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
solemnly held Violetjewel in his hands…then suddenly lashed out,
transforming it into a bloody shadow of sword-light. Violetjewel left
a streak of terrifying, bloody red light in its wake as it pierced
forward. This was the power of its quintessence core! Violetjewel
itself was covered in bloody light that radiated an aura of
astonishing might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Quintessence
Sword-Intent], first stance - Blackmist stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bloody sword-light
stabbed straight through the eighth barrier, causing it to crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one left.”
Ning didn’t hesitate at all, once more striking out with his
ultimate attack. The azureflower mist energy made Ning’s sword far
faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos, while the quintessence
core of the sword made this Eternal weapon irresistibly sharp! It was
very sharp, very powerful, and incomparably fast. This blow would’ve
been able to easily shatter a chaosworld apart. Even if the Solar
Star or the Lunar Star were in front of Ning, they would have been
pierced through by this blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the tip of the
sword slammed against the ninth barrier, the barrier began to tremble
violently. Ripples shuddered over its surface as though a rock had
fallen into a pool of water…and yet, it did not break.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still a bit
too weak?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His blows were now
incredibly powerful thanks to his own great strength and the fact
that he had an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you to
break!” Ning once more struck out with his most powerful killing
blow. Although the ninth barrier shuddered violently, it was clear
that Ning’s blows were just a bit too weak to break it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning
frowned. This was already the most powerful sword-strike he was
capable of mustering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess I’ll have
to find a way to strengthen the power of that blow.” Ning
immediately stepped back, moving to stand just within the three
hundred meter radius of the blurry light region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A pair of azure
wings appeared behind Ning’s back, crackling with electric light.
These were the ‘Thunderlight Wings’ which Ning had purchased
during the treasure auction. The wings used lightning as their energy
source and sword-light to tear through all obstructions, allowing the
user to move at incredible speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wings trembled,
instantly sending Ning hurtling through the torn layers of space and
allowing him to move at tremendous speed as he moved towards the
ninth light barrier like a streak of light himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators needed a
bit of distance to build up speed as well. Long-distance flying speed
and short-distance dodging speed were two completely different
things. It was extremely difficult for one to instantly unleash all
of his power and speed! Three hundred meters simply wasn’t enough.
Ning had to use the Thunderlight Wings to build up enough speed to
surpass the limits of the Heavenly Daos. Without it, Ning would
perhaps only be able to move at 60% of his normal speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” As Ning
charged out, he once more struck forward with his Eternal weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword’s attack
speed was extremely important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a pebble that
moved at the speed of light could cause tremendous damage. By the
same principle, a sword that moved 30% faster than it previously did
could easily cause more than double the amount of damage! If Ning
just struck out from point-blank distance, there was no way for him
to increase the speed of his sword. Thus, he was forced to resort to
the most primitive of options…fly forward at high speed and borrow
from his own speed to deliver a full-force blow. This instantly
allowed his sword to move 20% or 30% faster than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!! Ning’s
terrifyingly sharp Eternal weapon struck out like a bloody blur.
Although it paused momentarily, in the end it still pierced straight
through the light barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!! The final
light barrier disintegrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The light globe above
the stone coffin was now within arm’s reach!

Chapter 24 - Formation Spirit
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked at the
globe of light hovering above the coffin. He couldn’t help but feel
slightly excited; this was a treasury left behind by Daolord Allgod,
after all! He really was quite lucky to have encountered a treasury
so soon after entering the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning reached
out with his hand, touching the light globe with his fingers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed. He sent his fingers through the light globe two more times,
completely confused. “Nothing? There’s nothing inside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his fingers
touched the light globe, they went straight through the globe as
though the globe didn’t even exist. There really was nothing
inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a beam of
light descended out of nowhere, materializing next to the stone
coffin into the shape a white-robed old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was quite
surprised, he was able to keep calm. This was because he knew exactly
how powerful the restrictive spells Daolord Allgod had left behind.
It was capable of easily slaying most Daolords; if the formation
wanted him dead, he had no chance of fighting back at all! However,
countless cultivators throughout countless chaos cycles had ventured
through these treasuries. There was no danger here whatsoever! No one
had ever lost their lives while trying to gain a treasure from within
a treasury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Elder God?” The
white-robed elder glanced at Ning. The old man emanated an aura of
natural majesty and prestige, but he chuckled softly as he looked at
Ning. “Can you tell me your name?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Ning
looked at the elder. “Who are you, senior?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation-spirit
of the Ten Thousand Mountains. My master once gave me a name, ‘Myriad
Mountains’,” the old man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation-spirit?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite normal for
treasures to give birth to treasure-spirits. However, it was
incredibly rare for powerful formations to gain sentience as well.
For example, the ancient spacetime transfer arrays that were spread
throughout the various territories of the primordial chaos had
existed for countless chaos cycles, but Ning had never heard of any
of them gaining sentience. Similarly, although some incredibly
powerful formations would appear during various treasure auctions,
Ning had never heard of any of them possessing sentience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it really that
surprising? Master lay down three formations in total: the Ten
Thousand Mountains Formation, the Fog Sea Formation, and the Castrum
Divinitus Formation. He infused all three with his most profound
insights into formations, and all three of us gained sentience.”
The old man looked at Ning. “Someone on your level cannot possibly
even imagine how truly powerful Master was. You might’ve met some
Samsara Daolords in the past, but don’t even try to judge Master by
their yardstick. They aren’t worthy! Only a Samsara Daolord who has
pursued an Eternal Emperor after sending them fleeing can be
discussed in the same breath as my master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although countless
years had passed, the spirit of this formation was still filled with
the utmost of pride in his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you boasted while
having nothing to back it up, others would mock you. However, Daolord
Allgod was so powerful that even Daolord Solesky was in awe of him
and admitted inferiority before his prowess. Even Daolord Badlands
would sigh in awe when discussing Daolord Allgod with his
subordinates and juniors. Clearly, Daolord Allgod had been so
awe-inspiring a figure in life that even now, after having died
countless ages ago, his fame continued to resonate with later
generations of cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for me to wax on any longer regarding how almighty Master was. Once
you become a Daolord, you’ll understand,” the white-robed elder
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? A Daolord?”
Ning laughed. “Why do you have such confidence in me, senior?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You clearly are just
an Elder God, but you are capable of unleashing the power of a
master-class World God.” The formation-spirit sighed. “It would
be very easy for you to kill weak World Gods. An Elder God capable of
easily killing most World Gods! There are very, very few monsters
such as you. Many people will have a chance to encounter a Samsara
Daolord in their lifetimes, but meeting a monster like you is
incredibly rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monsters like you
generally are blessed with tremendous luck. Based on what I know,
roughly 80% of people like you end up becoming Samsara Daolords,”
the formation-spirit said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Eighty percent?”
Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
there was a belief in ‘karmic luck’. Luck was an ephemeral,
fleeting thing. No cultivator had ‘fixed’ luck, as luck could
often change. For example, you might be born into an incredibly good
family with your parents both being powerful Immortals or Fiendgods.
Someone born into a situation like this could be said to be born into
a tremendously lucky situation. However, if this person ended up
becoming a silkpants wastrel who didn’t work hard in cultivation,
his karmic luck would begin to decline.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, for example.
He was reincarnated into a decent family and with the Nuwa Painting,
and so it could be said that he was born with fairly decent luck.
After he gained the legacy of Daoist Threelives, his karmic luck
became even better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single person had
to fight for their own karmic luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the karmic
luck of the Three Realms was quite weak compared to the overwhelming
power of the primordial chaos. Ning was now fighting to gain the
karmic luck of the Endless Territories! There were some World-level
cultivators who would massacre the living creatures of many
chaosworlds, causing great sin to accrue upon them. Daolord Allgod
had once chased after and slaughtered countless great sinners,
resulting in more and more karmic luck and karmic blessings being
bestowed upon him. Karmic virtue and karmic sin existed in the
Endless Territories…and so too did karmic luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three Realms,
three people gained the Nine Chaos Seals - Nuwa, Ji Ning, and Daoist
Three Purities. All of them gained tremendous karmic luck as a
result. If it wasn’t for the Nine Chaos Seals, Ning wouldn’t be
able to easily slay weak World Gods as a mere Elder God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, on the path
of cultivation, either you advance forward or you slowly fall
behind.” The formation-spirit looked at Ning. “My master was even
more monstrously talented than you are. Alas, he still failed in his
Daomerge. He died and his Dao faded away. Remember to treasure every
single scrap of karmic luck you come across.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
words of wisdom.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, all of the
treasuries here in the Ten Thousand Mountains are empty.” The
elderly formation-spirit looked at Ning. “I decide what treasures
are to be awarded to those who pass the trials. Master left me with
many treasures and decreed that I can teleport any of them into the
globe of light. He certainly didn’t want to be bothered with such
minor matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this treasury, I
had originally intended the light globe to be filled with an idol of
fire that was filled with the mysteries of the Dao of Fire.” As the
elderly formation-spirit spoke, he waved his hand and produced a
palm-sized fiery idol. This idol had eight faces, some beautiful,
some ugly, some stern. The idol was covered with countless mysterious
runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single Elder
God who wishes to try and break the treasury formations here in the
Ten Thousand Islands has to have at least the power of a master-class
World God. If they do, then they can succeed.” The elderly
formation-spirit looked at Ning. “Every single monstrously talented
figure such as yourself is qualified to receive a treasure…but of
course, you have to find a treasury first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, each person
will only have one such opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On your very first
trip here, you defeated a barrier spell through raw power. As a
result, the seeds of good karma have been sown between us! However,
you’ll find that you will no longer be able to break through any of
the other barrier spells using raw power,” the elderly
formation-spirit said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
said in surprise, “But senior, you spoke of ‘sowing the seeds of
good karma’. Although I feel confident in my powers, you are the
formation-spirit of the Ten Thousand Mountains. Can it be that there
is something you wish Darknorth to do, senior?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elderly
formation-spirit said, “There is indeed one thing. However, I won’t
force you to do it; I merely hope that you can help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please let me know
what you wish me to do, senior.” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master had a
hated foe.” A savage light flickered through the elderly
formation-spirit’s eyes, and a murderous aura permeated his voice.
“Master pursued his foe for many years, spending enormous amounts
of effort in his attempt to kill him. Alas, in the end he wasn’t
able to do so. His foe ended up fleeing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
“Senior, are you speaking of that Eternal Emperor he pursued?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The Eternal
Emperor.” The formation-spirit explained, “His name was Emperor
Melobo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Melobo?”
Ning tasted the name. The name felt foreign, alien.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
Badlands told me, Emperor Melobo has already returned.” The elderly
formation-spirit laughed coldly. “My master chased him all the way
into the endless darkness, where he hid himself from my master’s
sight. He must have returned only after learning that my master
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
surprised that Daolord Badlands was apparently acquainted with the
formation-spirit, he couldn’t help but instead first ask, “Senior,
are you asking me to deal with this Eternal Emperor in the future?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am.” The elderly
formation-spirit nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
“Senior, you think too highly of me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal Emperors were
eternal figures who had succeeded in their Daomerge! Daolord Allgod
had died countless years ago but Emperor Melobo was still alive and
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had
chased after Emperor Melobo for countless years but had been unable
to slay him. In other words, there wasn’t an enormous difference in
power between the two. Given how much time had passed, Emperor Melobo
had to have grown more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m just
planting seeds to sprout in the future. I don’t expect all of them
to blossom.” The elderly formation-spirit explained, “In
addition, Emperor Melobo is an enemy of the entire Dao Alliance! You
came here with World God Dragonbinder of the Badlands Court. Given
that he trusts you, I imagine you should be a member of the Dao
Alliance as well. There’s no way a monstrously talented genius like
you would betray them for our enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is a ‘Dao
Alliance’?” Ning was rather dazed now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An alliance which
encompasses virtually all of the cultivators of the Endless
Territories.” The elderly formation-spirit looked at Ning. “Daolord
Badlands is a member as well, and long ago the seeds of good karma
were sown between the two of us as well. Haha…of the many seeds
that I have sown, his has been the most illustrious one to date. I
know all the disciples of the Badlands Court. Given that you came
alongside World God Dragonbinder, you should also be a member of the
Dao Alliance. Are you a member of the Badlands Court or…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was on
very good terms with Daolord Badlands, and they were willing to meet
each other in public. This meant they were probably on the same side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this ‘Dao
Alliance’ sounded quite powerful. An alliance comprising almost all
the cultivators of the Endless Territories? What an extravagant
claim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” The elderly
formation-spirit nodded. “I’ve heard Badlands speak of Vastheaven
Palace before. Yes, it is indeed part of the Dao Alliance as well.
I’m not surprised you haven’t heard of the Dao Alliance, as you
are still too young and weak. Even amongst World Gods, 99% of them
will have never heard of the Dao Alliance! Only the truly illustrious
World-level experts will be accepted into the Dao Alliance, as the
alliance is primarily composed of Samsara Daolords. I expect World
God Dragonbinder has perhaps heard of the Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The mysteries of the
Endless Territories are not for someone like you to comprehend.
However, there are some dangers that are aimed at all cultivators…and
Emperor Melobo is one of them.” The elderly formation-spirit looked
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But enough of that.
Once you become a World-level expert, your clan or sect will inform
you of some of our mysteries. In addition, my information is a bit
outdated.” The elderly formation-spirit nodded. “Well, then. What
treasure do you want?”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve passed the
trial. You deserve a treasure.” The elderly formation-spirit looked
at Ji Ning. “I have many treasures. Which treasure do you desire
the most? If I have it, I’ll give it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been still
musing about this ‘Dao Alliance’. Upon hearing the
formation-spirit’s question, he turned his attention to the
treasury. Hesitating slightly, he asked, “Do you have any scrolls
of the Mirrorsnow Painting?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” The
elderly formation-spirit shook his head. Daolord Allgod had left
behind many treasures, but the Mirrorsnow Painting was not one of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Ning
continued to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What treasure? What
treasure did he need? The opportunity to choose a treasure was a
priceless one. Many thoughts flitted through Ning’s mind. After
having experienced a treasure auction, Ning now knew of many more
treasures than he had in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guess I was wrong
to make that suggestion. You don’t even know what treasures I have.
How about this…what are you skilled in?” The formation-spirit
chuckled. “Aside from the Dao of the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m most skilled
in the Dao of the Sword. Aside from that, I’m also skilled in
lightning and in water,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s title was
‘Allgod’,” the elderly formation-spirit explained, “Precisely
because he was skilled in almost everything! Alchemy, formations…he
was a master of many Daos. Unfortunately, he truly wasn’t that
skilled in the Dao of the Sword. He was, however, extremely skilled
in the Dao of Lightning! However, you’ll be fighting against
enemies well above your level. Lightning-attribute techniques won’t
be that useful to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His old face wrinkled
as he frowned. Clearly, he was pondering this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have it!” The
formation-spirit looked at Ning, then reached out with his hand and
generated a spatial ripple from his palm. Moments later, a jade slip
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This jade slip now
belongs to you.” The formation-spirit passed it over to Ning,
sending it floating through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, the treasure
that was originally assigned to this treasury…” The elderly
formation-spirit tossed out a second item, a fiery idol. “This is
yours as well. My master once slew a vile Daolord who trained in the
Dao of Fire and took this idol from him. If you were to sell it,
you’d be able to sell it for one or two thousand cubes of chaos
nectar. As for the jade slip, it contains a secret art which Master
personally developed. Its value is incalculable. Not even the
combined value of four or five Eternal weapons would be a match for
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the idol to be
worth one or two thousand cubes made sense. The jade slip, however,
was truly amazing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the idol,
then turned to look at the jade slip. The jade slip was a inky jade
color, and one could see faint characters carved into the inky jade.
Ning sent his coresense into it, quickly discovering that it
contained a lifeblood oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself that prior to becoming a Samsara Daolord, I am not to
share this [Novessence Thunder] secret art with anyone else.” The
lifeblood oath was quite simply worded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all techniques
required lifeblood oaths to be sworn, be it treasures acquired from a
treasure auction or from one’s sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning swore
the oath, an enormous amount of information poured into his mind.
Daolord Allgod had left behind an utterly amazing lightning-attribute
secret art in this jade slip, and all of it was put on display for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This secret art was
known as the [Novessence Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod was an
ancient power who was extremely skilled in alchemy, formations,
artificing, and many other arts. At his level, only divine abilities
and secret arts that he personally developed would be a good fit for
him. Thus, he poured some of his insights into alchemy and artificing
into developing secret arts that were meant to give himself greater
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more power, the
better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had
created a total of nine mighty secret arts. These secret arts could
be used at long range, allowing him to effortlessly dominate other
experts on his level. In fact, he could even use them to tangle with
Eternal Emperors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the [Novessence
Thunder], it was one of those nine mighty secret arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A secret art like
this can actually exist?!” Ning was boggled as he read through the
information. “A secret art like this can exist?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique
completely destroyed Ning’s preconceptions regarding secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most techniques or
secret arts required the wielder to have certain insights into the
Dao, allowing him to use certain special technical tricks. The
forbidden arts used by God Emperor Blacklotus fell into this
category.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s [Nameless]
sword-art was a good example. It had multiple levels, and only when
one gained a high level of insight into the Dao of the Sword could
one use the increasingly profound levels of the [Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the
[Novessence Thunder] was completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like alchemy.
When forging pills, one would gather all sorts of rare and precious
ingredients, mix them together, use fire and energy to smelt them,
then form them into a marvelous pill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence
Thunder] required the wielder to harvest nine types of divine
lightning, mix them together in a complicated way that was akin to
alchemy, then transform them into a perfect thunder-attribute secret
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the mixing
process, Ning was rendered completely speechless upon reading it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was simply perfect.
It was like a work of absolute art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In his hands,
thunder and lightning were playthings that he could mold as he
pleased. He was able to effortless mix various types of lightning
together, joining them into an incredibly powerful secret art of
thunder.” Ning was truly stunned. He had once bound a Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent, and so he knew very well that lightning was
intrinsically a type of force that was extremely wild and savage.
Just binding and refining lightning was extremely difficult, to say
nothing of using quasi-alchemical methods to mix multiple types of
lightning together to form a secret art. This was truly unimaginable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two sections
to the [Novessence Thunder].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first section
required the user to harvest nine specific types of chaos lightning.
These nine types of chaos lightning, by themselves, weren’t even
capable of killing an ordinary World God. However, once you perfectly
mixed these nine types of ordinary chaos lightning together in a
certain manner through this secret art, you would be able to slay
master-class World Gods and suppress even supreme World Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
secret art completely surpassed any Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second section
involved harvesting nine specific types of Dao lightning. These types
of Dao lightning had to be naturally harvested and not artificially
manufactured, and they were incredibly rare. When Daolord Allgod
created this technique, he had been at the Verge. He had many types
of divine Dao lightning to choose from, but in the end he was only
able to find these nine types which were suitable. After binding and
smelting them together, he instantly rose to stand at the very peak
of power amongst Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely
difficult for a person to succeed in mastering this technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This truly is an
inconceivable secret art.” Ning couldn’t help but praise the
technique. “I’ve never seen anything like it. So lightning can be
manipulated in a way such as this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of
killing Emperor Melobo, Master poured all of his energy into coming
up with those nine mighty secret arts. Every single one of them was
so powerful as to allow any wielder to gaze down upon the other
heroes of the realm. Generally speaking, even Samsara Daolords at the
Verge would find it difficult to withstand these techniques. When the
nine secret arts are used together, they are capable of killing
almost any Samsara Daolord.” The formation-spirit was quite proud.
“Although the nine secret arts weren’t able to slay Emperor
Melobo, all nine of them were able to form domain-type effects that
were able to completely suppress him. As a result, Emperor Melobo’s
power in battle was weakened to roughly a half of his maximum power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having fully reviewed
this technique, he knew quite well that once one completely mastered
the first section of the [Novessence Thunder], one would be able to
unleash an awe-inspiring domain of endless lightning bolts that
stretched out more than a million kilometers. This was a lightning
domain! It could suppress even supreme World-level experts. Even if
Ning ended up encountering an extremely powerful figure which the
lightning domain couldn’t kill, it would still dramatically weaken
them and ensure they would only be able to unleash half of their full
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine secret arts…”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately,
Emperor Melobo still managed to escape in the end. He was simply too
skilled in fleeing techniques.” The formation-spirit sighed.
“Before Master died, he left all nine of his secret arts with the
Dao Alliance. If you render great services unto the Dao Alliance or
are able to sell them enough treasures, you’ll be able to learn all
nine techniques from them. However, these secrets are far more
valuable than even the ‘Pseudo Samsara pills’ which so many
World-level experts lust over! Even most Samsara Daolords would love
to have a chance to learn any one of these nine secret arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Secret arts were
incredibly powerful, but Ning also understood that mastering them
could be incredibly difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this case,
harvesting the nine types of lightning was just one of many difficult
tasks. What really mattered was the process of perfectly alchemizing
them together into a perfect blend. Actually succeeding in this
required the user to be very, very skilled in multiple areas. Daolord
Allgod was an ancient power who was skilled in alchemy, formations,
and more, which was why he was able to accomplish it. However, when
Ning viewed the technique he had two responses. First, he felt that
the technique was so beautiful it was like a perfect work of art.
Then, he felt a cold chill run down his spine. Training in this
technique would be incredibly hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I
have a powerful divine body. My divine power is far more robust than
others at my level, as is my soul. I should still be able to succeed
in this secret art,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve given you the
secret art. I hope that, in the future, you’ll at least be able to
reach Daolord Badlands’ level,” the formation-spirit said.
“Alright. Now that you’ve taken the treasure from this treasury,
hurry up and leave this place alongside your companions. This
treasure region is about to fall apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After speaking,
the formation-spirit’s body dispersed into particles of light, then
vanished. The light globe above the stone coffin also vanished, as
did the region of light around the coffin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
and Flamefairy Su Youji stared towards Ning from their original
positions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two called out to
him at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure region
began to shake as one of the walls split apart, revealing a new
passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure region
is about to crumble. We need to hurry up and leave.” Ning didn’t
have a chance to explain what had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” World
God Dragonbinder and Su Youji both understood that time was of the
essence. The three immediately moved at high speed towards that
distant passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous treasury
region began to completely fall apart. Boulders slammed down from the
ceiling, completely burying the passageway behind them as the
treasury sank down into the ground.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Su Youji, and
World God Dragonbinder travelled through the new passageway and
reached another part of the mountain. They all turned to glance at
the collapsed treasury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
congratulations! You acquired the treasures,” World God
Dragonbinder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are formidable
as always, Master.” Su Youji was filled with admiration for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, I
don’t quite understand…both the Flamefairy and I attempted the
trial but neither of us could retrieve the treasures. But you,
brother Ji Ning…” World God Dragonbinder couldn’t help but ask
this question. He knew that Ji Ning was most skilled with the sword.
If the trial was a trial of the Dao of the Sword, fine. But this
clearly was a trial of the Dao of Fire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Flamefairy,
who was just a hair away from becoming a Chaos Immortal, was unable
to pass this trial. How could Ji Ning have succeeded?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are certain
secrets and tricks to overcoming the treasury trials which Daolord
Allgod laid down.” This was the only thing Ning said in response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
and Su Youji both understood. The answer most likely involved some of
Ji Ning’s personal secrets, and so they no longer asked.
Cultivators sometimes would be placed under lifeblood oaths or simply
be unwilling to disclose their most powerful, life-saving techniques.
Thus, in general if someone didn’t wish to discuss something,
others wouldn’t force the topic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did acquire a
treasure from within this treasury.” Ning waved his hand, producing
a palm-sized fiery idol.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this?”
World God Dragonbinder’s gaze turned dreamy for a moment as his
attention became absorbed by this idol.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Flamefairy,
her response was even more exaggerated. As she stared at the fiery
idol, she was completely captivated by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a master-class World
God, Dragonbinder was quickly able to shake off the effect and come
to his senses. He looked at Ning in an admiring manner. “Brother Ji
Ning, I’m surprised that you are willing to show this treasure to
the two of us in such a casual fashion. This idol hides within it a
fire-attribute technique of tremendous profundity. The idol itself
has eight faces, with each face representing one of eight great
mysteries. This is something far more valuable than a mere
technique-holding jade slip. Jade slips merely contain information on
a technique; if you want to understand the technique, you have to
slowly meditate on it. This fiery idol, however, has eight different
auras and intents that can actually guide the cultivator in the
correct method to train in this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
become a master-class World God. What I now need to do is find my own
path and then follow it to become a Samsara Daolord! These techniques
are useless to me, but they are of tremendous use to the Flamefairy.”
World God Dragonbinder explained, “This idol has to be worth over a
thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Generally speaking, a person would
have to pay a hundred cubes to even be given the chance to merely
‘borrow’ this idol to look at it for a while. You truly are
generous to this retainer of yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is useless to me
but useful to her. I’m naturally going to give it to her. She’s
my retainer! If she becomes more powerful, that means my team will be
more powerful,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” World
God Dragonbinder nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different cultivators
treated their retainers in different manners. Some cultivators who
were on the same general level of power as their retainers would
treat them as friends and equals. However, if there was an enormous
disparity in power the retainers would often be treated like slaves!
When Daolord Windsource died, he even took quite a few of his
disciples with him, to say nothing of his retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During his time in the
Badlands Court, Ning had sparred with quite a few people. His
sword-arts were so profound that no Elder God or Ancestral Immortal
in the Badlands Court was a match for him. From this alone, World God
Dragonbinder could tell that Ji Ning was definitely comparable to a
World God in power! He had to be much more powerful than Su Youji.
For him to be courteous to her was one thing, but for him to give her
such a valuable legacy in such a straightforward manner was something
else. This sort of behavior was fairly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
to look at Su Youji. A look flickered through World God
Dragonbinder’s eyes as he turned to look at her as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji had already
shut her eyes and vague ripples of fire had begun to swirl around
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sudden
enlightenment?” World God Dragonbinder said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
They were inside the Allgod Estate, a very dangerous place. Generally
speaking, no one would engage in meditation here. If Su Youji was
here by herself and a prajna-state of sudden enlightenment descended
upon her, she would probably break it right away. She would first
leave the ruins, find a safe place to stay, then re-engage in her
meditations. However, in doing so she would’ve lost the benefit
from this prajna-state of sudden enlightenment. Thankfully, she was
alongside Ji Ning and World God Dragonbinder. She trusted that the
two would protect her, and so she allowed herself to be drawn into
the prajna-state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
waved his hand, causing Su Youji to be drawn into his estate-treasure
and be placed atop an island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning exerted his will,
causing that island to be completely separated from the rest of the
estate-world. As the master of this estate-world, Ning was able to
ensure that there was absolutely no way that Su Youji’s moment of
enlightenment would be disturbed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems likely that
the Flamefairy is going to break through to become a Chaos Immortal.”
World God Dragonbinder let out an impressed sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“Youji was always quite talented. In the past, however, she never
had any good teachers. Although my big brother Daolord Solesky gave
her a few tips, he did so in a rather casual manner. This idol,
however, has a truly systemized and complete technique within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This idol can
guide someone to become a master-class World-level figure. Haha, Ji
Ning…it seems you are about to acquire a World-level retainer.”
World God Dragonbinder laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can feel the
pressure already.” Ning laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and make
your own breakthrough as well. Your sword-arts are as impressive as
the sword-arts of quite a number of World-level Sword Immortals that
I know,” World God Dragonbinder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning himself
could sense that he had reached a bottleneck in the ‘Great
Firmament’ stance. However, he was fairly close to making his
breakthrough. The [Nameless] sword-art was an extremely profound
sword-art; upon mastering this next level, he would form a Sword
World that was far stronger than that of most Sword Immortals! As for
Ning’s own ‘Blackmist’ stance, it was a stance that was fairly
close in power to the ‘Great Firmament’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’m just
a hair’s breadth away, that tiny bit of distance has prevented
countless Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals from taking the next
step.” Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” World God
Dragonbinder couldn’t help but think about himself and the many
other cultivators who were trapped as master-class World-level
experts and were unable to make a breakthrough. “A single step that
can be as wide as a moat that separates the heavens and the earth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That final step was the
hardest step to take.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many, many
master-class World-level experts. Even the Starlord of Fogstone, who
had only trained for a fairly short period of time, had become a
master-class World God. So had God Emperor Blackstone! But how few of
them would become into Samsara Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go view some
other places,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and World God
Dragonbinder were fairly strong, and the Ten Thousand Mountains were
merely the outermost layer of the Allgod Estate. There were actually
very few World-level experts here; most cultivators present were
Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals. Thus, the two were essentially
able to roam through this region as they pleased. No one dared to
antagonize the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than two years had gone by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how powerful Ning
and Dragonbinder were, the ‘outer region’ truly was of no
challenge to them. This was especially true for World God
Dragonbinder. He was an exalted master-class World God; he naturally
had to enter the Fog Sea to test himself! And yet, because they
needed to stand guard for the Flamefairy, he had remained by Ning’s
side instead of venturing into the more dangerous Fog Sea region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to have
troubled you, brother Dragonbinder. I’ve made you waste quite a bit
of time here in the outer region.” Ning sat down on a stone as he
held out a flask of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just two or
three years, and I’ll be able to see a new Chaos Immortal be born.
No big deal at all. Uh…wow. This is good wine. Good lord, brother
Ji Ning…how much money did you spend on Immortal wine?” World God
Dragonbinder was guzzling wine with gusto.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten cubes,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice, nice.” World
God Dragonbinder certainly wasn’t willing to spend this much money
on wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had departed
from the Windsource Ruins, he was laden down with many treasures.
Thus, he chose to spend ten cubes of his wealth to purchase a great
deal of fine Immortal wine. He was living in the Badlands Court and
would often receive their disciples as his guests. How could he allow
himself to be lacking in wine? The Immortal wine he had purchased had
been created through many different valuable ingredients. Once it was
consumed, it would actually help the imbiber by replenishing his
Immortal ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dim sound rang out
from the heavens above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated Ning and
Dragonbinder both turned their heads to stare at the heavens. The
vague image of a vortex of chaos energy could be seen swirling in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can even see the
chaos vortex from within the Allgod Estate. There has to be an
enormous flood of chaos energy in the outside world.” World God
Dragonbinder revealed a look of delight…and his words were spot on.
An utterly enormous vortex of chaos energy had formed in the skies
above the Allgod Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamefairy
should’ve begun her breakthrough,” World God Dragonbinder said.
“Let everything return to the primordial chaos from whence it came.
Let the Dao-seed grow and let all things be renewed…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt eager as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had received certain
teachings from Daolord Solesky, and so he knew that breaking through
to become a World-level expert would result a transformation on a
fundamental level. When he thought of Su Youji’s transformation, he
felt even more anticipation towards his own. He had the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods], the [Sole True Body], and the mysterious
azureflower mist energy. This was why he was comparable to a World
God despite being an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One could imagine how
enormous his transformation would be upon becoming a World God! He
would be on a completely different level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long period of time
went by, but neither Ning nor Dragonbinder were in a rush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A peerless beauty
suddenly appeared, wreathed in flames. She knelt down towards Ning
and said gratefully, “Youji shall never forget the great kindness
you have shown her, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
know the importance of repaying the kindness of others.” World God
Dragonbinder nodded. There were some retainers who would begin to
treat their masters with disdain once they broke through and reached
a higher level of power. Once their lifeblood oaths were completed,
they would immediately depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are now a
World-level expert. Hurry up and rise.” Ning hurriedly held the
Flamefairy to her feet. He could sense the aura of a Chaos Immortal
emanating from the rings of fire that wreathed her body, and he
couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 27 - The First Mirrorsnow Painting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s retainer
had just become a Chaos Immortal, but he himself had yet to make a
breakthrough! Still, Ning was fairly happy. At least he got a
powerful assistant out of this event! However, Su Youji was a new
Chaos Immortal who didn’t even have a suitable Dao weapon to use.
Thus, she was actually weaker than most World-level experts; she
could at most be considered to have reached the lowest benchmark of
that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New Chaos Immortals
with no suitable treasures and who hadn’t had the chance to
solidify their powers were actually quite weak. Usually, they’d
find a private location and spend a few thousand years in solitary
cultivation. Only when they increased in power to become comparable
to normal World-level experts would they emerge from seclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Flamefairy. This breakthrough you just made represents a fundamental
transformation,” World God Dragonbinder said with a laugh. “From
this day forth, you will no longer be the same person you once were.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s eyes were
shining with light and her heart was filled with many emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless scenes from
the past began to flash through her mind. Thanks to the technique she
created, she was a woman of absolutely stunning charm. As a result,
quite a few cultivators had desired to become Dao-companions. Some of
them acted properly towards her, but others had been stuck at the
Elder God or Ancestral Immortal level for so long that they had lost
their rationality along with their hopes of making a breakthrough. As
a result, they abandoned themselves to vices and would often try to
kidnap alluring woman and use them to sate their own lusts. Someone
like Su Youji, who was both powerful and mesmerizing, drove these men
absolutely wild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s technique
was special. Before becoming a World-level expert, she could not
allow herself to lose her virginity. Thus, in many cases her only
choice was to flee from those men rather than to submit to them. She
lived quite an arduous life as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…finally…”
Su Youji could sense how powerful she had become. The Jindan chaos
region inside her body was filled with an enormous amount of World
energy, giving her a sense of absolute power and control over herself
and her surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
I am now Chaos Immortal Su Youji.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Chaos Immortal would
be welcomed with open arms by any of the organizations of the
Badlands Court. They would be ranked as one of the most high-level
figures and be given tremendous power and authority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the Flamefairy
has completed her breakthrough…brother Ji Ning, let us part ways
here.” World God Dragonbinder said, “I’m planning to pay a
visit to the Fog Sea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for
everything, senior apprentice-brother Dragonbinder,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter.”
World God Dragonbinder smiled as he began to walk away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Su Youji
come back to her senses. She hurriedly said, “Thank you, big
brother Dragonbinder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wager others would
have begged for a chance to serve as your protector, little sister!”
World God Dragonbinder’s voice rang out from afar as he moved
further and further away from them. Soon, only Ning and Su Youji were
left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
Su Youji was filled with gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.” Ning
waved his hand, causing that palm-sized fiery idol to appear once
more. When she saw the idol appear, Su Youji’s eyes instantly lit
up. The techniques contained within this idol were a perfect fit for
her. The idol had a total of eight faces, one of which was related to
a charm technique. This was the reason why she was immediately
stimulated upon seeing the idol, resulting in her breaking through to
become a Chaos Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s eyes
blazed with eagerness as she stared at that idol. This idol would
truly be of tremendous use to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.” Ning
handed it over to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Su Youji
didn’t know what to say or do. She had taken part in the treasure
auction as well, and thus she knew exactly how valuable a treasure
like this was. It would probably start at a reserve price of roughly
a thousand cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m giving it to
you, so take it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…I…” Su
Youji hesitated. In the end, this fiery idol was simply too alluring
to her. She said in a low voice, “Master, just let me view it for
an hour. I’ll memorize the technique within it then give it back to
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“What’s the point of just memorizing the technique? This fiery
idol has eight different types of conceptual intents radiating from
it. It’ll be of tremendous benefit to you in your cultivation. And
I’m not giving it to you, I’m just letting you use it. When I
want it back, you’ll have to return it to me. So take it.” Ning
pressed the fiery idol into Su Youji’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s heart
quivered as Ning took her hand into his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although she had served
him for quite some time, this was actually the first time they had
touched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’m
planning to go into the Fog Sea as well,” Ning said. “Go ahead
and enter the estate-world and focus on solidifying your current
foundation. You’ve just broken through, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need, Master.”
Su Youji waved her hand, causing the fiery idol to be drawn into her
Jindan chaos region. “I only need to spend part of my time working
on this idol. With it, I should be able to solidify my foundation in
less than a century. Your golem is by my side as well; once I enter
it and command it, I’ll be able to unleash tremendous power from
within. I won’t be in any danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With such a detailed
technique and helpful idol, her path to becoming a master-class Chaos
Immortal was clear. It naturally wouldn’t take her much time to
solidify her foundation. If she didn’t have the idol and instead
had to work on her own, she probably would’ve needed a thousand
years in order to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might as well.”
Ning nodded. Although Su Youji didn’t have a Dao weapon, she did
have that golem. If danger arose, she could instantly hide herself
within that golem. She really wouldn’t be in much danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let us enter
the Fog Sea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
stare off into the distance, where the vast, billowing Fog Sea could
be seen. He could sense the ripples emanating from the Mirrorsnow
Painting he had bound and its desire to enter the Fog Sea and reunite
with the other painting there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fog Sea was part of
the ‘inner region’ of the Allgod Estate. It was far more
dangerous than the Ten Thousand Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Fog billowed
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood atop an
earthen hill, staring off into the distance. Even at his level of
visual acuity, the fog ensured that he could only see to a distance
of a few hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s up ahead.”
Ning pointed straight ahead. Thanks to his Mirrorsnow Painting, Ning
could easily determine the location of his target. The toughest part
of being in the Fog Sea was that one would be unable to find one’s
bearings. Anyone who spent a bit of time within it would quickly
discover that they could no longer tell the directions apart. This
was true even for World-level experts. But of course, if you walked
in one direction for a long enough period of time, sooner or later
you’d make it out of the Fog Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking forward
for tens of thousands of kilometers, Ning saw a placid, almost
mirror-like lake up ahead. The lake was quite wide, so vast that Ning
couldn’t see the other side of it. It was so still here that not
even any ripples could be seen on the lake’s surface. Ning did,
however, get a vague sense of danger emanating from the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji looked towards
Ning. “I sense as though this lake…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I sensed it as
well.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we walk on
the surface of the lake? Fly over it? Or go around it?” Su Youji
waited for Ning to decide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned as he
glanced at the great lake before them. Finally, he said, “Let’s
go around it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” This was
Su Youji’s preference as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two began to circle
around the lake. However, the lake truly was quite enormous. Based on
how much time they spent walking around it, Ning judged that it had
to be more than a hundred thousand kilometers long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ripples suddenly
appeared on the surface of the formerly-still lake. Then, a golden
head began to silently emerge from the waters beneath. This golden
head had a pair of golden wings where a human would have ears. It
stared off into the distance towards a place which Ji Ning and Su
Youji had walked past just a short while ago. Some time later, the
strange creature slowly sank beneath the waves once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji
continued their journey after going past the lake, moving with slow
caution. Whenever they encountered a place they felt was dangerous,
they would avoid it. This was the Fog Sea, after all. This was a
terrifying place which spelled death for nearly half the World-level
experts who entered it! Even though Ning had the power of a
master-class World God, he still didn’t dare to act rashly. In
addition, his true goal was merely to find the Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are almost there.
We should be less than fifty thousand kilometers away,” Ning said.
He had spent more than a month in here with Su Youji and had walked
more than ten million kilometers. The reason why it had taken them
this long was because they had to avoid quite a few dangerous areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The past month had been
fairly safe. They had only engaged in battle a single time when they
had encountered a scorpion-shaped bugbeast that had just barely
reached the World level of power. Ning had simply taken out his
Pentabolt Gourd and effortless killed the bugbeast with a
thunderblast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s up ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji had
just reached a mountain. Halfway up the mountain, there was an
elegant-looking palace which had three characters carved onto it: Yi
River Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yi River Palace?”
Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Su Youji glanced at Ning, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This doesn’t make
sense.” Ning frowned. The Fog Sea had quite a few dangerous
locations within it. Many generations of cultivators had ventured
within the Fog Sea, resulting in many of its dangerous locations
being marked down. The Yi River Palace was one such location! It held
valuable treasures but was also filled with tremendous danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
intelligence report which Ning had acquired from Daolord Solesky,
although the Mirrorsnow Painting was in the Fog Sea it wasn’t
located within the Yi River Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For some reason, the
Mirrorsnow Painting must’ve been moved from its original location
into the Yi River Palace,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning gave the
gates to the Yi River Palace a hard shove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the gates
slowly swung open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in,”
Ning said. “Youji, the deeper parts of the Yi River Palace are
filled with tremendous danger. We can’t get in too deep. Let me
scout out the outer perimeter of the palace first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Youji
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two carefully
stepped into the estate. The Yi River Palace was extremely large and
it had a front hall, a main hall, an inner hall, and many side halls.
According to the information Ning had, the other halls of the Yi
River Palace were fairly safe, but the main hall was filled with
tremendous danger. However, the main hall also had the most
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mirrorsnow
Painting. It doesn’t seem to be in the main palace…” Ning could
sense from his attunement to his own painting that this second one
was actually located in a side hall.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led Su Youji
towards the direction of the side hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of gray fog
quickly surged out from that distant side hall, moving far faster
than the limits of the Heavenly Daos as it poured out of the Yi River
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That thing is
carrying the Mirrorsnow Painting!” Ning’s face changed. “Chase
it down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense that the
Mirrorsnow Painting had originally been within the side hall, but it
was now receding from him at high speed. Clearly, it was being taken
away by that gray streak of mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji
immediately chased after it at high speed. Ning had always been
extremely fast, while Su Youji was now a Chaos Immortal. Thanks to
her powerful Immortal energy and the Jindan chaos region inside her
body supporting her, she was now also able to easily overcome the
limits of the Heavenly Daos and move just a tiny bit slower than Ning
himself did. But of course, this was with Ning not using the
Thunderlight Wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An inch-thick
streak of golden light shot out of Ning’s eyes, allowing him to
clearly make out the true form of that fleeing streak of gray fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it looked like
gray fog, it was actually a strange beast that had a crocodilian body
and a dragon-like head. Its four stubby legs propelled it forward at
high speed, allowing it move faster than the limits of the Heavenly
Daos as gray mist emanated from its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A bugbeast of some
sort.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It most likely is
one of the bugbeasts which Daolord Allgod once reared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and Su Youji
were able to see and identify the creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many bugbeasts lived
within the Fog Sea region. It must be understood that Daolord Allgod
was skilled in many things, including alchemy, artificing,
formations, and more. He had also reached an extremely high level of
skill in the art of rearing bugbeasts. Even though he had died long
ago, certain formations within the Fog Sea region continuously
nurtured and gave birth to multiple generations of World-level
bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAR!” The
graymist beast let out a howl. Its body suddenly split into nine
different pieces, each of which began to flee towards a different
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about fleeing!” Ning roared. He pulled out a giant gourd with his
left hand, immediately uncorking it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless thunderbolts
blasted out from within the gourd, instantly covering the entire
region but centering around the area which included the nine streaks
of gray mist that were beginning to flee. The [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] technique was limited to the speed of the Heavenly Daos, but
this Pentabolt Gourd which Ning had purchased during the treasure
auction contained five different types of chaos lightning, each of
which was able to effortlessly breach the speed of light. They all
moved much faster than Ning himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five types of
lightning crackled throughout the area and thundered around the gray
mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“EEEEE! An
ear-piercing, soul-piercing cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight of the nine
streaks of gray mist instantly vanished. The remaining streak of gray
mist quickly began to expand in size, its scaly crocodilian body
beginning to emerge as well. The beast’s body was resisting the
attacks of these five types of chaos lightning, and it turned to
glare at Ning, its grayish-white eyes filled with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over that
sword-ki diagram and I’ll spare your life,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll never catch
me.” The creature’s gravelly voice rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scaly crocodilian
creature once more transformed into mist. This time, the misty gray
aura surrounding it brightened dramatically as it began to fly off
into the distance at a speed which rendered Ning speechless. Even if
he used his Thunderlight Wings, he still wouldn’t be able to catch
up to it. His only choice was to use the Pentabolt Gourd to release
those five streaks of chaos lightning to slow the creature down…and
yet, although the creature seemed to be weakened by the lightning it
didn’t slow down in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t catch up
to it, Master.” Su Youji was worried. The bugbeast had already
flown out of the range of the five types of lightning. This place was
quite dangerous, and Ning didn’t dare to let the lightning reach
out to a much greater distance, for fear of accidentally striking and
irritating other powerful bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that
it’s been injured.” Ning chuckled. The final blasts of lightning
had injured the creature. Although it had managed to escape, its aura
had been noticeably weakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be able
to escape me.” Ning could continuously sense the exact location of
the Mirrorsnow Painting. So long as the creature remained within the
Allgod Estate, Ning would still be able to sense its location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is up ahead. It
isn’t moving,” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning and Su Youji
saw the creature. It was a crocodilian bugbeast with black scales,
and it was resting as it lay atop a giant boulder. It instantly
noticed Ning’s arrival and immediately transformed into an aura of
gray mist as it once more began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bugbeasts were
artificially created lifeforms. They had tremendous strength and
certain special gifts, and they used these advantages when they
fought. However, they didn’t have divine power or Immortal energy.
Thus, they were unable to bind magic treasures to themselves. In
other words, the bugbeast hadn’t been able to bind the sword-ki
painting and thus couldn’t sense Ning’s location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning didn’t
have enough time to chase after the creature. He instead once more
pulled out the Pentabolt Gourd and released those five types of chaos
lightning to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura of the fleeing
streak of gray mist began to noticeably weaken yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji
continued their chase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense ripples
coming from over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a battle
happening nearby.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two men who were seated
in the lotus position rose to their feet. One was dressed in golden
robes while the other was dressed in black robes. Both had dark,
swarthy skin, and their faces were covered with green floral tattoos.
Both emanated auras of tremendous power as well. One was a World God,
the other a Chaos Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.” The two exchanged a glance, then quietly began to move
towards the direction of the ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is still
fleeing.” Ning and Su Youji continued their pursuit of the
bugbeast. By now, the bugbeast could tell that the two cultivators
probably had a way to track it and so it continued to frantically run
as fast as it could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s moving
farther and farther away.” Ning was worried. “The bugbeast knows
the Fog Sea much better than us. It’ll probably end up hiding
itself within a dangerous location. We have to catch up to it soon.
If too much time passes, we’ll be in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HALT!” Suddenly,
an icy shout rang out from afar and blasted into the ears of Ning and
Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji had
been flying at high speed. Both frowned and turned to look at the two
figures which had appeared behind them. These two figures both
emanated auras of power and savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su
Youji’s face tightened as she sent a quick mental message. “I
know these two. One is known as World God Foxblaze while the other is
Chaos Immortal Foxbold. The two belong to the same race and are
extremely savage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oho, isn’t this
Flamefairy Su Youji?” Chaos Immortal Foxbold was dressed in golden
robes, and his eyes lit up when he saw the Flamefairy. “You
actually broke through to become a Chaos Immortal! I hadn’t heard
the news. It must be recent. Huh. Come to think of it, a short while
ago the chaos energy within the Allgod Estate was in a state of great
turmoil. Was that when you made your breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Su Youji?” The
black-robed World God Foxblaze’s eyes lit up as well. “Oho, what
a rare treat…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was a peerless
beauty of tremendous charm. After becoming a Chaos Immortal, her aura
and demeanor had only grown more graceful. Both of these World-level
experts felt a certain itchiness in their hearts when they saw her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please make way! We
are busy,” Su Youji barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make way? Su Youji,
you just recently became a World-level expert. Instead of finding a
safe place to stabilize your foundation, you instead came here to the
Fog Sea. You are lucky that it was the two of us who found you.”
World God Foxblaze laughed coldly. “It would be simplicity itself
for us to kill you, but we’ll give you a chance to stay alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Newly ascended
World-level experts were very weak, especially Chaos Immortals. Chaos
Immortals had fairly weak bodies; when they first made their
breakthrough, they could be considered as having just barely reached
the World-level threshold of power. Although World God Foxblaze and
his friend weren’t that powerful, they had still been alive for a
very long period of time. It would indeed be quite easy for them to
slay a newly ascended Chaos Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. We’ll
give you a chance to live.” Chaos Immortal Foxbold stared
appraising at Su Youji, licking his lips. “It’s simple. You
simply need to swear a lifeblood oath to be our slave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slave?” A layer of
frost appeared on Su Youji’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. You
are a World-level expert as well; we won’t make things too hard for
you. After you become our slave, all you’ll have to do is engage in
‘dual cultivation’ with us every so often. Dual cultivation is a
source of great joy, as you’ll soon come to know.” World God
Foxblaze’s eyes grew colder. “But if you refuse, today is the day
you die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All we ask is that
you engage in ‘dual cultivation’ with us. You’ll have a much
higher position than all the rest of our slaves,” Chaos Immortal
Foxbold agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had many women,
but female Chaos Immortals of such peerless beauty and charm were
incredibly rare. Most importantly of all, Su Youji had just recently
become a Chaos Immortal. She was still very weak and would be easily
captured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of their gazes
were fixed upon Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was merely an Elder
God. The two completely ignored him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you are
going a bit too far.” Ning’s voice rang out. He didn’t want to
fight as that would distract him from chasing after the fleeing
bugbeast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World-level experts
are speaking. How dare you interrupt us, you ant?” World God
Foxblaze looked at Ning, a lofty look in his eyes. He naturally felt
complete contempt towards a mere Elder God like Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny Elder God, how
dare you speak so rashly before us? I was planning to simply enslave
you as well. I suppose I might as well just kill you instead.”
Chaos Immortal Foxbold glanced at Ning as well, a similar look of
arrogance in his gaze. He, too, felt as though he was speaking to an
ant.

Chapter 29 - Slaying World-Level Experts
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An island within Ji
Ning’s estate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wild Dog. Blacksun.”
A booming voice echoed across the great island. Elder God Wilddog and
Elder God Blacksun had been seated amongst their fellow Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals, eating and chatting, but now the two
immediately rose to their feet. They called out in unison, “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take control of your
golems and await my signal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Wilddog and
Elder God Blacksun simultaneously transformed into two tall, muscular
black golems. Previously, the golems had been fiery red in color, but
they had been cosmetically altered and recolored to black in order to
conceal their true power. Once you bound a golem, you could
completely withdraw and suppress its aura of power. In fact, golems
with spirits controlling them such as Rocky were almost like living
creatures. Rocky was able to completely suppress his own aura and
transform into a boulder that not even Ning would be able to detect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two black golems
stood there at the edges of the island, awaiting Ning’s summons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re about to
enter combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. We’ve been
waiting forever for a real battle like this. All we were doing prior
to this was nothing more than sparring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both were filled with
an eagerness to do battle. The golems they commanded filled them with
tremendous self-confidence. It must be understood that Ning had to
spend more than six hundred cubes of chaos nectar to purchase these
three golems…and that was at the discounted treasure auction price.
Normally, each of these three golems would go for significantly more
than two hundred cubes of chaos nectar. Each of the three were
individually more powerful than Rocky, and they were able to join
together in a formation as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside world. The
Fog Sea region of the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze and
Chaos Immortal Foxbold both glanced disdainfully at Ning, ignoring
him after mocking him. In their eyes, he truly was nothing more than
an ant-like presence. They were on a completely different level of
power; why would they pay him any heed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes turned once
more to Flamefairy Su Youji. World God Foxblaze spoke out: “Su
Youji, if you wish to live a long life, you have to learn when to
compromise. We won’t make your lifeblood oath too harsh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you have to do
is serve us in dual cultivation. It’ll be fun.” Chaos Immortal
Foxbold truly looked forward to enjoying the pleasing company of this
truly ravishing female Chaos Immortal. He never thought that a chance
like this would come so quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two alternated
between threatening her and persuading her. They wouldn’t be able
to overpower her and force her to serve them; even if they did manage
to capture her, she would be able to effortlessly self-detonate
herself. It must be understood that even slaves could easily choose
to self-detonate themselves. Thus, while an owner could oppress and
coerce their slaves, they still had ensure that their slaves weren’t
driven to utter despair. Otherwise, their slaves could choose to be
disobedient. When Daolord Windsource had commanded his slaves to
accompany him into death, many of them had cursed and railed at him
for his actions. Alas, all they could do was curse, nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, Su Youji.”
The two stared hungrily at the Flamefairy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji’s face was
so cold, it looked as though it was covered by a layer of frost. She
sent to the nearby Ning, “Master, what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since they insist on
dying…then let’s just go ahead and spend a little bit of time to
get rid of them.” Ning glanced at the two World-level figures.
“Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be honest, Ning
truly didn’t wish to get into this fight. Killing World-level
experts wasn’t a simple task. World God Foxblaze was an elite World
God while Chaos Immortal Foxbold was merely an ordinary one. Ning was
completely capable of slaying the two of them, but it would still
take him quite a bit of time. This was why he had been hoping he
could talk the two of them into getting out of his way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can hunt down the
bugbeast later. Given that I can sense its location, I’m sure it’ll
hide somewhere it feels is very safe.” The more Ning thought about
it, the angrier he became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Su Youji
suddenly clenched her teeth and said aloud, “Show me your lifeblood
oath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, that’s
more like it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good!
What a fine beauty you are. Don’t worry. We couldn’t bear to
mistreat you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze and
Chaos Immortal Foxbold were delighted upon hearing her words. Just
like that, a lovely female Chaos Immortal had fallen into their
clutches. What a stroke of great luck! World God Foxblaze waved his
hand, causing a golden pearl to fly out. “This is my oathstone.
Take a good luck, my pretty. If there’s anything you don’t like,
we can change it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ehehe.” Chaos
Immortal Foxbold felt more and more excited. This was better than
finding an entire stash of valuable treasures. They never would’ve
even imagined in their wildest dreams that such a female slave would
fall into their clutches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I simply can’t
believe how lucky we are. As soon as Su Youji broke through to become
a Chaos Immortal, she ran into the two of us.” Both of them were
filled with eagerness. They could already visualize the fantastic
scenes of the two of them cavorting with her, causing their hearts to
blaze with lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing next
to Su Youji. His eyes suddenly turned cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed within
his estate-world as a black gourd suddenly appeared in front of him.
The black gourd vomited out countless streaks of lightning,
completely filling the region with five types of chaos lightning that
surrounded and attacked Chaos Immortal Foxbold and World God
Foxblaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit!” The two
blanched as they saw this happen. Chaos Immortal Foxbold’s robes
instantly glowed with light, forming a protective barrier around him.
Alast, the five types of chaos lightning were simply too powerful,
causing the barrier to completely shatter as they crashed straight
through it and against Foxbold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of flying
daggers had also appeared around Chaos Immortal Foxbold, but they
were only able to deflect part of the lightning. The rest of the
lightning crashed directly against his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An ugly look was
on Chaos Immortal Foxbold’s face as he vomited out a mouthful of
blood. He sent frantically, “Save me, big brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit. That’s one
powerful lightning treasure.” World God Foxblaze instantly was both
enraged and unnerved. “Hold on for a short while. I’ll capture Su
Youji and take that gourd of hers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gourd was hovering
in front of Ning, who was standing right next to Su Youji. Thus, both
of the enemies believed the gourd to belong to Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five types of
lightning continued to furiously attack the two World-level experts.
However, World God Foxblaze was quite a powerful figure, and he was
dressed in a suit of low-grade Dao armor. His divine body was
completely capable of withstanding the attacks from these five types
of divine lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze
transformed into a streak of light, flying towards Su Youji with a
furious look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three golems suddenly
appeared out of nowhere. One was Rocky the stone titan, while the
other two were pitch-black golems. These three golems simultaneously
charged towards Chaos Immortal Foxbold from three separate
directions! World God Foxblaze was sprinting straight towards Ji Ning
and Su Youji and so wasn’t able to turn in time, allowing all three
golems to charge straight past him and towards Chaos Immortal
Foxbold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are fast!”
World God Foxblaze’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Save me, big
brother!” Chaos Immortal Foxbold was shocked as well. When he saw
those three golems speeding towards him, he immediately understood
that they were definitely World-level golems. He was utterly
terrified and quickly sent out a distress call. It must be understood
that he merely had the power of an ordinary World-level expert and
was merely a Chaos Immortal. He had already been driven to
distraction and unnerved by the five types of divine lightning that
filled every inch of this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now three golems
were charging towards him as well? What was he supposed to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The black
golem controlled by Elder God Blacksun struck out with a massive
fist, sending an enormously powerful punch towards Chaos Immortal
Foxbold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Elder God
Wilddog delivered a vicious kick towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAR!” Rocky
sent two furious palm-blows towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five types of
lightning in the surrounding area continued to furiously assault
Chaos Immortal Foxbold as well. As for World God Foxblaze, he had
charged towards Ji Ning and Su Youji at maximum speed and was
completely unable to make it back in time to save Foxbold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems had an innate
advantage in raw strength to begin with, with less than one in a
thousand World Gods being comparable to World-level golems in
strength. The only way you could beat a golem was by suppressing them
with your superior insights into the Dao, but Chaos Immortal Foxbold
had already been completely shut down by Ning’s Pentabolt Gourd
attack. All he could do was scream repeatedly as he tried to use his
blade barrier to block the attacks. “NOOOOO!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal Foxbold
was reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” World God
Foxblaze had been charging towards Ning and Su Youji, but upon seeing
this he blanched. “Those golems are way too powerful. Those are no
ordinary golems! Each of them has to be worth at least a hundred
cubes of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Right at this
moment, Su Youji transformed into a black golem as well. World God
Foxblaze was now quite close to her and she didn’t dare fight him
in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Upon
seeing Su Youji transform into a black golem, World God Foxblaze felt
as though his heart had been gripped by icy fingers. Four golems? He
could tell that every single one of those golems was probably
comparable to him in strength. If the four joined forces, they would
completely dominated him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
World God Foxblaze no longer had any interest in tangling with Su
Youji. He transformed into a streak of light, beginning to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A pair of
lightning wings suddenly appeared on Ning’s back. The wings
fluttered slightly, sending Ning flying out at tremendous speed.
Although World God Foxblaze also flew fairly quickly, the five types
of lightning slowed him down somewhat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” World God
Foxblaze stared at the figure who had suddenly appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
stood there, his Thunderlight Wings spread wide and a blood-red sword
in his hands. The youth stared at Foxblaze coldly. “You won’t be
able to escape!”

Chapter 30 - Willing to be Enslaved
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze was
astonished by the speed of this white-robed youth, and he was able to
tell right away that the Thunderlight Wings on Ning’s back were
quite extraordinary. However, he wasn’t afraid; rather, he was
delighted. If he killed this Elder God, then this extraordinary
treasure would become his, right? He didn’t even consider the
possibility that he might not be able to defeat this Elder God. Even
the most monstrously talented Elder Gods would at most be comparable
to ordinary World Gods…and he was an elite one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny Elder God, you
overestimate your abilities. Die!” World God Foxblaze drew out a
curved scimitar, then used it to chop towards Ning. It was like a
streak of crescent moonlight had suddenly struck out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning showed no mercy at
all, immediately using his most powerful attack with his most
powerful weapon, the Eternal weapon Violetjewel. He delivered a
powerful, furious overhead chop with Violetjewel, his weapon moving
far faster than the speed of light. As Violetjewel struck out in a
cruel blur, Ning also activated as much of its quintessence core as
he could, giving his weapon an utterly terrifying amount of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment in time,
Violetjewel was so incredibly sharp and powerful that even an
ordinary mortal who casually brandished it would unleash a blast of
sword-ki that could easily chop a mountain apart. But of course,
there was no way that a mortal would ever come into possession of a
weapon such as this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel’s
sword-light clashed head-on against the crescent moon of saber-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crescent moon of
saber-light was blasted apart, while World God Foxblaze was knocked
flying backwards. He stared at the midair figure of Ning, his eyes
absolutely huge and filled with disbelief. How was this possible?
How? He was an exalted World God who had been alive and training for
countless years and had reached the ‘elite’ level. How could he
possibly be at a completely disadvantage in this fight?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was least a full
level’s worth of difference between him and his foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Elder God actually
had the power of a master-class World God? How was this possible? How
could anyone be this much of a freak? Even if this Elder God was
wielding an Eternal weapon, it should’ve been impossible for him to
be this powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The terrifying
force of Ning’s blow had knocked World God Foxblaze flying
backwards, and the five types of lightning in the area continued to
furiously hammer down against his body. Foxblaze’s situation was
growing more dire by the moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black golems
and the stone titan quickly charged towards World God Foxblaze. Su
Youji’s black golem was already quite close to Ning, and so it was
the first to arrive and strike at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The black
golem’s fierce claws lashed out with dominating power, leaving a
cruel fiery blur behind in the air as the golem struck at Foxblaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Although Foxblaze
frantically lifted up his scimitar to block, he was knocked backwards
yet again. Although he was actually roughly on par with the black
golems, he had been completely knocked off his game by Ning’s
attack. That first failure was causing a cascade of problems for him,
and the entire situation was extremely grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Elder God
Wilddog and Elder God Blacksun’s golems arrived and began to
attack, as did the stone titan Rocky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
charged towards Foxblaze as well, leaving a trail of dazzling
electric light in the air behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Foxblaze was completely
trapped!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the four
golems were somewhat inferior to him in technique and skill, they
were superior to him in power and speed. He was able to to deal with
one of them but four was simply too much. The worst thing was, the
white-robed Elder God he had thought to be the weakest cultivator
present was actually the most terrifying figure of them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a terrifying
Elder God who had the power of a master-class World God! These types
of Elder Gods only existed in legends!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four golems, five
types of divine lightning, those electric wings…I was wrong. I was
completely wrong from the start! How could Su Youji possibly afford
treasures such as these? They most likely all belong to that
white-robed Elder God! Su Youji is merely his servant as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-n-no…I can’t
just die here…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although World God
Foxblaze felt regret and self-pity for being driven to such dires
straits, he also felt a powerful urge to stay alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform!” World
God Foxblaze instantly transformed to gain a total of six arms, each
of which was now wielding a scimitar. His aura grew slightly more
powerful as well, and even his eyes began to turn red. Clearly, he
was now in an utterly berserk state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only way for him to
survive was for him to go all out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” He
immediately charged towards the stone titan, because he could tell
right away that all three black golems were identical and belonged to
a single set. He could sense that they were arrayed together into a
formation and so he naturally chose to go against the stone titan
instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him, rocky.”
Ning immediately sent a mental message over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. My talents lie in tying down foes.” Rocky’s palms
suddenly expanded dramatically in size as his stony body suddenly
began to flow like a liquid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! World God
Foxblaze exchanged blows with Rocky, the force of the collision
causing a few ripples to appear on the liquid-like surface of Rocky’s
body. However, Rocky himself didn’t take so much as a single step
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” World God
Foxblaze was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the three black
golems, they once more charged towards him and attacked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four mighty golems
surrounded and assaulted this solitary World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze
still refused to give up. Although blows were raining down upon him,
he had a set of Dao armor and a tough divine body. World Gods weren’t
easily killed, and he continued to do his best to find a way to
survive this assault. Alas, the three black golems moved together in
perfect unison, giving him no chance to flee whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give up!” Right at
this moment, Ning arrived. He struck out with Violetjewel, sending
that terrifying streak of bloody sword-light towards Foxblaze once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!” World God
Foxblaze truly felt despair now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The sword-blow
knocked him flying once more… and then, with a series of booms, two
of the black golems smashed him into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was a World God
who specialized in defense, he wouldn’t have been taken down so
quickly. He would’ve been able to keep fighting for a somewhat
longer period of time. Ji Ning, for example, had the Heartsword
stance that gave him perfect control over his defensive sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the Dao
of the Sword was an offensive Dao that had tremendous advantages in
close combat! Although World God Foxblaze used the scimitar, his
specialty lay in a Dao of the Wind. This gave him certain advantages
in speed and power in close combat, but once he lost the upper hand
he would quickly be defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Once
Foxblaze was knocked down to the ground, the four golems began to
rain a wild storm of blows upon his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he stood
there to one side, not taking part in this. The blow he had just
delivered was the final straw that had broken the camel’s back.
World God Foxblaze would no longer have any chance of turning the
tables on his attackers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed a
long rope to suddenly appear next to him. The rope agilely slithered
through the air like a serpent, quickly tying up the completely
beaten World God Foxblaze and rendering him securely and completely
incapacitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of utter despair
was in Foxblaze’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning turned
his head to glance backwards. The black gourd that had been spewing
endless streams of lightning quickly flew towards Ning, coming to a
halt within his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held the black
gourd with one hand as he stared downwards at the tied and bound
Foxblaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really…really…”
When Foxblaze saw the black gourd fly to Ning, he couldn’t help but
mumble to himself, “The gourd really does belong to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this
Foxblaze fellow was much harder to deal with than Foxbold,” Su
Youji said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He insisted on
setting off on a path of no return. He has no one to blame for his
death but himself,” Elder God Wilddog growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me. Spare me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Foxblaze was
completely trussed up. He stared at Ning. “Spare me and I’ll give
you all my treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot. Do you
really take us for a fool? After we kill you, all of your treasures
will be ours regardless.” Su Youji let out a cold laugh. Towards
outsiders, she remained as ill-tempered and explosive as ever before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I…” World God
Foxblaze stared wildly at Ning, then gritted his teeth. “I’m
willing to be your retainer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No!” World God
Foxblaze took a deep breath. “I’m willing to be your slave! Your
slave! I, World God Foxblaze, am willing to be your slave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji,
Elder God Wilddog, and Elder God Blacksun all turned to look at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My slave? You honor
me too much. I’m not interested, and so… it’s best you simply
die.” Ning lifted up his black gourd, then activated it with a
thought. A powerful sucking power suddenly emerged from it and was
applied to World God Foxblaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Foxblaze was instantly
sucked towards the gourd, shrinking as he flew towards the gourd’s
opening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No… you… can’t
possibly…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in a state of
utter disbelief. Someone actually refused to accept him, an exalted
World God, as a slave? A moment later, he was drawn into the
Pentabolt Gourd. A few moments after that a rope flew out from the
gourd, then Ning resealed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trapped within the
Pentabolt Gourd, Foxblaze would suffer perpetual attacks from those
five types of lightning. Sooner or later, his divine power would run
out and he would be ground into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why, Master? He was
a World God, after all.” Su Youji and the others looked curiously
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to kill
him, so I did.” Ning’s response was quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A World God? What of
it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t like people
with Foxblaze’s character. He’d feel uncomfortable having the man
around, and a mere elite World God wouldn’t be of much use to him
anyhow. Any of his four golems was comparable to Foxblaze in power,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for selling him off
into slavery? He wouldn’t be worth nearly as much as a golem.
Golems were absolutely loyal to their masters, after all. Foxblaze
would most likely go for just a hundred cubes of chaos nectar at
most, but the problem was that he knew how strong Ji Ning actually
was. For now, Ning wished to keep his true power a secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wouldn’t worry
about the information leaking after he became a World God, and
wouldn’t have minded selling Foxblaze off at that time… but who
knew how long that would take? And by then, would he care about a
petty hundred cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might as well kill
him. I feel more comfortable doing that.” High-level cultivators
had to follow their own hearts and their own paths to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At my current level
of power, killing elite World Gods still requires a bit of effort.”
Ning reflected on this recent fight. “Without the four golems
helping out, things probably wouldn’t be so easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the four
golems, he had been able to kill an elite World God in a fairly short
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wild Dog, Blacksun,
go back and get some rest. Await my orders,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” both Elder
Gods said respectfully, their eyes filled with blazing eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a show of utter
dominance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had almost
instantly slain a Chaos Immortal and a World God. The World God had
begged to be enslaved, but their master didn’t even want to bother
with enslaving him. This was true dominance! Their master truly was
far too powerful. How mighty would he become when he actually reached
the World level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After Rocky,
Elder God Wilddog, and Elder God Blacksun were all transported back
into the estate-world, Ning turned to look towards Su Youji. “Youji,
let’s get back to our hunt for that bugbeast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Su Youji
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Relying
on his attunement to the Mirrorsnow Painting, Ning quickly led Su
Youji towards the location of the second painting.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_31___Grove_of_Monoliths"></A>
Chapter 31 - Grove of Monoliths
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led Su Youji
forward, using his attunement to the painting to sense where they
should go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bugbeast had
already come to a halt, causing Ning to feel quite uneasy. Although
most bugbeasts were fairly dumb, World-level bugbeasts were both
powerful and rather clever. Since this one knew that Ning had a way
to track it, for it to come to a halt could only mean that it had
found a place it felt was very safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji flew
past one mountain peak after another, shrouded by mist. Every so
often they could thread their way past forests or deep gorges. They
advanced with great caution and deliberation, and as a result spent
nearly an hour before they reached their destination. The bugbeasts
had come to a halt, after all; it didn’t matter too much if they
were moving a bit slower than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be up
ahead.” Ning was standing atop a towering, jagged boulder as he
mentally conversed with the fiery-robed Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take it
slow,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the vanguard and
Su Youji was the rearguard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two began to move
even more slowly than before. Thanks to the mist which permeated this
region, Ning was only able to see to a distance of a few hundred
kilometers. As he slowly drew closer and closer to the destination,
he could sense a terrifyingly powerful aura suddenly sweep towards
them from afar. Both Ning and Su Youji blanched at the power of this
aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?”
Suddenly, Ning saw something up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few hundred
kilometers up ahead, there was a single giant monolith that was
roughly three hundred meters tall and surrounded by mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grove of
Monoliths?” Su Youji’s face tightened. “Master, this seems to
be the Grove of Monoliths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move a bit
closer and check it out,” Ning replied. His heart clenched as they
slowly moved closer and closer to the monolith. Soon, they were
roughly ten kilometers away from the first monolith and were able to
see a second monolith of similar size and shape that had been
embedded into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This second monolith
had a red-winged beast that lay coiled atop it which emanated an aura
of tremendous savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. They
continued to advance, keeping a careful distance from the creature.
One monolith after another entered their field of vision, each of
which was roughly three hundred meters tall. The monoliths had all
been planted deeply into the ground, and many of them had terrifying
bugbeasts that lay coiled on top of them. Other monoliths were
surrounded by magic treasures and weapons which had auras of
tremendous power. Most of them were Dao-level weapons or treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Su
Youji grew increasingly nervous. This was a terrifyingly dangerous
part of the Fog Sea, the ‘Grove of Monoliths’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.” Ning
finally gave the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two carefully,
quietly, and rapidly retreated from this location, only coming to a
halt after they entered a nearby copse of trees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually went
into hiding within the Grove of Monoliths.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is all the
fault of World God Foxblaze and Chaos Immortal Foxbold. They delayed
us at a critical moment! Otherwise, we probably would’ve been able
to catch up to that heavily injured bugbeast.” The Flamefairy
couldn’t help but feel quite upset by this. She knew exactly how
much her master needed that sword-ki painting, and it now seemed
evident that the painting would be unobtainable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t in a very
good mood right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had felt rather
exuberant after slaying World God Foxblaze and Chaos Immortal
Foxbold, as this was the first time he had personally slain a
World-level expert, and two of them at that! However, Ning now felt
rather resentful at all this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They ruined
everything!” Ning gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should my next plan of action be?” Ning began to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ten Thousand
Mountains was the outer region of this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fog Sea was part of
the inner region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fog Sea had many
dangerous areas within it, and the Grove of Monoliths was definitely
ranked as one of the deadliest locations. Based on the experiences of
the many cultivators who had adventured into it, this was a region
that took up roughly ten thousand kilometers of space, and within
this region there were many enormous monoliths that had been inserted
into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some unknown
reason, bugbeasts were highly attracted to these monoliths. Thus,
bugbeasts would often rest within the Grove of Monoliths, with dozens
of them nesting in this region at any given time. All of these
bugbeasts were World-level creatures. Bugbeasts were fairly
unintelligent and did not understand the mysteries of the Dao. They
had to rely on their physical strength and their innate gifts to
fight, and so most of them only had the power of ordinary World Gods!
A minority were comparable to elite World Gods and a tiny number of
them were comparable to master-class World Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, they did have one
advantage: they existed in overwhelmingly large numbers. The Grove of
Monoliths often had around a hundred World-level bugbeasts within it
at any given moment in time. There were simply too many of them! If
any cultivator dared to trespass within the Grove, that cultivator
would immediately suffer the attacks of every single bugbeast there!
As more time passed, bugbeasts from other areas would also hurry to
the Grove to reinforce their fellows, causing the situation to grow
increasingly dangerous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grove of Monoliths
was definitely a place of incredible danger. Only supreme World Gods
would be able to survive in that place, but if they were unlucky
enough to encounter particularly powerful bugbeasts they might still
perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grove of
Monoliths is too dangerous.” Su Youji looked at Ning. “Master,
according the information we acquired regarding the Allgod Estate,
only supreme World Gods have a chance of surviving a trip into the
Grove of Monoliths. If we go in there, we’d probably be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
“It’s true. We have no hope of surviving that place. I knew that
damned bugbeast would pick a troublesome place to hide.” Ning
continued to ponder on this matter but could find no solutions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The place was simply
too dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All bugbeasts had a
fetish for collecting magic treasures. Although they couldn’t use
them, they viewed those items as their spoils of combat. Thus, the
hundred-plus bugbeasts in the Grove of Monoliths had a
correspondingly enormous hoard of magic treasures of inestimable
value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, no one dared to
go and try to take the treasure from them. Even supreme World Gods
only stood a fairly small chance of surviving that place. Who would
dare to risk their lives in such a rash way?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to wait for my own breakthrough to the World level. Perhaps then I’ll
have a chance,” Ning mused. He was already comparable to a
master-class World God; after he actually broke through to the World
level, he would definitely become much more powerful than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for exactly how much
more powerful he could become, even Ning himself wasn’t sure. This
was because the main reason he was so powerful was because of the
azureflower region inside of him. It was currently of tremendous help
to him, but would it continue to be effective after he reached the
World level? There was no way for Ning to find out in advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave?” Su Youji
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. We have no
choice but to give up for now!” Ning turned his head to give the
distant Grove of Monoliths a final look. “The Grove of Monoliths
isn’t a place which I can challenge. Not now, at least. Let’s go
explore some other areas. Perhaps, after a period of time passes,
that bugbeast will voluntarily depart from the Grove.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Voluntarily leave the
Grove? Even Ning himself knew that he was just daydreaming. The
graymist creature had nearly lost its life. It probably would stay
hidden within the Grove for a long period of time before leaving. It
wouldn’t be surprising if it stayed there for at least a million
years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. Maybe
it’ll come out later,” Su Youji said supportively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than five months had passed since the two had slain Foxblaze and
Foxbold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the core region
of the Allgod Estate, the Castrum Divinitus itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering estate was
an utterly dazzling sight to behold, emanating an aura of light that
seemingly stretched off into infinity. Although the Allgod Estate
took up nearly half of this entire chaosworld, the Castrum Divinitus
itself was so high that it could be seen from the very ends of the
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an utterly
enormous castle that spanned trillions of kilometers! This was a
place which spelled doom for even Samsara Daolords! A place none
dared to enter rashly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re just one
step away. Just one step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the
towering castle was an enormous plaza, and before the plaza were a
flight of stairs. However, there were 108,000 steps to this flight of
stairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two squads of
cultivators were advancing up the stairs. One squad had four
World-level experts and was led by a small, skinny, blood-robed
youth. This skinny youth had blood-red eyebrows, and his eyes seemed
like a deep, bottomless sea of blood. Anyone who looked at him would
be seized by uncontrollable fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth
walked at the head of his squad, and behind him were three World Gods
with auras of tremendous power. These three World Gods all treated
the youth with tremendous respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fukai! Ahahaha. You
brought ten World-level servants in, but only two of them remain.”
The blood-robed youth let out an ear-piercing laugh. “I think you
should just surrender and commit suicide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surrender? To you?”
The leader of the other squad was a golden-robed youth, and behind
him were two World-level experts of tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed youth
laughed coldly as he cast the other youth a sidelong glance. “Arroyo,
you brought in ten as well but you only have three left. You aren’t
that much better off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still have one
more than you. One more servant means my chances are better,” the
blood-robed youth snickered. His bloodsea eyes were overflowing with
a desire to kill, and he didn’t disguise his intent at all as he
glared at the golden-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two squads
advanced simultaneously up the stairs, neither squad pausing to rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they finished the
108,000 steps and reached the very top of the stairs, arriving at the
great plaza.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both squads raised
their heads to stare at the enormous castle before them, a castle so
great that they could barely see the top of it clearly.

Chapter 32 - Bringing Disaster Upon Others
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering castle was
utterly, endlessly enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two squads held a
total of seven World-level experts, and they were like ants crawling
atop the surface of that utterly enormous plaza. The leaders of the
two squads, that blood-robed youth and that gold-robed youth, both
raised their heads to stare at the titanic gates to the towering
castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The front gates to the
Castrum Divinitus was just as vast and towering as the castle itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though they were
World Gods, they could just barely make out the outlines of the great
castle. The edges to the castle were so far away that they appeared
quite blurry to these World Gods. This was a testament to how truly
vast this castle was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Allgod truly
was a cultivator who was comparable to Eternal Emperors.” A blazing
look was in the eyes of the blood-robed youth. “Sooner or later,
I’ll become just as powerful as Daolord Allgod was. My name will
spread throughout the Endless Territories, just as his did. Countless
cultivators will tremble in fear when they hear my name. Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you still
daydreaming? Time to wake up.” The golden-robed youth in the other
squad smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You’ll be
nothing more than a stepping stone to me.” The blood-robed youth
glanced sideways at the golden-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what I can
sense from the workings of fate… you’ll die here while I will
survive.” The golden-robed youth’s voice held a strange cadence
to it as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You fool.” The
blood-robed youth laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they were chatting
with each other, drops of liquid suddenly began to manifest atop the
vast plaza. The drops of liquid were covered in flames, and they
slowly began to drawn together into a fiery figure. The flames began
to die away, revealing the figure’s form. This was a bald, muscular
man who had three eyes, the third eye in the middle of his forehead
glowing with golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Goldeye Golem.”
The golden-robed youth and the blood-robed youth blanched, hurriedly
suppressing their auras and beginning to act in a much more humble
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldeye Golem was
Daolord Allgod’s greatest creation and the most perfect
manifestation of his Dao of Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod was an
expert in both artificing and in golem-making. The Goldeye Golem was
the most powerful golem he had ever created, and Daolord Allgod had
infused it with certain restrictive spells that ensured that there
was no way any other cultivators would ever be able to take control
over it. In other words…the Goldeye Golem possessed freedom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It possessed tremendous
power and was comparable to a Daolord who had reached the verge of
the Daomerge! The Allgod Estate was under its control, as was the
many formations and protective spells inside of it. Even Samsara
Daolords who were themselves at the Verge would definitely die if
they tried to force their way through the estate… and this Goldeye
Golem was just one of the many defensive mechanisms which Daolord
Allgod had left behind in this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a golem that
could not be bound. It would forever stay within the Allgod Estate,
serving as its eternal guardian! This was the First Guardian and
Commander of the Castrum Divinitus, the core of the Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a long,
long time since a cultivator has come to the Castrum Divinitus.”
The bald, three-eyed man stared coldly at the two squads. “You were
able to overcome many dangers and make your way to the castle. Very
well done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allgod Estate was
divided into three regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outer region was
the Ten Thousand Mountains. The inner region was the Fog Sea. The
core region was the Castrum Divinitus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals generally stayed in the Ten Thousand Mountains,
as 90% of them would perish if they dared to enter the Fog Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World-level experts
generally stayed in the Fog Sea. Although some of them would die,
they still stood a decent chance of survival. However, if they dared
to travel on to the Castrum Divinitus it was almost guaranteed that
they would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords did not dare
to enter this place at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There were
originally twenty-two of you. For seven of you to survive and make it
to this place means that you are fairly strong for World-level
experts,” the three-eyed man evaluated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only one out of ten World-level cultivators would be able to survive
a journey to the Castrum Divinitus. Thus, people like Ning or World
God Dragonbinder wouldn’t even think about trying to travel all the
way to the core region. Such an attempt would be sheer suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me. What do you
desire?” The bald three-eyed man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gazes of the two
squad leaders lit up. The blood-robed youth and the gold-robed youth
had both risked their lives in order to acquire the same treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
the Eternal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
the Eternal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two simultaneously
said the exact same thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
the Eternal?” The bald three-eyed man frowned. It was clearly just
a golem, but it behaved just as an actual living being might.
Previously, there was a look of kindness in his gaze. Now, his words
and his bearing had turned markedly colder. “If you have come here
for the divine blood of the Eternal, you should know exactly where
that blood came from! My master spent endless years chasing after
Eternal Emperor Melobo. After dealing him a grievious injury, my
master was able to steal away a portion of his divine blood. After
refining it down to its purest essence, Master was able to produce
just a single drop of purified divine blood!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That drop of Eternal
blood is utterly priceless. It is one of the top ten treasures of the
Allgod Estate!” The bald three-eyed man swept the seven cultivators
with his gaze. “But since you have made it past all the dangerous
obstacles in your way… per Master’s orders, you are qualified to
be given one chance to acquire one of his legacy’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the more
valuable the legacy, the more difficult the trial.” The three-eyed
man continued, “I urge you to give up and instead choose an Eternal
weapon, a precious elixir, or even a hundred bugbeasts servants.
Those trials are all much easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only wish for the
Eternal blood,” the blood-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only thing I
desire is the Eternal blood,” the gold-robed youth agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
three-eyed man was rather irritated, but he couldn’t go against the
orders which his master had set down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well then.”
The three-eyed man’s voice was now ice-cold, and it grated against
the ears of the seven cultivators. “All seven of you desire the
divine blood of the Eternal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five
World-level experts all spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have made your
request, and your request is for the Eternal blood of Melobo!” The
three-eyed man nodded. “Very well then. You shall be given the most
difficult trial…the Twin Samsara Heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The
gold-robed youth and the blood-robed youth both had blazing, eager
looks in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who reached the
front gates of the Castrum Divinitus could make a request of the
Goldeye Golem. Daolord Allgod was quite benevolent towards weaker
cultivators. He slew any and all Daolords who attempted to enter his
estate, but any World-level experts who made it to the front gates
usually would not leave empty-handed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
experienced many life-threatening dangers in your quest to reach this
place. If you asked for any other treasures, even if you failed your
trials you wouldn’t be at risk of losing your lives,” the
three-eyed man said. “However, the trial of the Twin Samsara
Heavens is the most difficult trial possible. Many of you will die,
and it is possible that all seven of you will fail to acquire the
Eternal blood. By then, it will be too late to feel regret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t feel
regret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No regrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth
and the gold-robed youth both spoke out in unison. In their hearts,
they were actually beginning to curse at the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cut the crap, alright?
Hurry up and start!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” The
three-eyed man nodded. “The trial of the Twin Samsara Heavens
requires a total of ten World-level experts. Only seven of you are
present. Therefore…I will teleport three additional World-level
experts from various places throughout the Allgod Estate. They, too,
shall take part in the Twin Samsara Heavens alongside the seven of
you. They too shall have a chance to acquire the Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of both the
blood-robed youth and the gold-robed youth tightened… but then they
smiled coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would those ants
even dare to compete against us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they come, they
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both felt quite
confident in their abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…” The
three-eyed man nodded slowly. “I can sense four other World-level
experts within the Allgod Estate right now. I’ll teleport the three
closest ones here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You wanted to
resist me?” World God Dragonbinder was seated atop a boulder, a
somewhat excited look in his eyes as he stared at a flying needle
which he had just recently acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, space around
him began to twist and distort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this-…”
Dragonbinder’s face twisted. He had never heard of something like
this happening before, of a person tripping a formation despite
sitting there and not even moving. Space around him formed into a
spatial whirlpool which quickly drew Dragonbinder into its folds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps I’ll have
a chance of succeeding once I become a master-class World-level
expert.” A green-haired man dressed in long pink robes and whose
narrow eyes were filled with foxlike cunning was staring at a palace
in front of him. He had two females behind him, both Ancestral
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I have to reach
the level of full mastery first. If I still fail, then I’ll simply
accept my death within this Fog Sea.” A look of resolve was in the
pink-robed man’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space twisted around
him as well as that spatial vortex appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
The pink-robed man was astonished. He had spent more than a thousand
years in the Fog Sea but had never encountered a situation like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” His two
maids were shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The whirlpool of
twisted space completely enveloped him as well as both of his maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of them
disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, you need to
spend some time thinking about how to infuse your insights regarding
the Dao of Fire into your combat tactics.” Ning was by Su Youji’s
side, watching as she filled the air around her with countless curved
scimitars. These were the treasures left behind by Chaos Immortal
Foxbold, and they actually a very good fit for the Flamefairy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ning
would help Su Youji acquire even better weapons after they left the
Allgod Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spatial ripples began
to appear in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
Ning and the Flamefairy were both shocked. The spatial ripples
twisted into a vortex which quickly encompassed the two of them,
giving them no chance to hide or to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and the
Flamefairy disappeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth,
the gold-robed youth, and the five World-level retainers were all
standing before the great plaza. As for the three-eyed man, he stood
at the very front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, a
series of spatial ripples began to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of figures
began to appear from within the spatial ripples. The three groups
consisted of the pink-robed man and his two maids, World God
Dragonbinder, and Ji Ning and Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were roped in?” The blood-robed youth laughed.
“Why’d you even bring them? My servants are all World-level
experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For them to come
means death.” The gold-robed youth laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the two wanted
nothing more than to kill each other, that was because they viewed
each other as dangerous opponents. As for other World-level experts?
They truly held very little respect for the vast majority of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are we here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators who had
just been forcibly dragged to this place all stared around in a
bewildered fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Dragonbinder.” When Ning saw Dragonbinder, he
couldn’t help but call out to him mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning.
Flamefairy.” When World God Dragonbinder saw Ning and Su Youji
appear, he was also delighted and hurriedly messaged both of them.
They could all sense that something strange was happening and so
confined their conversation to the mental realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. All of you
were quite lucky. The seven of us risked our lives and nearly died to
make it to this place, but you were lucky enough to be teleported
straight here.” The blood-robed youth laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wrong. They aren’t
lucky. They are unlucky as all hell… because they are going to die
very soon,” the gold-robed youth said calmly.

Chapter 33 - The Samsara Grinders
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Flamefairy Su
Youji, World God Dragonbinder, and the rest of the cultivators who
had been teleported here glanced cautiously at their new
surroundings. They heard the words of both the blood-robed youth and
the gold-robed youth, and it led them to come to a certain
conclusion. This conclusion was simply so inconceivable that it
caused all of them to feel shock and awe in their hearts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we standing
before the Castrum Divinitus?” Ning raised his head to stare at the
infinitely vast castle before him. “According to the information I
purchased, one has to experience countless dangers in order to make
it to the doorstep of the Castrum Divinitus, the coremost region of
the entire Allgod Estate. It is said that death is virtually assured
for anyone who tries to make this journey! Can it be that these seven
World Gods have all successfully made it here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven had survived the
journey through the Allgod Estate to this place. How many had
originally been in those two squads? According to the accepted odds
of only one in ten surviving, could it be that dozens of them had
made the attempt? Were there really this many suicidal World Gods in
the world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Welcome, our three
newcomers.” The three-eyed man’s voice rang out as he glanced at
the three new World-level experts. Everyone on the plaza fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I forcibly
teleported all of you here, and I imagine you are rather confused,”
the three-eyed man said. “Although being teleported here can be
described as a devastating disaster, it can also be described as a
tremendous opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
looked at the bald three-eyed man. The three-eyed man, simply
standing there, radiated a faint aura of absolute transcendent power.
Although he was clearly suppressing his aura, Ning and the others
could all tell that this man could probably wipe them all out with a
single gentle breath! And indeed, their senses were accurate. This
three-eyed man, the Goldeye Golem, was the First Guardian of the
Castrum Divinitus. He was every bit as powerful as Daolord Solesky
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you,
and the seven of you!” The three-eyed man pointed towards the
cultivators on both sides, and all of them listened obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must take part
in the trial of the Twin Samsara Heavens,” the three-eyed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” World God
Dragonbinder couldn’t help but speak out. “Why must we experience
this trial? Must we take part in it? Also… you spoke of a
‘tremendous opportunity’. What are you speaking of?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must take part,”
the three-eyed man replied calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragonbinder couldn’t
help but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t a fool. He
could tell that this Twin Samsara Heavens trial had to be an
incredibly dangerous one. Even though he was a disciple of the
Badlands Court, he had never even heard of the Castrum Divinitus
forcibly teleporting World-level experts to this location to take
part in any trials. In addition, the other group of seven World Gods
gave him a sense of enormous danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, either of the
two squads in that group could effortlessly kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want this
‘tremendous opportunity’. All he wanted to do was get out of
here! But alas, there was no way out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of them
experienced countless dangers on their journey, and many of their
comrades died on the way to this place.” The three-eyed man pointed
towards the two squads as he explained to Ning and the others. “They
were allowed to make certain requests of me, and if they requested
bugbeasts, golems, high-level techniques, or other similar items they
would’ve been given fairly simple trials.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, they only
desired one thing… the divine blood of the Eternal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
Eternal Emperor Melobo.” A dangerous tone could be heard in the
three-eyed man’s voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart clenched
when he heard this. Emperor Melobo?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wasn’t that the
Eternal Emperor which Daolord Allgod had wished to kill for so many
years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine blood of
the Eternal is of inestimable value.” The three-eyed man swept Ning
and the others with his gaze. “Its value vastly surpasses the value
of any items you are familiar with such as Pseudo Samsara Pills or
Eternal weapons! It is one of the ten most valuable items in the
entire Castrum Divinitus. As for its purposes… if one of you is
able to obtain it, I’ll tell you then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth
had a look in his eyes that could only be described as ‘berserk’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the gold-robed
youth was more sedate, one could also see the flames of excitement
burning deep within his icy cold gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blood of the
Eternal? What’s that?” World God Dragonbinder and the pink-robed
man were both quite puzzled. They had never even heard of such a
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You fools.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed youth
and the gold-robed youth exchanged a glance, completely disdainful of
the newcomers who had just appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man
waved his hand. Suddenly, an enormous black and white millstone and
grindstone appeared the air above the great plaza. The two giant
stones were a hundred kilometers in size, and they slowly descended
downwards before alighting on the plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Samsara
Grinders.” The three-eyed man pointed at the enormous grinder. “I
will split the ten of you into five pairs! Each pair will take turns
battling atop the Samsara Grinders, and your opponents shall be the
many warriors who will appear and attack you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In short, you will
only achieve victory when your opponent and any forces he controls
all perish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If both you and your
opponent perish at the same time, you can only blame your own poor
luck.” The three-eyed man continued, “As for the surviving
cultivators, they will each blessed with a small bit of fortune. The
cultivator whose performance was the best will have a chance of
acquiring the divine blood of the Eternal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chance?” The
blood-robed youth and the gold-robed youth both spoke out at the same
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to
acquire the Eternal blood, then do your best to kill. Kill the
warriors on the Samsara Grinders and kill your foe! The more you
kill, the more power you reveal, the greater the chances that you
will acquire the Eternal blood.” The three-eyed man said calmly,
“You have to at least meet my minimum expectations. Otherwise, none
of you should even think about acquiring the Eternal blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The breaths of the two
youths turned ragged. They had paid an enormous price to get here!
But alas, they had no other options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first pair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald three-eyed man
swept his gaze across the ten World-level experts. He first pointed
towards the World God standing behind the blood-robed youth. This
World God actually had bone armor growing out of his upper back and
protecting his chest. Spikes grew out from his elbows and knees, and
his face was covered with a mask of bone which covered everything but
his eyes and his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man
pointed at the World God and said, “You!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And… you!” The
three-eyed man then pointed towards the pink-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” World God
Boneplate looked at the blood-robed youth respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just kill him as
fast as you can,” the blood-robed youth instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” World God
Boneplate said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pink-robed man
frowned as he carefully scrutinized his opponent in the Samsara
Grinders. “Not good. I’ve never even seen this man before. He
probably isn’t a World God of the Badlands Territory. I sense
tremendous danger from this man! Still, since he’s willing to be
the blood-robed youth’s servant, he probably shouldn’t be too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pink-robed man
murmured softly to himself, “Looks like I’ll have to go all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
listen up! Each of you will only be permitted to use nine Elder Gods
or Ancestral Immortals at most! You can at most use a total of nine
bugbeasts! You are also limited to no more than nine golems!
Furthermore, none of your World-level servants are permitted to take
part!” The three-eyed man finished his instructions, then gave the
final commands. “Now, go up onto the Samsara Grinders. Once I give
the order, you can begin your attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” World God
Boneplate said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit. I can’t use
my thousand-man Elder God Formation!” The pink-robed man’s face
turned pale. That formation was one of his killer trump cards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Boneplate and
the pink-robed man both flew atop the enormous black-white bedstone,
rapidly shrinking to become ant-sized as they landed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Samsara Grinders
contains a dimension of its own,” World God Dragonbinder sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-white
bedstone and millstone were both covered with countless marvelous
runes and patterns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Boneplate
stood there, staring at his distant foe. He said aloud, “Chaos
Immortal Flygrace. I recognize you. You have the power of an elite
World-level expert.” His voice boomed with power and strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’ve never
heard of you before,” the pink-robed Chaos Immortal Flygrace
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous Samsara
Grinders began to tremble as the countless runes covering its surface
began to emit light. The light quickly began to swirl together and
condense into human-shaped warriors dressed in golden armor. There
had to be thousands of those golden warriors, and every single one of
them had the aura of a World-level expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! How can there
be this many golden warriors?” Everyone watching this was shocked,
including the two combatants on the Samsara Grinders as well as
everyone watching from below. Their faces all turned pale!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The auras generated by
these golden warriors indicated that all of them had reached the
World level of power. Even if they were merely at the threshold,
there were thousands of them! This was utterly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin, then.” The
three-eyed man gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousands of golden
warriors transformed into streaks of light, moving at the speed of
light as they charged towards the pink-robed man and World God
Boneplate.

Chapter 34 - The Silkmaid Race
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
pink-robed Chaos Immortal Flygrace had an ugly look on his face. He
immediately willed the area around him to become filled with
silvery-white shuttles. After they appeared, he furiously poured all
of his Immortal energy into them, unleashing the power of the seals
hidden within this set of Dao weapons. Instantly, the nine
silvery-white shuttles began to transform and blur, first dividing
into a total of eighty-one shuttles, then dividing into 729 shuttles,
then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, more than ten
thousand flying shuttles had appeared in the area around Chaos
Immortal Flygrace, and they clustered around him in a dense array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden warriors
bellowed with rage. Some of them wielded warblades, some wielded
spears, some wielded gourds, some wielded ropes, and some wielded
whips. They all surged forward en masse as they wildly charged
towards their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! These
golden warriors quickly entered into combat against Chaos Immortal
Flygrace. The thousands of flying shuttles around him all transformed
into streaks of light as they furiously plunged down upon the
gold-armored warriors. Due to the limitations of space, only a
hundred golden warriors could attack him at the same time. Thus,
there were over a hundred shuttles striking against every single
golden warrior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Massive explosions
could be heard ringing out nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden warriors had
no fear of death and continued to charge forwards fearlessly. Some
died due to their injuries, but more of their fellows would charge
forward to take their spots. The runes of the Samsara Grinders
committed to emit that dazzling light, causing a steady stream of
golden warriors to continue to be born. Slowly, the total number of
golden warriors atop the Samsara Grinders began to increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. I’m
already using my most powerful area attack technique, and I’m using
up my Immortal energy at an incredible rate. Despite that, I’m just
barely able to hold on.” Chaos Immortal Flygrace was quickly forced
into shrinking his defensive perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden warriors
charged forward in an endless flood, fearing neither injury nor
death. Quite a few of the silvery-white shuttles actually vanished,
as there were only nine real ones to begin with. The rest were all
condensed out of Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. I can’t
hang on for much longer.” Chaos Immortal Flygrace spared a moment
to glance at his distant opponent, wanting to see how his opponent
was fairing. The distant World God Boneplate was slaughtering all of
the golden warriors around him with incomparable valor. More and more
golden warriors had appeared around him as well, and they had started
to use teamwork, with some using ropes to slow him down and others
using spears to strike at him from afar. World God Boneplate was
starting to look a bit haggard, and yet he was still able to hold his
own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A master-class World
God?” Chaos Immortal Flygrace’s face changed. When he saw World
God Boneplate continue to dispatch the golden warriors with
comparative ease, Chaos Immortal Flygrace immediately understood just
how powerful his foe was. In addition, his foe had clearly slain more
of the golden warriors than he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More and more of the
shuttles surrounding Chaos Immortal Flygrace began to disappear
before reforming. His defensive perimeter was continuing to shrink as
the golden warriors began to grow increasingly frenzied in their
attacks. Many of them were starting to strike from afar by hurling
their spears, putting even more pressure on Chaos Immortal Flygrace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no… am I going
to just die here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can it end like
this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to make it
back. I paid such an enormous price and abandoned all my pride. I
slew my only friend in order to be able to acquire this Lesser
Thousand Elder Gods Formation. I was going to go back once I reached
the level of full mastery! How can I die here…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden warriors
were now able to move to within thirty meters of him, and more and
more of them were surging in his direction. A short while later,
Chaos Immortal Flygrace was completely smashed apart and slain by the
golden warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, World God
Dragonbinder, and Su Youji watched all this happen from afar. Rather
unpleasant looks could be seen on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaos Immortal
Flygrace had quite a good reputation, actually.” World God
Dragonbinder sighed. “Him and Chaos Immortal Winterbowl were good
friends and known as the ‘Two Immortals Who Fly in Winter’. Chaos
Immortal Winterbowl died just a short while ago, and now Chaos
Immortal Flygrace has died as well. Alas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Samsara
Grinders truly is dangerous.” Su Youji was quite nervous. “Those
golden warriors don’t look that tough, but there are simply far too
many of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That World God
covered in bony armor is able to slay a warrior with each strike of
his palms. I can sense that these warriors have merely reached the
threshold of the World level of power.” Ning nodded. “The problem
is that there are too many of them, and they are completely
fearless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fighting enemies who
had no fear of death at all was a completely different experience
from fighting normal enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have poor
techniques. In fact, you can say that they have no techniques at
all.” World God Dragonbinder nodded. “However, they are extremely
strong. See that? When dozens of them toss their spears at the same
time, even that bone-armored World God is suffering some injuries
when he blocks them head on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although this
Samsara Grinders supposedly is meant for the two combatants to duel
each other, there’s actually no point to it. The gold-armored
warriors alone are enough of a challenge!” Ning slowly shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Most likely,
only someone with the power of a supreme World God would be capable
of bursting past the encirclement of the golden warriors,” World
God Dragonbinder agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
many golden warriors on the battlefield, only so many could attack
you at any given moment in time. Thankfully, they didn’t have any
combination formations to use either. Thus, if you were strong enough
you might stand a chance of bursting past their many attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, none
of us have that level of power.” World God Dragonbinder shook his
head as he looked at Ning and Su Youji. “Youji, you just made your
breakthrough a short while ago. You are too weak. It will be very
dangerous for you once it is your turn to enter the Grinder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he saw it, Ji Ning
was merely an Elder God while Su Youji was just a newly ascended
Chaos Immortal. The two of them were far too weak. Even an elite
World-level expert like Chaos Immortal Flygrace had been overwhelmed
and mobbed by those many golden warriors. How could Ji Ning and Su
Youji possibly survive? World God Dragonbinder was very worried about
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Chaos Immortal
Flygrace let out a final despairing cry, all of the golden warriors
atop the enormous Samsara Grinders came to a halt. Moments later,
their bodies began to break apart and dissipate into light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the only one
remaining was World God Boneplate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first of the
five matches has ended.” The three-eyed man waved his hand spoke
out in a frosty voice. His fiery hand dramatically increased in size,
seized World God Boneplate by the shoulder, then roughly tossed him
towards the direction of the blood-robed youth. “Since it’s over,
why the hell are you still taking up space on the Grinder?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of rage was in
World God Boneplate’s eyes, but he quickly suppressed it and
instead returned obediently to the blood-robed youth’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.” The
blood-robed youth glanced sideways at his slave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
World God Boneplate revealed a look of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second match…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man
swept the remaining combatants with his gaze, then pointed towards a
World God standing behind the gold-robed youth. This was a hideously
ugly old hag who had sharp, claw-like fingers. A dull red light could
be seen flickering deep within her eyes, and she emanated an aura of
extreme weirdness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” The bald
three-eyed man pointed towards the ugly old hag as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And… you!” The
three-eyed man pointed towards World God Dragonbinder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You already know the
rules. Up you go!” The three-eyed man ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ugly old hag gave
World God Dragonbinder a rather serious look. The gold-robed youth by
her side instructed, “Be careful. This is World God Dragonbinder, a
disciple of the Badlands Court. He definitely is far more powerful
than that Chaos Immortal Flygrace was. Don’t embarrass me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
master.” The ugly old hag nodded then immediately flew towards the
enormous Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, senior
apprentice-brother Dragonbinder,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Dragonbinder, I don’t recognize any of these cultivators. They must
be from other territories, and I can sense that they came with ill
intentions. That master-class World God who fought just now was
merely a servant; this one is probably a master-class World-level
expert as well,” Su Youji said with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…” World God
Dragonbinder nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that a critical
moment had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
flew towards the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
and the hideous old hag stared at each other from afar from their
positions at the opposite ends of the Samsara Grinders. The runes
covering the enormous Grinder began to radiate light that quickly
coalesced into those golden warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God
Dragonbinder. I’ve heard of your prowess and your might… but
today, you shall die by my hands. Listen up! You can call me
‘Silkwater’. Don’t die without even knowing who you died to!”
The ugly old hag began to grow in size as she spoke, her lower body
transforming into the body of a giant scorpion. As for her upper
body, it transformed into the form of a nude woman of surpassing
charm whose face was every bit as beautiful as Su Youji’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this, World
God Dragonbinder’s face tightened. “A Silkmaid?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Silkmaid?”
Ning’s face tightened as well. Before leaving, Daolord Solesky had
given him information regarding many of the mysteries and secrets of
the various territories around them. One bit of information pertained
to a race known as ‘Silkmaids’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who the hell are
these people? How is it that they have master-class World Gods and
Silkmaid experts serving as their slaves?” Ning turned to stare at
the distant gold-robed youth and blood-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t die, senior
apprentice-brother Dragonbinder. You have to stay alive.” Ning
wasn’t even thinking about his own safety right now. All of his
attention was focused on World God Dragonbinder.

Chapter 35 - Dao-Seals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless primordial
chaos was filled with endless mysteries. Even the exalted Eternal
Emperors, figures who would exist for all eternity for and whose
every word carried the force of law, would never dare to claim that
they understood all of its secrets. The primordial chaos held certain
special types of lifeforms, one of which Ji Ning had encountered in
the Three Realms. Back then, Ning had encountered the Waterian
servant of the Elder God known as Godfiend Witherspike. Although
Waterians were considered alien Outsiders to the Three Realms, they
were actually quite common in the Endless Territories and not worthy
of special mention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Silkmaid race,
however, was different. They were much rarer and much more
mysterious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They existed only in
small numbers, and all of them were female. They had to copulate with
males belonging to other species in order to give birth to new
Silkmaids, and their children would always be female! Despite being
few in number, they were extoradinarily powerful because they were
born with tremendous innate skill in illusions and also were very
skilled in close combat. A Silkmaid who reached the World level would
be an absolute nightmare for other World-level experts to face,
because anyone trapped in one of their illusions would find
themselves easy prey for the Silkmaids in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us begin,” the
three-eyed man ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of golden
warriors once more began to manifest atop the Samsara Grinders. With
a loud howl, the golden warriors all transformed into streaks of
light as they threw themselves towards World God Dragonbinder and
World Goddess Silkwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two azure golems
suddenly appeared next to World God Dragonbinder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The two
azure golems took up defensive positions around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block any foes who
attempt to attack me. Don’t let them get too close,” World God
Dragonbinder sent mentally to them. At the same time, he took out a
Dao-seal that looked like a dried yellow leaf. The seal was covered
in many wriggly divine runes and emanated an aura of mystery and
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go all out.”
World God Dragonbinder felt a tinge of heartache. This was a treasure
which he had saved to keep himself alive in a desperate situation.
However, upon learning that his opponent was a Silkmaid and upon
seeing all those golden warriors charge towards him, he could no
longer afford to be stingy with his treasures. Staying alive was what
mattered the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As World God
Dragonbinder poured his Immortal energy into the Dao-seal, the dried
leaf-like seal instantly disintegrated into countless divine runes.
These runes intersected with each other like countless thin strands
of silk, forming a golden set of armor over Dragonbinder’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SHKREE!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The half-scorpion,
half-female World God Silkwater let out an ear-piercing shriek. The
sound instantly drove its way into the ears of the distant World God
Dragonbinder, the strange cadence delving deep into his mind and
causing him to instantly lose his mental connection to the outside
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He realized that he had
suddenly been transformed into an ordinary mortal. He was in the
middle of a lake, and there were many beautiful women dressed in just
swathes of gauze who were slowly moving closer and closer to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Illusions? BREAK!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he seemed like
he was just an ordinary mortal, his suddenly explosive roar was
filled with his heartforce and the power of his mighty will. The roar
caused the illusory world to instantly break apart and quickly
dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
regained his faculties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large number of
golden warriors had drawn close to him and were charging straight
towards him. The two golems he had were doing their best to defend,
but there were simply too many of them. By now, two of them had
already reached Dragonbinder himself and were in the process of
launching an attack against him. However, the golden leather armor
covering his body just rippled slightly, easily defending against
this attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” World God
Dragonbinder stabbed out with his claw-like hands, piercing directly
through the heads of those two golden warriors. Boom! Boom! Both
golden warriors died instantaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
illusion. It managed to trap even me within its world for a period of
time.” World God Dragonbinder was shocked. My heartforce has
reached the fourth stage, and I have a secret art which Master taught
met, yet I was still unable to defend against it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had almost
instantly defeated the technique, battles between World-level experts
could start and finish in a single instant. That brief moment when he
had been trapped by the illusion was quite possibly enough to spell
doom in battle. However, weaker illusions wouldn’t have been able
to drag him into that illusory world, thanks to his powerful
heartforce and his soul technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God
Dragonbinder, die!” The Silkmaid battling against the other golden
warriors off in the distance let out repeated screeches, each screech
causing Dragonbinder a certain amount of trouble. He’d often come
to a halt mid-strike, giving those golden warriors a chance to land
attacks against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his two golems
stayed close to him and defended him in close combat, it was
impossible for them to prevent every single golden warrior from
reaching him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciples of
Daolord Badlands truly are difficult to deal with.” The gold-robed
youth’s face tightened slightly. “So he actually had a seal of
such tremendous power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fukai, aren’t you
supposed to be very talented in the art of Dao-seals? The Dao-seal
which World God Dragonbinder used just now was pretty powerful,
right? When those golden warriors manage to land attacks against him,
the Dao-talisman seems to almost completely nullify and ignore those
attacks.” The blood-robed youth snickered. “It seems your
Silkmaid is about to lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a limit to
how much power any Dao-seal can have. Once its power is used up,
he’ll die.” The gold-robed youth ground his teeth. He had paid a
staggering sum of money in order to purchase this World Goddess of
the Silkmaid race to be his slave. The thing was, she hadn’t
actually reached the level of full mastery as a World Goddess. Even
so, thanks to her innate talents and some special abilities even
actual master-class World Gods found it difficult to fight against
her. The gold-robed youth had done everything he could to help her
grow and to help strengthen her, but his quest to find the Eternal
blood was simply too important. He was willing to risk even his own
life to succeed in this question. Naturally, he had brought his
Silkmaid to join him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
him to actually have such a powerful Dao-seal. Thus far, more than
twenty golden warriors have landed attacks against him, but the power
of the Dao-seal hasn’t even begun to dim.” The gold-robed youth
secretly began to worry. “This Dao-seal has to be worth more than
two hundred cubes of chaos nectar, and it can only be used a single
time. I’m amazed he was willing to spend that much money.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, he let
out a sigh of relief. “So senior apprentice-brother Dragonbinder
actually had such a powerful Dao-seal on him. He’s safe now.
Still…I’m amazed he was willing to spend that much money on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao-seals were very
powerful, but the problem was that they were single-use items! Then
again, their advantage lay in the fact that they generally didn’t
have strict usage requirements. All you needed to do was to fill the
seal with your Immortal energy and its power would be fully
unleashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
Dao-seal which Dragonbinder had just used was comparable to a Samsara
Daolord’s defensive technique. Its energy was being depleted
nonstop, and when the energy ran out the golden leather armor would
disappear, but prior to that happening Dragonbinder was in a position
of absolute security.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No! Damn…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although World Goddess
Silkwater did her best to battle against her many foes, the golden
warriors continued to swarm her without pause. She let out repeated
screeches, causing World God Dragonbinder to be briefly trapped
within that illusory world, but Dragonbinder had both the golems
protecting him as well as the Dao-seal. By now, the golden leather
armor over his body had dimmed just slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silkwater, however, was
close to the end of her rope. These golden warriors attacking her
weren’t actual living creatures, and as such they were able to
completely ignore her illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” World
Goddess Silkwater cast a final glance to the gold-robed youth
standing outside the Samsara Grinders, a look of apology and longing
in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Silkmaid
retainer was absolutely loyal to her master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Go.” The
gold-robed youth felt tremendous sorrow in his heart as well.
Silkmaids were rarely used to fight on the front lines in such a
manner. During the previous battles, World Goddess Silkwater had
primarily been responsible for casting illusions from the back lines
while the other World Gods attacked furiously from the front lines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can get the
divine blood of the Eternal, all of this will have been worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I cannot… then
the only thing awaiting me shall be death as well.” The gold-robed
youth shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaah!” An
ear-splitting scream rang out as World Goddess Silkwater cast her
final illusion… and then she was completely tied up by the ropes of
the golden warriors. A golden warrior holding a flask drew Silkwater
into the flask, then ground her apart into dust. Just like that,
World Goddess Silkwater died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second match has
concluded.” The bald three-eyed man’s voice rang out once more.
World God Dragonbinder quickly put away his two golems then hurriedly
flew off of the Samsara Grinders. He was worried that if he moved too
slowly, he would also be physically tossed off the stage just as the
previous winner had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations, big
brother Dragonbinder,” Flamefairy Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragonbinder’s body
was still covered with a suit of faintly glowing golden leather
armor. He shook his head. “I was just lucky. That Silkmaid wasn’t
that strong. If she had actually reached the level of full mastery as
a World God, she would’ve been able to withstand the attacks of
those golden warriors for an extremely long period of time. My
Dao-seal would’ve been used up and I would’ve been not long for
this world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji both
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. Silkmaids possessed terrifying powers of illusions. One had
to have strong heartforce, a strong soul, and certain secret arts to
be able to withstand their illusions. Ning was still at the fourth
stage of heartforce and as such he was probably a bit too weak. Alas,
upgrading heartforce was simply too difficult. There were many
World-level experts who possessed only limited talent for heartforce,
because heartforce was a completely different path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivation was
primarily divided amongst Ki Refiners, Fiendgod Body Refiners, and
Heartforce Cultivators. Thus far, Ning had yet to encounter a single
World-level expert who was a Heartforce Cultivator! One could imagine
how rare they truly were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, how should
we deal with them when it is our turn?” The Flamefairy was a bit
worried.
</P>

Chapter 36 - Ji Ning Enters the Fray
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two squads are
too mysterious. Based on how they address each other, it would appear
as though the blood-robed youth and the gold-robed youth are the
leaders while the others are all servants or slaves! That
bone-armored World God was a master-class World God while World
Goddess Silkwater was of the ‘Silkmaid’ race, according to what
big brother Dragonbinder said. Even big brother Dragonbinder was
repeatedly drawn into her illusions. Given how powerful those two
were, the rest can’t be weak either.” Su Youji sent worriedly,
“And what worries me most is the possibility that we’ll encounter
one of the leaders on the Samsara Grinders. They have to be even more
dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ji Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji didn’t fully
comprehend how valuable Silkmaids were, but Ning himself did. If the
gold-robed youth truly had purchased a Silkmaid who was a World
Goddess, he had to have a staggering amount of wealth! A Silkmaid
World Goddess was worth more than a thousand cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if the Silkmaid
World Goddess had willingly chose to serve the gold-robed youth…
that just made him even more terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When it is our turn,
follow the plan I set out earlier,” Ning sent. “Given our level
of strength, we should be able to hold off those golden warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald three-eyed man
swept the remaining contestants with his gaze, then said, “The
third match will be… hm. You!” He pointed directly towards Su
Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And… you!” He
pointed at the skinny, viper-like man who was standing behind the
blood-robed youth, a man who emanated an aura of insidious cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior!” The
blood-robed youth’s face tightened as he hurriedly said, “Senior,
I feel as though your actions are unfair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Senior, your
actions truly are a bit unfair,” the gold-robed youth agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and Su Youji
were puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What was this all
about?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfair?” The
three-eyed man looked at the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We had to experience
countless dangers in order to reach this place, and I imagine you
know exactly how strong the seven of us are,” the blood-robed youth
said. “But the three World Gods you just chose were the three
weakest ones under our command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
gold-robed youth agreed. “Of the seven of us, World Goddess
Silkwater could be considered the equivalent of a master-class World
God, thanks to her illusory prowess. Thus, all three of them were
roughly comparable to master-class World Gods. However, the rest of
us are all supreme World Gods! You sent our three weakest followers
to compete against the three newcomers. It is clear that you intend
to have the four of us, the strongest four, to battle each other.
This isn’t really fair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are acting in a
rather prejudiced manner, senior.” The blood-robed youth was rather
irritated as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had a total of
seven cultivators split between their two teams. Three of them were
roughly on par with master-class World Gods while the other four had
the power of supreme World Gods. The First Guardian of the Castrum
Divinitus had arranged for the three World-level experts he had
forcibly teleported to this location to battle against the three
weakest members of the original seven. Clearly, he was acting in a
biased manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfair?” The
three-eyed man said coldly, “I forcibly teleported the three of
them here and forced them to accept a potentially deadly trial. Do
you think that was fair for them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And her!” The
three-eyed man pointed at Su Youji. “She broke through to become a
Chaos Immortal just a few short months ago, right here in the Allgod
Estate. We’re having a newly ascended Chaos Immortal compete
against a master-class World God. You tell me, is that fair?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man
swept the gold-robed youth and the blood-robed youth with a cold
gaze. “Or are you telling me that we should have her, a brand new
Chaos Immortal, battle against one of you four supreme World Gods?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly fell
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, both of them
knew exactly how strong Su Youji was. Before coming to the Badlands
Territory, they had collected a significant amount of intelligence
and information regarding all the World-level experts, Elder Gods,
and Ancestral Immortals who lived in this territory. They had both
long ago reviewed the information pertaining to Su Youji the
Flamefairy. Although they weren’t sure when she had made her
breakthrough, it was definitely within the past thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t even
have the balls to compete against others on the same level of power
as you, yet you dream of acquiring the divine blood of the Eternal?”
The three-eyed man snorted, a hint of a mockery on his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please give
us some guidance. What must we accomplish on the Samsara Grinders in
order to acquire the Eternal blood?” The blood-robed youth, Arroyo,
asked respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-robed youth,
Fukai, looked at the three-eyed man as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Personally kill your
opponent. Quickly.” The three-eyed man said calmly, “Enough.
Hurry up and get onto the Samsara Grinders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hear that, Darkfall?
She broke through to become a Chaos Immortal just a few months ago.
Kill her as fast as you can,” the blood-robed youth instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
tall, skinny, insidious man replied. Swish! He left behind a blur in
the air as he moved to stand atop the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
speed.” The faces of both Ning and Su Youji tightened when they saw
this. Their opponent was clearly so fast that not even Ning using the
Thunderlight Wings was a match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji both
flew up onto the Samsara Grinders. World God Dragonbinder wanted to
stop Ning but he wasn’t able to do so in time. His face turned pale
and he felt misery in his heart. “Brother Ji Ning, why the hell did
you go up there? It doesn’t matter if the Elder Gods or Ancestral
Immortals don’t take part.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine runes
covering the Samsara Grinders had already begun to glow with
countless streams of light, resulting in the appearance of the golden
warriors .
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, slender,
insidious man stood far away from Ning and Youji. He was dressed in
black robes, and he stared at them as he said in a cold voice,
“Flamefairy Su Youji. I’ve heard of you, but I didn’t expect
for you to have broken through to become a Chaos Immortal. I urge you
to put away that Elder God of yours. For him to take part in this
competition is suicide. Oh. I forgot to tell you my name. I am World
God Darkfall. Now, when you die, you’ll at least know the name of
the person who killed you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall
stood there, emanating an aura of absolute confidence. If he couldn’t
even kill a newly ascended Chaos Immortal, even he himself would feel
that he was a joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
mentally messaged Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow the plan,”
Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A master-class World
God? This would be the toughest foe he had ever faced. Although he
had encountered God Emperor Blacklotus who was even more powerful,
Ning hadn’t been the one to actually face him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man gave
the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless golden
warriors were driven into a frenzy as they transformed into streaks
of light that shot towards the two sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Ning
willed three golems to suddenly appear by his side. Two were black
golems while the third was Rocky the stone titan. The Flamefairy also
brought out her own black golem and took personal control of it upon
entering it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black golems
formed a triangle that surrounded Ning and Rocky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She actually had
four golems?” The blood-robed youth’s face tightened slightly
when he saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She actually had
four golems, Arroyo. It seems this won’t be as easy as you thought
it would be.” The gold-robed youth spoke in quite a relaxed manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. So what if she
has four? Just watch and see.” The blood-robed youth was quite
confident in the prowess of this subordinate, World God Darkfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golden warriors charged
towards them in an endless tide, but the three black golems were like
a dam that quelled their surge. As the two sides began to fight,
quite a few of the golden warriors were knocked flying while some
were actually shattered to pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Blacksun,
Elder God Wilddog, and Su Youji each commanded a black golem. All
three of them howled as bloodlust filled their veins, and they showed
no mercy in their attacks whatsoever as they furiously blew apart all
of the golden warriors charged towards them. These three black golems
came as a set, and the formation linking them together was extremely
suited for defense. The three of them were clearly far better at
blocking out the enemy warriors than the two golems which World God
Dragonbinder had used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling for a
brief moment in time, more than hundreds of golden warriors had been
knocked away. Only two golden warriors managed to make it past their
defensive perimeter, but Rocky was able to effortlessly crush both of
them. Ning just stood there, not even needing to move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ning glanced
at the situation on the other side of the battlefield. “It seems as
though we need to give this World God Darkfall a bit of pressure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and a
black gourd suddenly appeared before him in the air. The stopper to
the gourd was open, allowing it to instantly release an enormous
flood of lightning. Instantly, all five types of lightning began to
furiously slam down towards the distant World God Darkfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit.” World God
Darkfall was wielding six different warblades as he furiously hacked
at the golden warriors around him with abandon, causing many of them
to fall. But once the five types of lightning began to slam into him,
his face couldn’t help but tighten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these five
types of lightning weren’t capable of threatening his life, they
were able to encumber down his movements and have an effect on his
combat potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Ning was focusing all five types of lightning against him and
him alone! Ning had spent a total of 180 cubes of chaos nectar in
order to purchase the Pentabolt Gourd. Any weapon with such a hefty
price tag would pose at least some degree of danger to most
World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be
happening?!” World God Darkfall was clearly starting to struggle
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was feeling both
angry and humiliated! He was a master-class World God, but he was
mired into a dangerous situation while his opponent seemed to have an
airtight defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRAAAAH!” World
God Darkfall suddenly raised his head and let out a furious howl. Red
lines appeared all across his face like tattoos as his aura was
dramatically strengthened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall’s
speed suddenly rose dramatically. He moved past the golden warriors
in a ghostly manner, slaughtering a path through them as he moved
closer and closer towards Ji Ning and Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too fast! How
is he this fast?” Ji Ning was shocked. “He must’ve used some
sort of special divine ability. Even though the five types of
lightning are slowing him down, he’s still faster than me! He’s
also incredibly agile.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall was
moving in an almost serpentine fashion as he dodged past the many
enemy attacks. He continued to slaughter a path through the golden
warriors as he moved closer and closer to Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the servants
under my command, Darkfall is the fastest and most agile. He’s
completely capable of avoiding the golden warriors and moving to the
other side of the arena.” The blood-robed youth, Arroyo, was
watching with arms folded across his chest, a look of absolute
confidence in his eyes. “So what if she has four golems? Soon, all
of you will have to deal with attacks from both Darkfall as well as
the golden warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall’s
six arms were hacking away with his six mighty warblades. His
warblades attacked with incredible speed and in an unpredictable
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Saber?” Ning carefully watched the man fight. This was a World God
of the Dao of the Saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall
continued to press closer and closer towards them. Soon, he reached
an area that was directly in front of Ning and the others. Elder God
Wilddog sent mentally, “Master, we’re currently able to keep a
tight defensive perimeter against these golden warriors, but if that
World God attacks I don’t think we’ll be able to hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ning stretched his hand out, allowing a blood-colored sword to appear
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, that puny
Elder God actually took out his sword. Is he actually planning to
attack? He really has quite some gall, even though he’s clearly
suicidal!” The blood-robed youth laughed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 37 - Yes, Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe he really does
want to die.” The golden-robed youth, Fukai, was watching from afar
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the Samsara
Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black golems
continued to circle around Ji Ning and Su Youji, blocking all of the
offending golden warriors. World God Darkfall had drawn very close to
them, and his cold eyes were staring directly at the four golems and
Ning himself. “This ant-like Elder God actually dares to draw his
sword, as though he’s preparing to enter the fray? Mm. He should be
Su Youji’s retainer. Logically speaking, a single Elder God
shouldn’t make any difference at all in a battle like this, and yet
Su Youji permitted him to take part. There has to be a trap.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This puny Elder God
probably has some sort of self-sacrificial suicide attack,” World
God Darkfall mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless primordial
chaos was filled with untold mysteries. As Darkfall saw it, given
that the Flamefairy was capable of producing those four black golems
and that lightning gourd, she must have encountered a stroke of
tremendous karmic fortune. Perhaps she had some other dangerous toys
hidden up her sleeve as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, Su
Youji, you are a new Chaos Immortal and have no idea how great the
power disparity is between an Elder God and a master-class World God.
No matter what type of treasure you gave him, he still won’t pose a
threat to me.” Many thoughts flitted through Darkfall’s mind, but
he didn’t slow down in the slightest as he charged straight towards
one of the black golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This black golem’s
claw-techniques were clearly based off the mysteries of the Dao of
Fire. World God Darkfall was instantly able to identify this
particular golem as being the one which Su Youji was commanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once Su Youji dies,
all of this will be over.” Right now, Darkfall had just one target:
Su Youji!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DARKFALL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thunderous shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had been
standing within the protective encirclement of the three black
golems, the blood-colored Violetjewel in his hands. The pair of
Thunderlight Wings suddenly appeared on his back as he instantly shot
out in a streak of light, charging out of the protective encirclement
and towards World God Darkfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” World God
Darkfall laughed when he saw this. Still, since he was worried that
Ning might try to pull some sort of suicide attack or trap against
him, he remained slightly on his guard. One of his six blades howled
through the air in an illusory fashion as he released hundreds of
streaks of saber-light towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because they were
fighting atop the Samsara Grinders, World God Darkfall didn’t dare
to transform his warblades and make them thousands of meters long.
This was because if he did so, he would instantly have to deal with a
hundred times more golden warriors than he was dealing with before.
Even though he was a master-class World God, he would still be
utterly demolished and killed by them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, everyone present
including Ji Ning, World God Darkfall, and the golems all kept their
weapons to a maximum size of just a few meters long. That way, only a
comparatively low number of golden warriors would be able to assault
them at any given moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Hundreds of streaks of saber-light flew towards Ning, but most of
them actually landed upon the golden warriors who were charging
towards Darkfall. Still, a portion of them ended up flying towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. He’s nothing
more than an Elder God, while I’m a master-class World God. Any
casual blow from my saber would be more than enough to wipe him out.
You might have some powerful techniques up your sleeve, but if I
don’t let you get close to me there’s nothing you can do.”
World God Darkfall felt quite confident in his abilities, but he
continued to keep a close eye on Ning’s actions. He wanted to watch
as Ning died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thunderlight Wings
trembled as Ning charged straight towards Darkfall in an utterly
ferocious manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think you can
bar my path with those puny little blades of light?” Ning wasn’t
worried in the slightest. Sword-light flashed in his hands and
effortlessly chopped apart the incoming streaks of saber-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Elder God…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall
wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Even the blood-robed Arroyo
and the gold-robed Fukai, along with their World God servants, were
stunned. Although Darkfall had sent out those chops of saber-light in
a rather casual manner, he was still a master-class World God who
walked the path of the Dao of the Saber! Not even elite World Gods
should be able to deflect his blows in such a casual manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning was… was
this powerful?” World God Dragonbinder was stunned by what he saw
as well. When Ning dueled against the World-level experts of the
Badlands Court, he had only competed in sword-arts. He had never gone
all-out and so the disciples of the Badlands Court had no idea as to
exactly how powerful Ning was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can an Elder God
be this powerful?” The blood-robed Arroyo was absolutely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a monster. I
simply must enslave him and take him for my own.” The golden-robed
youth, Fukai, stared at Ning with a gleaming look in his eyes. He
didn’t give a damn about whether Darkfall would die or not, as
Darkfall was his foe’s subordinate. He actually hoped Darkfall
would die faster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Darkfall was completely stunned by this. Only now did he realize that
there was no so-called ‘suicide attack’. This Elder God was just
an absolute monster, a freak with incredible power who was capable of
battling against him in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a monster
like him have chosen to become Su Youji’s retainer…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WAIT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was wrong!” The
three-eyed man himself had told them that Su Youji had made her
breakthrough to become a Chaos Immortal just a few months ago. In
other words, a year ago she was nothing more than an Ancestral
Immortal. Given how ridiculously, monstrously powerful this Elder God
was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There was no way he
had been Su Youji’s retainer. Su Youji had to be his retainer!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall was
no fool. As soon as Ning revealed a hint of his true power, Darkfall
immediately came to the correct conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning showed absolute
valor and courage as he charged forward, sending golden warriors
flying in every direction from his wake. Some were actually blasted
into smithereens by his very charge itself. Ning’s sword-arts had
become even more perfected than before. World God Darkfall was able
to move past the golden warriors thanks to his tremendous speed and
agility, but Ning was able to do the same by relying on his
absolutely flawless sword-arts and the Soleheart stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how much
of a monster you are, you are still just an Elder God. Die for me!”
Darkfall let out a cold snarl as he pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be beaten into a
retreat by an Elder God would be a true humiliation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t good
enough.” Ning instantly met him mid-blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light and
saber-light clashed numerous times in the air, generating powerful
booms with each collision. The saber-light was rather fluid and
unpredictable while the sword-light thrummed with awesome power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall’s
agility and speed were both utterly astonishing, far superior to that
of most master-class World Gods. However, his saber-arts were a bit
lacking in comparison. In fact, they were considerably weaker than
Ning’s sword-arts. Thankfully for Darkfall, his advantage in speed
and agility allowed him to cover up his flaws and seek out Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used just a single
sword, but by relying on the [Heartsword Realm] he was able to
deliver awe-inspiring attacks that gave World God Darkfall no chance
to defeat him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. How can
he possibly withstand my attacks?” World God Darkfall began to
panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
every bit the match of Darkfall in a head-on collision.” The
watchers, Arroyo and Fukai included, felt their hearts quiver. These
two in particular were the favored sons of heaven and were every bit
as talented as the Starlord of Fogstone had been. In fact, they had
greater strokes of karmic fortune and were more powerful than the
Starlord was. This naturally meant that they had far broader visions
than most people… and yet, even they felt utterly speechless when
they saw this Elder God fight a master-class World God to a
standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an utter
monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a complete
freak…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry over here!
Assist me in surrounding and killing this World God Darkfall,” Ning
roared loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four golems all
assented in unison. The three black golems began to advance while
spinning together like a whirlpool, grinding apart and blasting away
all the golden warriors who assailed them. As for the stone titan
named Rocky, he helped deal with any of the stragglers who made it
through the initial defensive perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is the
true master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Elder God is
the real person in charge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present felt
stunned at the thought that they actually had the chance to witness
such a peerless monster in action. Individuals like Ji Ning only
existed in legends, and it was almost impossible to actually
encounter one of them in the flesh. Encountering someone like Ji Ning
was far more difficult than encountering a Samsara Daolord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the spirit of the
Ten Thousand Mountains Formation saw Ning break through all nine
barriers through raw force, it came to understand how much of a
monster Ning was and thus it gifted him with a powerful legacy. The
technique he had given was one of the nine mighty secret arts
possessed by Daolord Allgod, the Novessence Thunder technique. This
was a secret art which even Samsara Daolords would go mad over. The
reason the spirit had given Ning the technique was because he had
seen a faint sliver of a chance that Ning would one day reach the
same level as Daolord Allgod. Although the chance was quite small, at
least there was a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod was a
Samsara Daolord but was able to hunt down Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he was an Elder
God, he was naturally just as much of a monster, if not more so! If
you started far behind everyone else, you’d have even less of a
chance of surpassing them in the future. Still, as far as the spirit
of the Ten Thousand Mountains Formation was concerned, Ji Ning had
just a tiny chance of actually reaching Daolord Allgod’s level.
Over the course of these countless years, he had seen more then ten
such peerless geniuses and had handed them quite a few legacies, but
the most dazzling performer to date was just Daolord Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, Ji Ning might
appear to have a strong start, but who knew how outstanding a figure
he would be upon becoming a World God or becoming a Samsara Daolord?
Each step taken by a Samsara Daolord involved treading on the
boundary between life and death. To even reach the Verge of the
Daomerge was extremely difficult. Not even Daolord Badlands had
reached the Verge yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!” World
God Darkfall was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If those four golems
join forces with this monster in front of me, I’m going to be in
big trouble.” Darkfall began to panic.

Chapter 38 - A Trap
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black golems
and the stone titan worked together flawless, the three black golems
circling around Rocky as the four slowly advanced through the golden
warriors towards Ji Ning and Darkfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to kill this
monster of an Elder God before those four golems arrive.” World God
Darkfall could sense that this was an incredibly dangerous situation.
His eyes flashed red and his attack patterns suddenly changed.
Previously, he was trying to use his speed, agility, and
unpredictable saber stances to find a flaw in Ning’s attacks. Now,
he entered a berserk state and began to unleash saber-arts that
focused on overwhelming, dominating power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the six
dazzling sabers carried enough power to hack apart a chaosworld.
Limitless amounts of power permeated every single saber as they burst
forth with explosive might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
explosion after another rang out. Ning used the Eternal weapon in his
hand to block each time, but he clearly seemed to be somewhat
struggling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! What a fool I
am! This monster of an Elder God has only been using a single sword
this entire time. Clearly, his other weapons are significantly
weaker. This sword is most likely an Eternal weapon.” When World
God Darkfall saw Ning begin to stagger, he couldn’t help but feel
overjoyed. “I have six blades but he only has one sword. He was
able to easily defend against me when I focused on trying to find
flaws in his swordplay, but when I go all-out and attack him with
full force he won’t be able to withstand my blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter
how tight your defensive swordplay is. As long as I keep I hacking
down upon you with my sabers, a flaw will be revealed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two mighty Fiendgod
Refiners exchanged hundreds of blows in an instant. World God
Darkfall could sense the specter of death looming over him and so
began to furiously attack with all his might, making it very
difficult for Ning to defend against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An opening!” World
God Darkfall’s eyes lit up. He finally saw a flaw in Ning’s
defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall
didn’t hesitate at all. As soon as he saw the opening, he delivered
a strike with an icy-cold streak of saber-light. This streak of
saber-light went straight through Ning’s defensive perimeter! As
the saying goes, ‘when he is ill, go for the kill’! A single
critical strike could completely change the entire nature of a duel,
and so Darkfall quickly struck out with all five of his other swords
at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…!” Ning
blanched as he hurriedly tried to deflect, but alas, this single
mistake resulted in a cascade of mistakes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of
saber-light slammed down upon Ning at virtually the same moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” A look of
delight flashed through Darkfall’s eyes… but it was then quickly
replaced by a look of shock and rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his sabers had
landed against Ning and struck his arm, it was as though some sort of
spring mechanism had been activated. When the armor absorbed the
force of his blows, it seemed to briefly store it, then sent it right
back at Darkfall at the exact same level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that World God Darkfall had poured every last scrap of his power into
those two saber-blows, making them incredibly strong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, he was now
caught completely off-guard by this damage reflection. Two surges of
utterly terrifying power had just been sent towards him from his two
sabers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!! The twin
surges of obliterating power instantly blasted World God Darkfall
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Being prepared for an
attack and being unprepared for an attack… the results would be
completely different!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was true even for
mortals. If he saw that someone was about to push him and prepared
himself, he would at most stumble a few steps backwards. But if he
was caught completely offguard and was ‘ambushed’ by the push, he
might be instantly pushed down onto the ground! Even powerful experts
could be slain by weaker opponents who managed to catch them offguard
through a sneak attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the difference
between being prepared and being unprepared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had clearly been
struck twice, but he was only knocked a few steps backwards. Every
step he took caused the entire Samsara Grinders to shudder, and as he
did so he suddenly struck out with his Eternal weapon. Violetjewel
instantly increased to become three hundred meters long, and as soon
as World God Darkfall was knocked flying backwards Ning chopped at
him with Violetjewel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall had
no choice but to frantically position his warblades in front of him
to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already been
knocked into the air; now, he was sent smashing into the ground by
the force of Ning’s sword-blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This strike of Ning’s
had made his situation go from bad to worse!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was a trap.”
Darkfall instantly realized this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
This entire time, the golden warriors had been assaulting both sides
with no luck. However, almost all of them began throwing out ropes
towards World God Darkfall. In the moment that Darkfall had been sent
tumbling to the ground, two ropes had already tightened around his
legs. He roared as he furiously struggled to break free, trying to
use his warblades to hack the ropes apart and regain his freedom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
if he couldn’t break free, he would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Useless.” Ning
watched from afar, occasionally flicking out Violetjewel to attack
the nearby golden warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lost?” The
blood-robed Arroyo could hardly believe this was happening. Alas,
when he saw Darkfall be smashed to the ground and a rope snake around
his legs, Arroyo knew that his retainer had lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden warriors
were an extremely dangerous part of the Samsara Grinders matches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Master-class World Gods
could withstand them, but once any additional variables were
introduced (such as being knocked to the ground) even they would be
thrown into grave peril. In a situation like this, their chances of
surviving would rapidly slip away and death would be nigh! The
countless golden warriors, all of whom had reached the World
threshold of power, wouldn’t give you any chance to recover at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually
defeated by an Elder God.” The golden-robed Fukai also stared at Ji
Ning, located atop that distant Samsara Grinders. Although he was
very proud, he sensed that Ji Ning could potentially pose a huge
threat to him in the future. He knew that if this Elder God continued
to grow, he would definitely surpass both Arroyo and Fukai himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw off! Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Darkfall
fought hard to break free, but it was useless. When a second rope
coiled around his body, it became even harder for him to try and
fight back. More and more ropes coiled around him, causing a look of
despair to appear in his eyes. He turned his gaze towards the distant
Elder God Ji Ning, then let out a low growl. “A trap. It was a
trap. Just one mistake…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, the
four golems circling around him and protecting him, stopping the
golden warriors from getting close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had indeed been a
trap. Strictly speaking, it wasn’t even that clever of a trap. Then
again, when experts fought in a duel to the death there was no time
to set up particularly intricate schemes. They would at most be able
to set up a few small tricks to entrap their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning had
started to fight against World God Darkfall, he had immediately
realized that actually killing his foe would be quite difficult. Both
of them were roughly on par with each other in power. Even if the
four golems came to assist, given how fast and agile Darkfall was he
would’ve been able to easily bypass the golden warriors and flee
from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning had
deliberately said aloud, “Hurry over here! Assist me in surrounding
and killing this World God Darkfall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This order was meant to
be heard by Darkfall. Darkfall had naturally started to panic upon
hearing it. He could flee, but what good would that do? He had to win
this match and so he had naturally launched increasingly furious
attacks to try and speed this up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment, Ning
had deliberately revealed a tiny opening. Darkfall hadn’t suspected
a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had fallen hook,
line, and sinker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent 690
cubes of chaos nectar to purchase this Primalwater Armor during the
treasure auction. When its damage reflection property was activated
it had sent two incredibly powerful surges of power back towards
World God Darkfall, catching him completely off his guard. He had
suffered greatly from this attack! In truth, Primalwater Armor
normally wasn’t as effective as this, and people who were prepared
for it wouldn’t suffer quite this match. Ning, for example, had
known exactly what was going to happen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had been
struck twice, he had merely stumbled back by two steps. Knowing this
was going to happen, he immediately struck out with a critical strike
from his sword, slamming it against the already airborne World God
Darkfall and sending him crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His final strike was
the straw that broke the camel’s back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Darkfall was
knocked down to the ground and the countless golden warriors began to
swarm him, his fate was virtually sealed. Only a stroke of absolutely
incredible luck would’ve allowed him to escape this dire
predicament. Alas, his luck wasn’t good enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A golden
warrior who held a gourd in his hands sucked Darkfall inside the
gourd, then ground him to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even as Darkfall was
being drawn into the gourd, he continued to stare unblinkingly at Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning just calmly
looked back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, one of them
had to die. There were no other options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third match has
concluded.” The bald three-eyed man’s voice rang out, causing all
of the golden warriors to halt and then disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand as
well, putting away the three golems. Su Youji appeared in her true
form as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and Su Youji transformed into streaks of light, flying off of the
Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the cultivators
atop the great plaza had fallen silent. Even Arroyo and Fukai, two
incredibly experienced figures who had previously held Ning in no
regard, were silent. They stared at Ji Ning and Su Youji as the two
flew off of the Samsara Grinders… or to be precise, they stared at
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Arroyo!” The
blood-robed youth, Arroyo, stared at Ning as he spoke. “Tell me
your name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. “Arroyo,
you should spend your time worrying about your next match on the
Samsara Grinders. You will probably be next.”

Chapter 39 - Arroyo
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Arroyo and
Fukai both tightened as they turned to glance at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the five
matches had concluded, with just two more to go. Although this
freakishly strong Elder God was worthy of their attention, what
really mattered was still the divine blood of the Eternal. In the
end, the two figures who had the greatest chances of acquiring the
Eternal blood were Arroyo and Fukai. They no longer paid any
attention to Ji Ning, who simply chuckled as he and Su Youji walked
back to World God Dragonbinder’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning, you
hid your true power quite deeply,” World God Dragonbinder sent
mentally to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please pardon me,
brother Dragonbinder,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I understand.”
Dragonbinder chuckled. His comment was just a casual throwaway
comment with no real blame attached. He understand Ning’s
predicament. As the saying went, a large tree attracted the most
wind! It was even more important for freakishly powerful Elder Gods
like Ning to keep a low profile. Unless absolutely necessary, they
wouldn’t let others know of their true strength! The only reason
why Ning had revealed it today was because he had no choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Dragonbinder
now viewed Ning in a completely different light. In the past, he had
treated Ning as he would an equal due to his ties to Daolord Solesky.
However, now that he knew exactly how freakishly strong Ning was,
Dragonbinder truly wanted to befriend him. Ning was still merely an
Elder God, but he was already Dragonbinder’s equal in power. How
much more powerful would he become in the future?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your true abilities
have been revealed. You have to be careful after you leave the Allgod
Estate. I can sense that Arroyo and Fukai are incredibly dangerous.
They somehow managed to convince even supreme World Gods to be their
servants! This is truly unbelievable. They have to have a shockingly
powerful backer,” Dragonbinder sent mentally. “They might take an
unsavory interest in you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo and Fukai had
stated earlier that the three members who had taken part in the
matches thus far were the weakest members of their two groups. The
remaining four were all supreme World Gods! Fukai and Arroyo were
both supreme World Gods and they each had a supreme World God
retainer. It was truly unfathomable for a person to be willing to
subordinate himself to be a servant of someone who was merely his
equal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword-arts are
just a hair away from breaking through. I need to try my best to
become a World God here in the Allgod Estate,” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once this affair was
included, it was highly possible that Arroyo or Fukai would try to
capture Ning and force him to become a slave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was still a bit too
weak right now. After he broke through to become a World God, he
would truly have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is now time for
the fourth match.” The bald three-eyed man’s voice was filled
with a hint of mocking as he turned his gaze towards Arroyo and
Fukai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You!” The
three-eyed man pointed straight at the blood-robed Arroyo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo’s face
tightened slightly. It was finally his turn… but who would his
opponent be? Arroyo turned to glance at the gold-robed Fukai as well
as the swarthy, withered-looking man standing behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And… you!” The
three-eyed man pointed towards that swarthy, withered-looking man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buxin.” Fukai sent
a mental message to his servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
withered man respectfully acknowledged him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know
quite well how incredibly important the Eternal blood is to me. If I
cannot acquire it, I will definitely die… and you will die with me.
In fact, even your entire school will be doomed. I think you know how
angry my father will be if I die,” Fukai sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Buxin’s
pupils contracted slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai’s father was a
true devil amongst devils, an utterly terrifying figure. It would be
easy for him to annihilate Buxin’s school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if I
successfully acquire the Eternal blood, my status and power shall
skyrocket! However, my greatest obstacle right now is Arroyo. If you
can kill him, I’ll be the one to acquire the Eternal blood. I can
promise you right now that I will bestow a Pseudo Samsara Pill upon
you, and your sect will also receive my eternal protection!” Fukai
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. Buxin will do his absolute best,” World God Buxin sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want you
to your best. I want you to kill Arroyo! If I fail and die, you’ll
die as well since you are my servant. I know that you will work hard,
but you also need to be smart about this. Find a way to kill him!”
Fukai gritted his teeth, then took out a jade green globe. “I’m
willing to temporarily loan this treasure of mine to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the nearby Arroyo
saw Fukai take out that jade green globe, his face tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me warn you…”
The three-eyed man suddenly said, “All treasures, golems,
bugbeasts, seals, and even Elder God servants can only be used a
single time on the Samsara Grinders! You are forbidden from using
them twice! If you give your servant a treasure, you are not
permitted to use it for yourself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Why?” The
gold-robed Fukai was shocked. “You never mentioned this before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because no one tried
to lend someone else a treasure.” The three-eyed man said calmly,
“I’ve already said what I need to say. Decide whether or not you
wish to loan him that treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” The
blood-robed Arroyo let out a loud laugh. “Fukai, go ahead and loan
it to your servant… if you have the balls to, that is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-robed Fukai
hesitated for a moment, then turned to look at his servant. “It’ll
all be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understand, Master.”
World God Buxin nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Fukai,
would take part in the fifth match. If that precious Eternal treasure
could only be used in a single match on the Samsara Grinders, there
was no way Fukai would loan it to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures flew
straight towards the Samsara Grinders. The blood-robed Arroyo and the
withered-looking World God Buxin stared at each other from afar as
the light around them began to coalesce into those golden armored
warriors. These two supreme World Gods didn’t even blink, paying no
attention whatsoever to the golden warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think yourself
worthy of facing me?” Arroyo had a look of ridicule in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arroyo, on this day,
either you or I will perish here atop this Samsara Grinders. I have
no choice but to offend you.” World God Buxin’s voice was very
calm and flat. Arroyo had an exalted background and his status was
slightly higher than even Fukai’s, but they were more or less on
the same level. Buxin and Arroyo were both supreme World Gods, but
their statuses were completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither side could
afford to fail in this quest for the Eternal blood. World God Buxin
was going to have to fight with his full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!” The
three-eyed man ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of golden
warriors let out furious roars as they charged straight towards
Arroyo and World God Buxin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh…”
Arroyo laughed coldly as waves of blood suddenly manifested around
him. The waves of blood spread out in every direction, smashing into
those golden warriors. Some of the warriors were actually shattered
by the waves while the rest were pushed far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo waved his hand,
and nine mighty golems appeared in the area around him. Each of the
nine golems had auras of incredible power, and they were clearly even
stronger than the golems which Ning had purchased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are doomed.”
An enormous pair of scimitars suddenly appeared within Arroyo’s
hands. The scimitars were simply huge, larger than even Arroyo
himself. Both emanated auras of utterly shocking power and were
clearly Eternal weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo strode forward
confidently. The waves of blood continued to push outwards,
preventing the golden warriors from even moving close to him, while
his nine golems surrounded him like an honor guard escorting an
emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
power.” Ning was shocked by what he saw. The blood waves alone were
so powerful that they were perhaps superior to most master-class
World Gods in might. Those two weapons Arroyo were wielding were most
likely Eternal weapons as well. Once he attacked, he would definitely
be able to unleash the power of a supreme World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And most likely, he
would be an incredibly strong one, superior to other supreme World
Gods such as God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even World God
Northrest only had access to one Eternal weapon, but both of Arroyo’s
scimitars appear to be Eternal weapons. And those nine golems
surrounding him… I imagine every single one of them has to be worth
over a thousand cubes of chaos nectar. Given that they are able to
join together into a formation, the entire set has to be worth tens
of thousands of cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked by
Arroyo’s wealth. He now felt a sense of pressure. Just as
Dragonbinder had warned him, it was very likely that either Fukai or
Arroyo would try to capture him after these trials were concluded.
They would want to force Ning to become a servant or a slave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying power
which Arroyo had just put on display would be turned against Ning.
Would Ning be able to handle it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then there was
Fukai, someone who was just as terrifying as Arroyo himself…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! World
God Buxin calmly walked forward, having manifested a total of
eighteen arms. These eighteen arms were unleashing a series of
palm-arts and fist-arts, and each time they struck a golden warrior
the golden warrior would be smashed into tiny pieces. He just calmly
walked forward through the sea of golden armored foes towards Arroyo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides completely
ignored the golden warriors. They only had eyes for each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only one of the two
would survive!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 40 - Close the Gates
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between
Arroyo and World God Buxin went on for nearly an entire hour.
Finally, the battle came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. How
could this have happened?” The golden-robed Fukai was muttering to
himself, a look of disbelief in his eyes. He truly couldn’t believe
what he had just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened? Is this… is this my destiny? My doom?” Fukai felt his
entire body turn as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, World God
Dragonbinder, Su Youji had already safely secured victory in their
match. Although they were quite curious about this ‘Eternal blood’,
it wasn’t something which they absolutely had to acquire. Thus,
they had been watching the fourth match quite calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh. So that
happened.” World God Dragonbinder was still rather stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive.” Ning
sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, would he now
be considered a transcendent figure amongst World Gods?” The
Flamefairy asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly. “I
think he should be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle had been
utterly exhilarating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As World God Buxin
entered the battlefield, his power actually began to increase! He
used his fists and his feet as his weapons, and when his eighteen
arms struck out they formed an inviolable domain that swept away any
who sought to breach it. All nine of Arroyo’s golems had been
somewhat suppressed by him! Fukai had been incredibly excited upon
seeing this as nothing would have made him happier than seeing Arroyo
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arroyo really did
have quite a few treasures. He used up so many treasures that he was
able to buy himself a considerable amount of time. In the end, just
as he was about to lose, he went completely berserk and actually made
a breakthrough. He became much more powerful as a result.” Ning
still couldn’t get that dazzling saber-strike out of his mind.
Gripped by utter despair, Arroyo released an utterly dazzling strike
with his saber that suddenly exploded with unbelievable power. That
strike had completely knocked Buxin off his feet and had sent him
flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo had been wildly
overjoyed. He had struck out two more times, causing World God Buxin
to tumble down to the ground. The golden warriors had seized the
moment to tie him up with his ropes, and shortly afterwards he was
drawn into one of their gourds and grind apart into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth match
ended,” the bald three-eyed man announced. Even he couldn’t help
but give the blood-robed Arroyo a glance. Transcendent World Gods
were incredibly rare. Any master-class World God who acquired an
Eternal weapon or some incredibly powerful treasures would possess
the power of a supreme World God, but to transcend past the supreme
level was incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One had to reach an
incredibly high level of skill in a certain aspect in order to become
a transcendent World God. These figures were incredibly rare! The
number of transcendent World Gods in the entire Badlands Territory
could be counted on one hand. They were just as rare as Samsara
Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! I won! I WON!
Ahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo flew downwards
alongside his servants, a look of crazed joy and excitement on his
face. The blood sea hidden within his eyes seemed to be roaring and
shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fukai. Your servant
really was quite impressive. He actually forced me to the utter
brink. Haha! I really need to find a way to thank him. If it hadn’t
been for him forcing me to the brink of utter despair, I never
would’ve been able to comprehend the true essence of the ‘Sanguine
Decay’.” Arroyo was filled with smugness as he stared at the
gold-robed Fukai. “Fukai, if you can’t accept this outcome, make
your own breakthrough as well! That way, you’d also become a
transcendent figure…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo was filled with
complete confidence now. “You’ve lost. You’ve utterly lost. The
divine blood of the Eternal is mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My match hasn’t
even started. You are celebrating too soon.” A gloomy look was on
Fukai’s face as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at how unhappy
you are! This is the first time I’ve seen you with such an ugly
look on your face.” Arroyo snickered loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai had always looked
completely calm, unflappable, and self-assured. Now, however, an
extremely dark and gloomy look was on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai no longer had any
confidence in his ability to win. To advance from being a supreme
World God to become a transcendent one was an impossibly difficult
step to take! However, Fukai still clung onto hope. “If Arroyo can
make a breakthrough, why can’t I? I’ll definitely make a
breakthrough as well. I’m going to acquire that Eternal blood, then
become a Samsara Daolord. My path has just begun… I’m not going
to be beaten. I’m not!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth match.”
The three-eyed man spoke out again. “It goes without saying that
you two will be the ones to participate. That match just now was
quite dazzling. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a
transcendent World God. Don’t let the final match be a
disappointment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed Arroyo
laughed, while Fukai’s face turned serious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Arroyo
ordered his subordinate. “Play with him a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Behind Arroyo was an alien creature who looked something like an ape.
His entire body was covered with black fur and protected by a suit of
golden armor. When he allowed his aura to spread out, it crashed out
towards everyone else like waves slamming against the beach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Fukai let
out a cold snort, then immediately transformed into a streak of light
as he flew towards the Samsara Grinders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die. The
black-furred ape flew towards the Samsara Grinders as well, filled
with a murderous aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
continued to simply watch from below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That jade green
globe actually held an army of bugbeasts inside of it.” Su Youji
sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really had quite
a few treasures.” World God Dragonbinder couldn’t help but speak
out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah. Him and Arroyo
are no ordinary World-level cultivators.” Ning couldn’t help but
sigh. These guys were simply too rich. That jade green globe held an
entire world within it that was exclusively devoted to rearing
bugbeasts. The rules of the competition meant that only nine of the
bugbeasts could be unleashed, but all nine were comparable to
master-class World Gods who could give even Ning a run for his money!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been a truly
wild battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai had intentionally
let himself fall into dangerous situations, hoping that the pressure
of it all would result in him making a breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, breakthroughs
weren’t that easy to make. In addition, he very nearly died due to
a dangerous situation he put himself into. In the end, he only
survived because he used a Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle went on for
four full hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve done
everything I can, Master.” The black-furred ape let out a low
growl. The four hours of frenzied combat had completely wiped out his
reserves of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die in peace. I’ll
protect your entire race.” Arroyo smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle came to an
end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ape’s divine
power was completely used up, resulting in his death. Fukai was the
victor! However, he didn’t seem to be the slightest bit pleased by
his victory. He put away his bugbeasts and flew off the Samsara
Grinders in a rather numbed, dazed manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fukai.” Arroyo
looked at Fukai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met. One
would acquire the Eternal blood and survive. The other would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lost,” Arroyo
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…” Fukai
ground his teeth. He had won his match, but he had lost the
competition between himself and Arroyo. Although he had intentionally
let himself fall into dangerous situations, he hadn’t made any
breakthroughs at all! He knew very well that Arroyo was now far more
powerful than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had
established the trial of the Twin Samsara Heavens for anyone who
sought to acquire Eternal blood. Given what a proud figure he was, it
was guaranteed that everything would be happened in accordance with
his will. There was no way that World God Dragonbinder, World God
Boneplate, Flamefairy Su Youji, or Fukai would be the ones to earn
the Eternal blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was only one
possible victor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transcendent World Gods
were incredibly rare. He, and he alone, was qualified to be
considered the victor of this trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five matches
have come to an end.” The bald three-eyed man spoke out, causing
everyone present to turn towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five World-level
cultivators remain.” The three-eyed man swept his gaze across
Arroyo, Boneplate, Fukai, Dragonbinder, and Su Youji. These five had
survived; the other five had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternal blood aside,
all survivors will be given a bit of karmic good fortune.” The
three-eyed man smiled as he pointed towards the towering gates of the
Castrum Divinitus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These massive gates had
been shut for countless years. They now slowly began to move, and it
was like two giant continents were swinging open. Past the gates was
utter darkness. Nothing could be seen at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The survivors shall
all be granted entry into the Castrum Divinitus, and all of you will
benefit from it.” The three-eyed man turned to look at Fukai,
Arroyo, and Boneplate. “The three of you experienced many dangers
to reach this place. Even for those of you who do not acquire the
Eternal blood, you will still be blessed with some karmic fortune.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you.” The
three-eyed man turned to look at Dragonbinder, Su Youji, and Ji Ning.
“I teleported all of you here against your will, then forced you to
enter duels to the death. Since you have survived, I shall bless you
with good fortune as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the
Eternal blood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed Arroyo
said hurriedly, “I don’t care about other ‘fortunes’. I only
care about the Eternal blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This group has
performed excellently and is qualified to receive the Eternal blood,”
the three-eyed man said. “However, you’ll only find out if you
shall be the one to receive the Eternal blood after you enter the
Castrum Divinitus. Each of you will be teleported to a different part
of the Castrum Divinitus, with the victor being sent directly to the
Eternal blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you take
it out right now?” Arroyo frowned. “Only five of the ten have
survived! What, are you saying that it’s possible that someone
besides me shall win the Eternal blood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arroyo began to grow
rather impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-eyed man’s
face turned cold as he said flatly, “The divine blood of the
Eternal is incredibly precious. It is stored deep within the Castrum
Divinitus, which is why the victor has to go in person to retrieve
it. As for who that person is, you’ll know shortly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. All of you,
get in.” The three-eyed man swept the cultivators with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, let’s
go.” World God Dragonbinder chortled merrily. “I’m not too
ambitious and know my own limits. The Eternal blood isn’t for me.
Still, to be blessed with some karmic fortune isn’t too shabby!
Very few will ever be able to even enter the core region of the
Allgod Estate, the Castrum Divinitus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. If we
refuse to enter, he’ll just grab us and forcibly throw us inside.
I’d rather that not happen.” Ning and Su Youji walked inside as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Fukai had a
gloomy look on his face as he also passed through the gates of the
Castrum Divinitus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have faith.”
Arroyo nodded. “I’m sure that the trials left behind by Daolord
Allgod were fair ones and will be judged fairly.” The only reason
why Arroyo had been quibbling was because he truly couldn’t afford
to lose this trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, all of them
walked towards the Castrum Divinitus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. World God
Dragonbinder was the first to step inside the castle. As soon as he
took a single step into the endless darkness, he completely
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji
twitched slightly when they saw this. The insides of the castle were
pitch-black, and they couldn’t see a single thing within the
darkness at all. As for coresense or heartforce, they naturally were
completely ineffective here. Still, they understood that it would be
very easy for Daolord Allgod to slay them if that was the goal. There
was no need for any tricks or schemes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go in.”
Ning and Su Youji both stepped into the Castrum Divinitus,
disappearing into the endless darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fukai, Arroyo, and
Boneplate all entered the Castrum Divinitus as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald three-eyed man
waved his hand, causing the Samsara Grinders to shrink as it flew
back into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Close the gates!”
The three-eyed man laughed merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive, towering
gates of the Castrum Divinitus rumbled shut.
