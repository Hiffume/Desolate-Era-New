Chapter 1 - Nuwa Immortal Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Houyi, Fuxi,
and their squad of major powers appeared in the air above the
Humanworld of Yu the Great. They immediately saw the many figures
awaiting them before the Allclans Palace, including Daoist Three
Purities, Shennong, Suiren, and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
over to them,” Fuxi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
the others all quickly flew over towards the Allclans Palace, then
landed in front of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoists,
please accept our thanks.” Daoist Three Purities was the first to
bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong, Suiren,
Patriarch Subhuti, and the other major powers all bowed together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all bowing in
order to express their thanks towards Ji Ning, Fuxi, Houyi, Kuafu,
Jade Cauldron, and the others for risking their lives for many years
in this campaign against the Primordial Ruinworld. Although they had
suffered several setbacks, with Lord Tathagata the Buddha losing two
of his dharma-bodies, overall their losses hadn’t been too heavy.
In the end, they had accomplished the goals they had set out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace.
Everyone returned to their seats. Ning sat down as well, but he chose
to sit next to Subhuti and Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoists,”
Daoist Three Purities said, “Our warriors went out on campaign
against the Primordial Ruinworld. The Primordial Ruinworld was more
powerful than we expected, and they encountered some dangers on the
way. Two extremely formidable alien Outsider overlords ended up
appearing out of nowhere. Fortunately for us, Darknorth has become
dramatically more powerful. He was able to hold down our losses and
keep them manageable. In the end, Tathagata lost the most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Lord Buddha
smiled as he looked towards Ning. “There were losses, but there
were also gains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Daoist
Three Purities laughed. “The Primordial Ruinworld has been
destroyed. The Seamless Gate can forget about allying with those
alien Outsiders and hiding in the Primordial Ruinworld in the future.
If we can win the Endwar, we will have nothing else to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth has become
an overlord.” Suiren spoke out. “We haven’t held a celebratory
banquet for him yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to go to all
that trouble,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
when a new True God or Daofather was born a celebratory banquet would
be held. However, since Ning had made his breakthrough while he was
in the primordial chaos, no one had known about it. Since he had been
warring for years, there hadn’t been a chance to hold a banquet for
him yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar is coming
soon. I agree that it isn’t appropriate for us to hold a
celebratory banquet at a time like this.” Subhuti nodded. “So
many of us are gathered here in the Allclans Palace. Let us simply
offer him our well-wishes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, congratulations.” Houyi was the first
to offer a toast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, congratulations.” Lu Dongbin, seated below the
overlords, also raised a toast as he smiled at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth, congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True God Darknorth,
congratulations…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Various forms of
address could be heard as the major powers laughed and cheered. They
all behaved fairly casually. Normally, there were so few major powers
in the Three Realms that the ascension of every single one of them
was a major event. Generally speaking, large-scale celebrations would
be held for the new major power. However, times were different now,
which was why Ning’s ‘banquet’ became a much simpler affair.
Still, although the major powers behaved fairly casually, they still
had to maintain at least a bit of decorum; Ji Ning was now an
overlord-class figure, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Subhuti, and Fuxi
were seated shoulder-to-shoulder within a wooden boat which was
flying through the endless Void. They had left their incarnations
within the Allclans Palace. In fact, most of the major powers
‘present’ within the Allclans Palace had actually only sent their
incarnations as well, with their true bodies standing guard over
various locations. By keeping their incarnations there, they would be
able to maintain constant contact and mobilize together at a moment’s
notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa Immortal
Realm?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Nuwa
Immortal Realm.” Subhuti let out a laugh. “Before Mother Nuwa
left the Three Realms, she created a special estate-world of absolute
beauty. However, the number of people in the Three Realms aware of
its existence can be counted on two hands. Most of the other major
powers don’t know about it, but it is one of the most important
realms belonging to the Nuwa Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Fuxi and Subhuti
had led him out of the Allclans Palace, they had told him that they
were going to tell him all their secrets. They had also told him that
they would first have to go to the ‘Nuwa Immortal Realm’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Subhuti waved his finger, causing a spatial whirlpool to appear in
the air in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wooden boat flew
into the spatial whirlpool, then quickly disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A moment later, a
ripple of power swept past the place they had just left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. What were
Subhuti and Fuxi saying to Ji Ning? Where have they gone? Subhuti’s
control over spacetime is simply too formidable. No one in the Three
Realms surpasses him in this regard. There’s simply no way to
follow him.” The ripple of power quickly dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After passing through
the spatial whirlpool, the three saw an absolutely beautiful world
appear before them. Flowers and trees covered the entire world, and
it was filled with all sorts of fragrant scents. Wild animals were
running around happily, and lovely creeks, roaring rivers, and
massive thundering waterfalls could all be seen in the world below
them. The rivers could be seen winding through the mountains before
flowing into the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only creatures
which existed in this world were ordinary birds and beasts which
possessed low levels of intelligence. There were no other intelligent
beings here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti waved his hand,
putting away the wooden boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to use this
treasure if you wish to enter the Nuwa Immortal Realm,” Subhuti
said with a smile. “Mother Nuwa once created a total of three of
these boats. If you don’t have one of them, there’s no way to
enter this place at all. I have tremendous control over spacetime and
can locate this mysterious, hidden world on my own, but not even I am
capable of entering it without this boat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least you can
find it. The rest of us can’t even find the Nuwa Immortal Realm!”
Fuxi laughed. “Nuwa truly was amazing. She was skilled in so many
Daos, including even the Dao of Spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but silently sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Immortal Realm
truly was a mysterious place. One could only enter it when making use
of the flying boats which Nuwa had left behind? It seemed that this
really was one of the secret mysteries of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Subhuti and
Fuxi flew in front with Ji Ning following from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they arrived
within a beautiful peach garden. The area around them was surrounded
by beautiful peach trees, and inside the peach garden was an
ordinary-looking wooden cabin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Subhuti
was the first to enter the wooden cabin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed behind
and entered as well. Upon doing so, he found that the insides of the
cabin were quite plain and unadorned as well. The only thing it held
was bookshelves, and the bookshelves were filled with jade scrolls
and slips. Subhuti pointed at some of the jade slips. “These wooden
cabins are all filled with many jade slips, as well as some
storage-type treasures. These jade slips over here contain all of the
powerful techniques, spells, and divine abilities which the Nuwa
Alliance has acquired! These aren’t just our own original
techniques; the techniques of the alien Outsiders are included here
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All?” Ning was
shocked. The various major powers would generally keep their own
secret killing techniques hidden from others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the major powers
were willing to hand over their supreme techniques?” Ning was quite
curious. “If they wanted to keep them hidden, I imagine that Mother
Nuwa wouldn’t have been able to discover them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Mother Nuwa
became a Pangu-level God, she was at an incredibly high level of
insight and power. In front of Mother Nuwa…there was no way for any
of the major powers to keep anything hidden whatsoever.” Subhuti
shook his head. “You’ve never met Mother Nuwa. If you did, you
would understand. There’s no way you can even lie in front of her.
It was Mother Nuwa herself who created the number one fate-type
treasure of the Three Realms, the Book of Life and Death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Book of Life and
Death truly was an unearthly item. It recorded the lives of all of
the countless living beings of the Three Realms, and it was capable
of changing their fates, their very destinies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, Mother
Nuwa would often provide guidance to the other major powers,”
Subhuti said. “These techniques actually won’t be of much use to
you. What really will be of use are the techniques which Mother Nuwa
herself left behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti pointed towards
a wall of the wooden house. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A technique suddenly
appeared as countless characters manifested on the wooden walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the [Unbound
Elder God Visualization] scroll,” Subhuti said as he pointed
towards the walls. “When Mother Nuwa became a Pangu-level God, she
became what is known as a ‘World God’ in the primordial chaos.
After becoming a World God, she spent time meditating on the
mysteries of her divine body, spending an enormous amount of effort
in developing this [Unbound Elder God Visualization] scroll. If you
use this technique, you will have a chance of becoming an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we’ve
killed a number of alien Outsiders, techniques that allow one to
become an Elder God are all secret techniques; they were all forced
to swear lifeblood oaths, making it so that we were not able to
acquire any of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you have
become a True God; this technique should be of use to you,” Subhuti
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave it a careful
read. He never would’ve thought that the Nuwa Alliance actually had
a technique that could allow one to become an Elder God! This was a
very, very rare thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique is
exceedingly important to us, as the birth of any new Elder God is a
momentous affair for the entire Three Realms,” Subhuti said. “This
is why, even in the Nuwa Alliance, only True Gods of incredible
talent and absolutely unswerving loyalty would be given a chance to
acquire this technique. If we aren’t absolutely convinced of their
loyalty, we absolutely won’t divulge this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite
surprised by what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Solitary World
God] was an extremely formidable technique that could allow one to
train all the way to the World God level. It was an extremely
high-class technique, and the underlying principles of the technique
lay in spending tremendous time in solitude in order to find a spark
of insight within one’s own divine body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This [Unbound Elder God
Visualization] scroll, however, was more like a visualization
technique; it was about taking something illusory and making it real,
then refining and mastering it. Its principles were completely
different from that of the [Solitary World God].
</P>

Chapter 2 - The Lord of Cui Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Theoretically speaking,
the principles of the [Unbound Elder God Visualization] technique
seemed to be on a higher level. However, the [Solitary World God] was
more detailed and more highly refined; it was, after all, a technique
which countless experts had trained in and improved, giving it a
higher success rate for mastery. Although the underlying principles
of the [Unbound Elder God Visualization] technique were incredibly
profound, Mother Nuwa had created it as a new and inexperienced World
God. In addition, since the [Solitary World God] allowed one to train
all the way up to the World God level, its creator was clearly far
more powerful than Mother Nuwa had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, from the
creation of this technique alone Ji Ning could sense how incredibly
talented Mother Nuwa had been. Even in a fairly ‘backwards’
chaosworld like the Three Realms, she had been able to train to such
incredible heights. What level of power must she have reached once
she entered the far vaster world of the endless primordial chaos?
This truly was a difficult question to answer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning
suddenly said, “Since we have this technique…do we have any Elder
Gods on our side?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
always believed that the Three Realms only had a single Elder God;
the Lord of All Fiends. This was what even Fuxi and Tathagata had
told him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi and Subhuti
exchanged a glance, then laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do,” Fuxi said.
“The reason why we previously didn’t tell you was because we
needed to keep it secret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do?” Ning was
surprised and delighted. “Who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Purities,
Tathagata, and the others were all quite formidable, but they were
still ‘just’ True Gods and third-tier Ancestral Immortals. They
had to work hard on their insights into the Dao to become comparable
to ordinary Elder Gods. True Elder Gods, however, all had that level
of power, even if their techniques were comparatively low-class. If
they had superior techniques and insights into the Dao, they would be
elite Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of our Elder
Gods of Primordial Chaos is actually still alive,” Subhuti said
with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?” Ning was
quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancestral Dragon
and the Phoenix had both died. Nuwa had left, Fuxi had been
reincarnated, while Zhurong and Rushou had all perished. Who was
still alive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Elder God of
Water, Gonggong!” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gonggong? The one
who broke Mount Buzhou?” Ning immediately knew who Subhuti was
speaking of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Subhuti
let out a sigh. “That’s the one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why has he
never shown himself?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the war that
ended the Primordial Era, Zhurong ended up dying to save Gonggong,”
Subhuti said. “Zhurong died, while Gonggong lived…all these
years, Gonggong has felt survivor’s guilt over this matter. He’s
always felt ashamed, that he owed Zhurong. He’s never been able to
get over it. Still, no need to worry about him. He will definitely
appear during the Endwar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
felt a surge of delight. Gonggong was born an Elder God; after having
lived for a full chaos cycle, he must’ve improved in power at least
a little. He was undoubtedly very strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone else? Has
anyone successfully mastered the [Unbound Elder God Visualization]
scroll?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Subhuti
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suiren.” Fuxi
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
“Suiren? H-he…he’s an Elder God? But…but why he wasn’t able
to suppress Keeper Everwood when I was assassinated by the Seamless
Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though you lost
one of your bodies, we had to keep the fact that Suiren is an Elder
God a secret.” Subhuti looked at Ning. “We were in the midst of
the war for karmic luck, and all of our efforts were directed towards
winning it. No matter how much we wished to save you, we couldn’t
reveal Suiren’s true power. Even if you only had a single body and
were at risk of true death, we still would’ve made the same
decision.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood this principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the reason
why we took the chaos nectar you gave us and gave it all to Suiren,”
Subhuti said with a smile. “Suiren was always a tremendously
talented figure; even as a True God, he was comparable to Elder Gods
in power. But now that he is a true Elder God…he definitely is an
elite Elder God in power! Now that he also has the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique? When the Endwar comes, he’ll give the
Seamless Gate a nice little surprise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning felt
excited upon hearing this. “Any other Elder Gods?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncertain.”
Subhuti shook his head. “As far as we know, the only one who
successfully became an Elder God thanks to the [Unbound Elder God
Visualization] technique was Suiren! It’s possible that no one else
has mastered it, but it’s also possible that some of the True Gods
are hiding their true power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded. In the end, most major powers only truly trusted themselves.
Only a secret that was shared with none was guaranteed ot be a true
secret!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, given that
Buddha Jueming had acquired techniques from Undermoon Lake, he
certainly had to be an extraordinarily powerful figure. Most people
in the Three Realms, however, viewed him as just being an ordinary
Daofather. Ning felt certain that other True Gods and Daofathers on
his side were hiding their power as well. It had been more than half
a chaos cycle since the end of the Primordial Era, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a chaos cycle…such
a long period of time was enough for virtually anything to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But by the same
principle, it was also hard for them to ascertain the true power of
the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t be
over-confident,” Subhuti said. “When the Lord of All Fiends took
the survivors of the Seamless Gate and fled with them into the
endless primordial chaos, they journeyed through it for a
considerable period of time. What happened during those years? What
did the Lord of All Fiends experience? None of us knows the answer.
In fact, not even Everwood knows the answer. Only the Lord of All
Fiends himself knows the truth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…the
Seamless Gate flourished for many years in the Three Realms. On the
surface though they still only have three overlord-class experts; the
Lord of All Fiends, the Keeper of the Everwood, and Daomother
Devilhand. I refuse to believe that they haven’t produced a single
new overlord in all these years.” Subhuti shook his head. “Some
of our major powers have been hiding their true might, but the same
is true for the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the
end…everything will only be made clear once the Endwar begins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before planning for
victory, first plan for defeat,” Subhuti said. “As with before, I
shall not take part in the Endwar. If our side sees no chance of
victory, then I’ll lead our survivors in fleeing from the Three
Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” Ning
looked at Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This was the
arrangement which Mother Nuwa made all the way back during the
Primordial Era,” Subhuti said. “This is why I’ve been focusing
so much on my mastery of spacetime. I want to ensure that when I lead
our survivors away, there will be no way anyone can follow us.
Although the Lord of All Fiends is incredibly fast, his skill lies in
the Dao of Space alone! He can’t match me in spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti held absolute
confidence in his mastery of spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning, Subhuti, and
Fuxi continued to chat inside the wooden cabin, footsteps suddenly
rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
his head to look, only to see an azure-robed middle-aged man walk in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Long time
no see.” The azure-robed man smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Lord of Cui
Palace.” Ning was filled with disbelief. “You live here? All
these years…I’ve never been able to find you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the six hundred
years his clones had been in Undermoon Lake, Ning had journeyed
through the Three Realms but had been unable to find Lord Cui. It was
as though the man had suddenly disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the
treasure-spirit of the Book of Life and Death. To tell the truth,
Nuwa handed over the Nuwa Immortal Realm to me for managing. After
the Netherworld Kingdom was destroyed, I naturally chose to come
here,” Lord Cui said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Subhuti
smiled as well. “The relationship between Lord Cui and Mother Nuwa
is much like the relationship between your giant yellow bear Daoist
Threelives. Understand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Book of Life and
Death…this was the most famous treasure which Mother Nuwa had ever
created, and it contained inconceivable power over the workings of
fate and destiny. Mother Nuwa must have poured all of her blood,
sweat, and tears into the creation of this treasure, and she must
have carried it by her side for a very long period of time as well.
It was only natural for the treasure-spirit to become very close to
Mother Nuwa. In truth, many major powers held more faith in their
treasure-spirits than in any other beings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because there
was no way a treasure-spirit would ever disobey his or her master.
They were absolutely loyal and devoted servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, I managed
to shed off the trappings of the Book of Life and Death and became an
independent life form, capable of training on my own.” Lord Cui
looked at Ning. “I ended up creating a clone and sent it into the
path of reincarnation, and that clone ended up entering your own
homeworld of ‘Earth’. That’s why I said that we came from the
same hometown.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning was weak, he
had been quite puzzled by this; if Lord Cui had originally been a
cultivator from the Tang Dynasty of Earth, then he should have only
recently become the First Judge of the Dead. And yet, the records of
the Three Realms indicated that Lord Cui’s great reputation had
existed for countless years already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did he realize
that Lord Cui had long ago become the First Judge of the Dead, and
that it was just one of his clones which he had sent to be reborn in
Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How truly
marvelous.” Lord Cui smiled as he looked at Ning. “I still
remember what a weak, gentle youth you were. Back on Earth, you were
just a bedridden patient…but now, you stand at the very peak of the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to thank you,
Lord Cui, for bestowing the ‘Nuwa Painting’ visualization
technique upon me,” Ning said. “Without it, I would never have
been able to accomplish what I did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Nuwa Painting’
visualization technique no longer meant anything to him, but it was
the reason why he had been able to survive and acquire the legacy of
the ‘underwater estate’. Only then did he become able to join the
Black-White College, become the champion of the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny, and become the disciple of Subhuti. Without the benefit of
starting off with the Nuwa Painting…he might’ve still been
successful, but it was unlikely that he would become as successful as
he was now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually bestowed
the Nuwa Painting upon quite a few people, but none of them were as
impressive as you.” Lord Cui laughed. “When I first saw you, I
had the feeling that there was a certain toughness and resilience
about you, that you would never collapse no matter what setbacks or
pressures you faced. Earth is a place where there is no such thing as
cultivation, but even there you were able to change your own destiny,
living for two years longer than you had originally been scheduled to
live for. I had the feeling that, given a bit of help, you would be
able to make a miracle happen. That is why I bestowed the Nuwa
Painting upon you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Cui, you…”
Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely. I already
had the sense that the Seamless Gate was up to no good, which was why
I began bestowing the Nuwa Painting upon certain promising prospects
which I encountered! This would make it easier for them to
cultivate…but of course, this was just one of many small plans I
put in place. It’s quite unlikely for something as minor as the
Nuwa Painting to result in the birth of a Daofather or True God; in
fact, less than ten people I helped out were even able to become
Celestial Immortals!” Lord Cui shook his head, laughing as he
looked at Ning. “Thank goodness for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Cui, you really
accomplished a great deed for us,” Subhuti laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” Lord Cui
laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Cui, I tried to
search for my old home of ‘Earth’, but I’ve never been able to
find it,” Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
shook his head. “Of course not. It’s much like how the Crescent
world is located in an entirely different space-time continuum. Some
of the trillions of minor worlds of the Three Realms are also hidden
in their own pocket space-time continuums. After Mother Nuwa became a
World God, she worked hard to set up these many minor worlds in their
own little pockets, and your home planet of Earth was one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what
troubles the Three Realms go through, these minor worlds will remain
blessed places,” Lord Cui explained. “Only when the entire Three
Realms is destroyed will these worlds be destroyed as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked in a soft
voice, “I wonder how my parents of my past life are doing…” The
relationship between himself and his parents in his past life wasn’t
as unshakably close as his relationship to his parents in this life,
but he had never forgotten about them. He had never forgotten about
how his mother had taken care of him. Although his father had been
more focused on his career, Ning’s feelings towards his father were
quite complicated as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They live in a
blessed land. Naturally, they have nothing to worry about,” Lord
Cui said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you explain in
detail?” Ning relaxed slightly as he asked this question.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_3___Stars"></A>
Chapter 3 - Stars
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Cui said, “When
you became apprenticed to Subhuti, your previous parents were still
alive. I helped them change their fate, allowing them to live to be a
hundred years old before passing away peacefully. They then were
reincarnated into another blessed world; naturally, their lives were
calm and smooth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to live a
century in peace was a good thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reincarnated into
another blessed world?” Ning was puzzled about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother Nuwa set up
many minor worlds in separate pockets of spacetime. All of them are
blessed lands,” Lord Cui explained. “Even after the Six Paths of
Reincarnation were destroyed, the process of reincarnation in those
blessed lands was not disrupted in the slightest. Those who die in a
blessed world shall be reborn into another blessed world. It might be
Earth or it might be a different blessed world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But didn’t I end
up being sent to the Netherworld Kingdom?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because I
chose you,” Lord Cui said. “All those blessed worlds are linked
together, but I selected you as a person who was suitable for
Immortal cultivation. However, those worlds are all too small; they
aren’t really suitable for an Immortal to grow in. That was why I
teleported your soul directly to the Netherworld Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, Ning finally
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder he had never
met a single person who had been reincarnated from Earth. So it was
because Earth was a ‘blessed world’; unless something special
happened, no one from Earth would ever be reincarnated into the
various major worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if the
blessed worlds will be able to survive after this tribulation.”
Lord Cui slowly shook his head. “Oh, right. I heard that you slew
the Four Thearchs of the Primordial Ruinworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should have
acquired their treasures, yes? Take a look and see if they had any
star maps,” Lord Cui said. “Star maps are maps that record the
various paths that exist through the primordial chaos. We’ve killed
quite a few alien Outsiders since the Primordial Era. The more
powerful ones such as Rahu or the Lord of All Things, as well as
their True God and Daofather subordinates. We’ve acquired quite a
few star maps from them, but the more star maps the better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled for a
moment, then chuckled. “I haven’t sorted through them yet. Please
wait a moment, Lord Cui.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Star maps…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was vast and endless, filled with opportunity and danger. Even a
small place like the Three Realms had dangerous places such as
Earthmoan Mountain or the Endless Sea. The primordial chaos naturally
held far more terrifying dangers within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a World God could
get lost if he or she just flew around blindly, and it was even
possible for them to die in a particularly dangerous area. That was
why one had to have star maps to journey by. Mortals needed sea
charts when navigating the seas, and Fiendgods needed star maps to
navigate the primordial chaos. The reason why they were called ‘star
maps’ was because the primary method for long-distance
transportation in the primordial chaos was through spacetime transfer
arrays!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was simply too vast; to slowly fly or teleport through it would take
far too much time. Spacetime transfer arrays, however, were ancient
constructs that had existed in the primordial chaos since time
antiquity. They used stars and planets as their foundation, with the
stellar bodies being forged together to form spacetime transfer
arrays! One could instantly travel from one spacetime transfer array
to a different, distant array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through repeated array
transfers, one would be able to quickly reach the desired location!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since the
spacetime transfer arrays used giant stars and planets as parts of
the array, the maps that showed the various paths and connections
between them were known as ‘star maps’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some Immortals or
Fiendgods memorize then destroy every star map they see,” Subhuti
said. “Others keep them intact and trade them to others. This is
why we managed to acquire a few star maps from the alien Outsiders we
have slain. However, we’ve generally found that the more powerful
an Outsider is, the better the star maps in their possession are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Found one.” Ning
suddenly revealed a look of delight. He waved his hand, producing a
metallic scroll. He unfurled the metallic scroll, allowing it to
sparkle with spots of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single spot of
light represents a spacetime transfer array.” Subhuti pointed at
the star map, clearly quite familiar with these things. “These
unremarkable little dots here represent chaosworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three spacetime
transfer arrays, seven hundred and twenty-one chaosworlds,” Ning
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How crude.” Fuxi
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is pretty crude.
It seems the person who owned this star map was fairly low in rank.”
Lord Cui shook his head as well. This was the star map which had been
in the possession of Thearch Darkstill. When he had first joined the
Lord of All Things, he had been quite weak; at the time, it was quite
impressive for him to be able to acquire even a crude star map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me, Ji Ning.”
Lord Cui looked at him. “I’ve acquired quite a few star maps
since the Primordial Era. I’ve put them all together into a single
large star map. Let me take you to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Intrigued,
Ning hurriedly followed behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had once sworn a
lifeblood oath to seek out and locate Vastheaven Palace. Although
World God Northrest had left behind a very large and detailed star
map for him, it was of no use! World God Northrest had been fleeing
for his life, and so he ran about randomly, jumping through every
array he found. He fled so quickly that even he himself wouldn’t be
able to find his way back. Thus, the large and detailed star map he
left behind represented a place that was extremely far away, very
deep within the primordial chaos. For now, it would be of no help to
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So they compiled all
the maps into a single giant star map? I hope there are a few places
which connect to the places marked down in World God Northrest’s
star map. That will make traveling to Vastheaven Palace much easier,”
Ning mused to himself. Still, he knew this was unlikely. World God
Northrest had arrived in the Primordial Era and had stayed in the
Three Realms for a long period of time, yet had been unable to find
his way back home. It was likely that there were no known
intersections after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, Ji
Ning, Fuxi, Subhuti, and Lord Cui arrived in front of a different
graceful wooden house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Cui waved his
hand, causing a metallic scroll to immediately fly out from inside
the wooden house. The metallic scroll unfurled on its own while
rapidly expanding in size. It hung in the air like an enormous
painting, more than three hundred meters long. It was filled with
countless tiny specks of light, and in the very center of those
countless specks of light there was an enormous, blindingly brilliant
sun-like dot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the star map
we compiled.” Lord Cui pointed towards the giant star map and
smiled. “It holds all the information from the star maps we
acquired from generations of Outsider invaders. During the Primordial
Era, when Mother Nuwa adventured through the primordial chaos, she
encountered an alien Outsider who called himself Chissa. She slew him
and acquired his extremely detailed star map. Most of the information
in the star map we compiled came from this ‘Chissa’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised by
what he saw. This was an extremely detailed star map!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This star map
records a total of twenty-one spacetime transfer arrays, as well as
86,112 chaosworlds.” Lord Cui sighed in amazement. “When I first
found out how many chaosworlds the endless primordial chaos
contained, I was shocked as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than eighty
thousand chaosworlds…and our Three Realms is merely one of the more
remote ones.” Subhuti sighed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was just
surprised at how detailed the star map was. He wasn’t surprised at
the number of chaosworlds, because he had received a similarly
detailed star map from World God Northrest long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This star map has a
total of twenty-one spacetime arrays and more than eighty thousand
star maps. It covers a very large amount of space…but the star map
which World God Northrest gave me doesn’t have any overlapping
stars at all.” Ning mused to himself, “It seems that finding
Vastheaven Palace really will be difficult. Fortunately, I have an
entire chaos cycle to make the attempt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Lord Cui
pointed at an unremarkable speck of gray light located at the very
northernmost part of the map. “That little speck right there
represents our Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s where the
Three Realms are?” Ning was surprised. “Then it should be easy
for us to travel to the other chaosworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Subhuti shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be that
easy.” Fuxi shook his head as well, pointing towards that section
of the star map. “Magnify.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Cui nodded,
causing the star map to be magnified a hundredfold. It became thirty
thousand meters long, and the area including the Three Realms was now
much more easily visible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place holds the
Three Realms.” Fuxi pointed at that gray speck of light. “Ever
since the Primordial Era, the alien Outsiders have only invade from
one direction. All of them came through this ‘spatial vortex’
located right here in order to come to our Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms is
actually located in an extremely dangerous and inhospitable region.
The only way one can reach it is by going through this spatial vortex
here.” Fuxi pointed at another location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a carefully
look while memorizing everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When journeying through
the primordial chaos, finding a safe route by which one could travel
was extremely important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, the fact that
we are surrounded by danger has helped to protect us. It has made it
difficult for alien Outsiders to reach us; they have to risk their
very lives just going through the spatial vortex before they can
reach the Three Realms,” Fuxi said. “This is why we’ve
encountered so very few alien Outsiders since the Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spatial vortex?”
Ning was puzzled. “Did Mother Nuwa leave via this spatial vortex?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Fuxi nodded.
“To reach the Three Realms, you must go through the spatial vortex.
To leave the Three Realms, you also have to travel through the
spatial vortex. If you are able to safely reach the other side, it’ll
be easy for you to travel to the other chaosworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what’s this
enormous, sun-like spot located in the center?” Ning pointed at the
enormous spot of light located in the center of the star map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi, Subhuti, and Lord
Cui all stared at the enormous spot of light, their eyes blazing with
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That? That’s known
as the Badlands Everworld,” Lord Cui said softly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___A_Meeting"></A>
Chapter 4 - A Meeting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands
Everworld?” Ji Ning was secretly surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others in the Three
Realms might not know what the phrase ‘everworld’ truly
represented, but Ning did. World God Northrest’s own ‘Vastheaven
Palace’ resided in an everworld. Every single everworld was a place
which the cultivators of the primordial chaos would be willing to
fight for in an utterly berserk manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Lord Cui
waved his hand again, causing yet another jade slip to fly out from
the wooden room. He handed it straight to Ning. “This holds
everything we know about the outside world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly accepted
it, sweeping it with his coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My oh my.” Ning
took a deep breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things were pretty much
as he had guessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace was
in control of the Vastheaven Everworld, while the Badlands Court was
in control of the Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the detailed
information in the jade slip, Ning was able to estimate roughly how
powerful this force in control of the Badlands Everworld was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
for it to be a force comparable to Vastheaven Palace,” Ning mused
to himself. “In this vast region, at least, the Badlands Everworld
is the center of the universe. Right…in the future, I’ll
definitely have to pay a visit to the Badlands Everworld. I trust
that the powerful experts of the Badlands Everworld, such as its
World Gods or Chaos Immortals, must have journeyed to distant lands.
They might know where Vastheaven Palace is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only Outsiders the
Nuwa Alliance had ever slain were at most at the Elder God or
Ancestral Immortal level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful one
was, the more one would know!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps there were some
within the Badlands Everworld who knew of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finished reading?”
Lord Cui let out a sigh. “According to the information in that
slip, it is very likely that this region contains many World Gods and
Chaos Immortals. Compared to them…those of us in the Three Realms
truly are puny, backwards figures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
every ten chaosworlds would give birth to just one World God! This
was fairly normal. From the vast size of this territory, one could
imagine how many Chaos Immortals and World Gods it held. Still,
precisely because of how vast this territory was, there was no way to
fly or teleport across it. One had to use spacetime transfer arrays
in order to reach certain places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of how vast the
territory was and how many dangerous areas it contained, the various
World Gods and Chaos Immortals were all scattered into many different
regions, causing the territory as a whole to become quite chaotic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In comparison, the
Three Realms could be considered something of a paradise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Godfiend Witherspike
and the Lord of All Fiends, the Three Realms was merely a chaosworld
that was not part of the territory of any World God or Chaos
Immortal. To them, it was like manna from the heavens; of course they
had to do their best to try and take it over! The price of a
Worldheart was far greater than the price of their very lives!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The primordial chaos
truly is endlessly vast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace is
in a different, distant corner of it, but the Badlands Court reigns
supreme here. I wonder how long it will be before I can reach
Vastheaven Palace?” Ning mused silently to himself. “Forget it.
No point worrying about it now. Let’s see if we can even win the
Endwar and if I can even survive it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all boarded the
wooden ship and departed from the Nuwa Immortal Realm. As they did,
Ning continued to ponder to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon learning that
their side had two Elder Gods, Suiren and Gonggong, Ning had
originally grown excited. Now, however, he began to worry a bit. The
Nuwa Alliance was so powerful…how powerful, then, was the Seamless
Gate? It was the Seamless Gate who had instigated the war, after all!
They had launched an attack on the Six Paths of Reincarnation,
causing the Three Realms to be thrown into a state of chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For them to dare do
such a thing…could it be that they didn’t have their own reasons
for feeling confident?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter.
If soldiers attack, let the generals deal with them; if a flood
comes, build earthen ramparts to stop it!” A hint of fierceness
flashed through Ning’s eyes. “We can’t afford to lose this war!
If we lose…even if my daughter and my loved ones survive, they’ll
be chased and attacked and forced into the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they lost the war,
Subhuti would lead the survivors in fleeing! However, Ning knew
exactly how dangerous the primordial chaos was. Even Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals could easily lose their lives wandering through
it. His daughter, Brightmoon, was still too weak. There was no way he
could protect her at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a war between
two great alliances. A war for survival itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before the Endwar
begins, I have to master the Heavenly Dao of Water,” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, where shall
you go to next?” Subhuti looked towards Ning. “Back to the
Crescent world, or…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, I won’t
return to the Crescent world.” Ning shook his head. “I wish to
wander through the Three Realms a bit. I want to see more of the
world, more of Heaven and Earth. I hope to be able to master a
Heavenly Dao before the Endwar begins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Subhuti
smiled and nodded. “Your talent in swordforce is impressive, but if
you wish to become an Elder God or a Daofather you have to first
master a Heavenly Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
parted from Fuxi and Subhuti for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
began to journey through the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, he would sit
on a boat and just watch the waters of the river flow past him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, he would
stand on the peak of a mountain, head raised as he stared at the dark
stormclouds in the skies, presaging the arrival of a rainstorm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, he would
rest within an ancient monastery, watching as storms of rain
descended upon the world outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, he would
soar atop the clouds, watching the waves roll and spin about through
the ocean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water…it could
sometimes be gentle, like a mother’s caress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water…it could be as
cold as ice, capable of chilling you to the bone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water…it could be
utterly devastating, capable of shattering Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water…it could be
joyful, dancing and drifting about the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primaltwin remained
within the Heavengazer Tower, constantly focusing on the Dao. The
true body continued to voyage through the Three Realms, seeing water
in all of its many forms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mist, waves,
glaciers…all of them were water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
relaxing by the side of a river, holding a fishing rod in his hands.
He suddenly revealed a hint of a smile as he tugged at the fishing
rod. Plop! A large fish flew up from the surface of the water,
landing next to him by the side of the river. The white-robed youth
immediately grabbed the fish, then tossed it into the fish bucket
next to him. The bucket already contained six fish inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some fish stew would
be nice.” The white-robed youth rebaited his hook, then flung it
back into the waters of the river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While acting like an
ordinary mortal, fishing and swimming and boating, Ning was able to
discover a different side to water. For ordinary mortals, water was
necessary to life. However, it was also filled with great danger.
Living the life of an ordinary mortal and experiencing water as they
experienced it had caused Ning to gain many more insights….and so
Ning had chosen to live life as an ordinary mortal for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splash, splash. A
distant ferry was slowly crossing from the other side of the river.
This river was very wide, so wide that there were large waves even
when there was no wind. There was a small wind today, and it caused
the waves of the river to grow greater and greater, resulting in the
raft beginning to rock violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of cries could
be heard. The captain of the ferry did his best to keep the boat on
an even keel, but as it continued to rock a young child who was
seated on the ferry fell into the water. Instantly, a nearby
middle-aged man cried out in shock and dove into the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated at the
banks of the river. Upon hearing the distant cries, he raised his
head to take a look. Upon seeing the situation, he let out a soft
sigh and waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a giant,
invisible hand had suddenly lifted the ferry up. Even the middle-aged
man and the child, both of whom were in the water, were lifted up
into the air. The ferry, the child, and the middle-aged man all flew
through the air. They couldn’t help but stare at each other, then
stare at their surroundings in shock and terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ferry, the child,
and the middle-aged man all landed on the other side of the distant
riverbanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Dragon
King!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
great mercy, Dragon King!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ordinary mortals
hurriedly kowtowed towards the water, believing that some great sea
deity had just saved them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, Ning continued to sit there and fish. Suddenly, he couldn’t
help but sigh a little. Life was so fragile and weak. If he hadn’t
just happened to be here, it was likely that many of the passengers
on that ferry would have died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the waters of
the river surged and parted, creating a corridor. A distant wooden
boat sailed through the watery corridor, a red-nosed elder rowing the
boat forward. In a very relaxed fashion, he rowed the boat all the
way over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, long time
no see.” The red-nosed elder chortled as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning revealed a hint
of delight as well as he hurriedly rose to his feet. “I had the
feeling all day long that my luck was pretty good. I managed to catch
six big fish! That’s a lot more than I usually catch. I was
wondering if something was going to happen today, given my luck…but
I didn’t expect to run into you, Old Man Yuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had graced
him with kindness in the past. Not only had he saved Ning, he had
also bequeathed unto Ning the [Heart Sutra].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…the war between
the two alliances had begun, and Old Man Yuan still had yet to choose
a side. Ning couldn’t help but feel a sliver of unhappiness when
seeing the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would you be willing
to board this old man’s boat and chat a bit?” Old Man Yuan asked
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I bring my
fish?” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Old
Man Yuan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning hoisted up his
fish bucket and his fishing rod, then stepped onto Old Man Yuan’s
boat. Old Man Yuan looked at Ji Ning. Ji Ning moved as though he was
an ordinary mortal, but with every movement he radiated a hidden,
reserved power. Old Man Yuan couldn’t help but sigh. “He truly is
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunk. Ning set the
fish bucket down at the prow of the boat, then sat down in the lotus
position facing Old Man Yuan. In front of them was a wooden table,
and on the wooden table was a flask of wine and two winecups.

Chapter 5 - Ji Ning and Old Man Yuan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you deem this old
man worthy, just call me ‘fellow Daoist’,” Old Man Yuan said
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Yuan.”
Ji Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood between the
two was quite subtle and difficult to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The campaign against
the Primordial Ruinworld had already concluded. The Three Realms was
in the midst of the war for karmic luck, and this war was almost
over; the Endwar was going to arrive soon! And yet, Old Man Yuan
still had not chosen to stand alongside the Nuwa Alliance. To tell
the truth…even Ji Ning felt that Old Man Yuan was being a bit too
selfish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, have a bit of
this wine this old man brought.” As Old Man Yuan spoke, he reached
out with his hand, intending to grasp the wine flask. Ning, however,
grabbed it first and smiled at him. “Let me pour.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splash. Splash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning poured two full
cups of wine. Old Man Yuan lifted up his cup, taking a small sip. “I
still remember how young and inexperienced you were. I never would’ve
thought that in less than a thousand years, you would’ve reached
your current level of power. The Seamless Gate truly views you as one
of their major headaches, but they don’t have any method of getting
rid of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
isn’t that powerful.” Ning looked at Old Man Yuan. “In
fact…from the surface, it would seem as though they are weaker than
our side. If that’s true…fellow Daoist Yuan, why are you still
unwilling to join our side? My master Subhuti as well as many other
major powers in the Nuwa Alliance were born alongside you from the
primordial chaos, fellow Daoist Yuan. They are your brothers, and all
of you roamed the Pangu Chaosworld together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they were and
are my lifelong friends.” Old Man Yuan nodded slowly. “But for
the sake of my greater Dao, I’m willing to sacrifice all I have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your ‘greater
Dao’?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My greater Dao
exists in the vast expanse of space outside of this place.” Old Man
Yuan smiled. “The Three Realms is just merely a single small
chaosworld; the outside world holds many more chaosworlds. World Gods
and Chaos Immortals? The vast expanse outside the Three Realms holds
many of them. That is the world which I truly belong to. To risk my
life in a civil war in such a fashion is too pointless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are just
going to watch as your old friends die one by one?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if I do?”
Old Man Yuan was quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood that other major powers such as Patriarch Subhuti had most
likely tried to persuade Old Man Yuan using the same words. Old Man
Yuan remained unpersuaded; clearly, to convince him would be no easy
feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my homeland, we
have a saying: ‘Houses of silver and gold aren’t as good as a
doghouse of your own.’” Ning laughed. “Although this phrase is
quite crude, its meaning is quite simple. It might be true that the
world outside holds more major powers, karmic legacies, techniques,
and divine abilities. The alien Outsiders that invaded the Three
Realms might have been been nothing more than minor figures. But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But no matter how we
weak we are in the Three Realms, this is our doghouse. This is our
home!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can’t
protect our home.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can’t
protect our friends and brothers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the point
of even cultivating?” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan looked at
Ning. “Your words are somewhat reasonable, but as far as I’m
concerned, reaching new heights is what truly matters. When mortals
embark on the Immortal path, some will end up slaying their parents
or their loved ones in under to better understand their own heart! If
I was a mortal who was training to become an Immortal cultivator, I
might very well do the same. Do you understand?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To kill one’s father,
mother, wife, and children to understand one’s own Dao-heart…in
Ning’s eyes, this was a path of evil. If one was without love and
feelings, wouldn’t that just be the same as being a zombie?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who travel on
different paths cannot make plans together.” Ning lifted up his cup
of wine. “Years ago, fellow Daoist Yuan, you bestowed the [Heart
Sutra] upon me. I have nothing which I can use to repay you. All I
can do is offer you this toast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A toast from Sword
Immortal Darknorth? I certainly have to accept it!” Old Man Yuan
raised his own cup as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two both drank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting down his
wine cup, Ji Ning looked at Old Man Yuan. Old Man Yuan couldn’t
help but sigh to himself upon sensing that faint, sharp aura
surrounding Ji Ning. He could sense the tremendous threat which Ji
Ning posed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask why you
have sought me out, fellow Daoist Yuan?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does there have to
be a reason? Can’t we just share some wine and enjoy a chat about
the old days?” Old Man Yuan laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chat about the old
days? Well, we’ve drank our wine and had our chat. I need to go
back and and cook some fish soup.” Ning rose to his feet as he
spoke, reaching towards the fish bucket and the fishing pole which
had been placed at the helm of the boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually do have
something to discuss with you,” Old Man Yuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt and
was about to turn around, but suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange, unfathomable
ripple of power instantly invaded Ning’s body, surging towards his
soul in a massive wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce.” Ning
instantly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way his
own heartforce could defend against that tremendous wave of invading
heartforce power. They were on completely different levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifth stage
heartforce! Old Man Yuan has reached the fifth stage of heartforce.
He just launched a sneak attack against me.” Ning was tremendously
shocked. In the Three Realms, it was common knowledge that the only
person who had reached the fifth stage of heartforce was Houyi.
However, this clearly was not the case. Old Man Yuan was extremely
accomplished in heartforce; the [Heart Sutra] he had bestowed unto
Ning had thoroughly convinced Ning of his formidable prowess in this
field. Only today, however, did he realize that Old Man Yuan had
actually reached the fifth stage of heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s
heartforce flooded through Ning’s body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own heartforce
couldn’t defend against it at all, resulting in the invading
heartforce delving straight towards Ning’s soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce
soul-lock!” Ning had been maintaining this secret art the entire
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce soul-lock
was a type of defensive technique that joined one’s soul and one’s
heartforce together. It was like a series of extremely complicated
‘chains’ that locked them together, making it difficult for an
outside force to break through them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When adventuring
through the primordial chaos, one would often encounter natural
illusions and evil spells that were aimed at the soul. Possessing a
secret art that could protect the soul was extremely important. Thus,
World God Northrest had imparted the ‘heartforce soul-lock’
technique unto Ning! Ning’s soul was nourished by his half-step
Elder God body, resulting in it becoming tremendously powerful. Now
that his soul had been joined together with his fourth-stage
heartforce into a series of complicated interlocking chains, it was
incredibly durable and nearly impregnable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The valiant power
of Old Man Yuan’s fifth-stage heartforce collided violently against
the heartforce soul-lock technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space in the
surrounding area had come to a sudden halt. The waters of the river
had calmed, with not even the tiniest ripple or wave being visible.
It was as though everything had frozen solid. Even the fish within
the fish bucket at the front of the boat had frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wooden boat
suddenly blew apart. The wooden bucket blew apart, with the fish
inside the bucket being completely disintegrated into dust. In fact,
even the surrounding waters of the river were instantly vaporized…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although heartforce was
ephemeral and invisible, fifth-stage heartforce was simply too
terrifyingly powerful. However, it was as though Old Man Yuan’s
heartforce had rammed into a steel board! The defensive prowess of
the heartforce soul-lock technique was simply too formidable, and it
completely defended against Old Man Yuan’s attack. The resulting
spiritual collision actually manifested as an enormous shockwave in
the ‘real’ world, causing everything within ninety meters to be
utterly vaporized. Outside this range, however, nothing was damaged
whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?!” Old Man Yuan revealed a look of shock. This was the
technique which he was the most confident in, but it had failed
spectacularly from the very start.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just turned his
head to look at him, a hint of pain in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Yuan,
you truly disappoint me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed by Old
Man Yuan’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling streak of
sword-light suddenly descended. Ning didn’t hesitate at all,
immediately pulling out and striking down with Violetjewel while
using the most inscrutable, mysterious stance he knew: Shadowless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” A horsetail
whisk appeared in Old Man Yuan’s hands. He flicked it outwards,
causing countless strands of hair to swirl around the sword-light,
blocking it as he hurriedly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You hid your true
power quite well.” As soon as they exchanged blows, Ning discovered
that Old Man Yuan definitely had the power of an overlord-class
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone believed him
to merely be ‘close’ to the overlord level, but that was
something which had been established a long, long time ago. In his
attack against Ning, Old Man Yuan had first revealed his fifth-stage
heartforce, then managed to block Ning’s sword-light with his own
horsetail whisk. Although a soft weapon like this was a natural
counter to Ning’s fierce sword-strikes, Old Man Yuan had still
unquestionably shown himself to be an overlord-class figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
suddenly flashed into existence next to Old Man Yuan. It was an
azure-haired, red-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Lord of All
Fiends!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
shocked by the Lord of All Fiend’s speed. He had actually appeared
without any warning whatsoever!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about leaving!” Ning thrust out with his sword, striking like a
thunderclap. This was the fastest stance he had, the Blood Drop
Stance. He stabbed directly towards Old Man Yuan, but the
azure-haired, red-robed Lord of All Fiends gracefully flew forward at
the same time. As he did, every inch of space around him began to
change and blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts had
exceeded the limits of the Heavenly Daos, and he was using the
fastest stance he had, the Blood Drop Stance. And yet…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared, wide-eyed,
as he realized that his sword couldn’t keep up with the Lord of All
Fiend’s flying speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
and Old Man Yuan disappeared from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
appeared within a palace with Old Man Yuan in tow. Within the hall
were Keeper Everwood, Daomother Devilhand, and the black-robed
Godking. All three turned to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I failed.” Old Man
Yuan shook his head. “He just became a True God; logically
speaking, he would need to spend a long period of time allowing his
soul to be strengthened by his new body. I had thought that his soul
would be fairly weak, making him an easy target. I was hoping to
capture him and use him as proof of my loyalty, but…ugh. I suppose
I really have grown old.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is already
an established power. It won’t be that easy to deal with him. In
truth, there was no need for you to bring some ‘proof of your
loyalty’. I believe you.” The Lord of All Fiends looked at Old
Man Yuan.

Chapter 6 - Buddha Jueming
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the river
began to flow once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there in
midair, a look of anger and pain in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan has
actually, truly joined the Seamless Gate. Didn’t he say that he
doesn’t wish to get involved in the struggles of the Three realms?”
Ning had felt gratitude towards Old Man Yuan. Although Ning felt some
astonishment at the power which Old Man Yuan had revealed, his
primary feeling right now was anguish at the betrayal. His master
Subhuti had been very close to Old Man Yuan; most likely, Subhuti
would be heartbroken as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three figures suddenly
appeared in quick succession next to Ning. First was Subhuti, who
emerged from a spatial vortex. Next was Daoist Three Purities. Last
was Exalted Celestial Carefree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother Yuan
actually…” Exalted Celestial Carefree was trembling, a look of
disbelief in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You still refer to
him as ‘elder brother’?” A fierce, cold light was flickering in
the eyes of Daoist Three Purities. “I truly never imagined that a
traitor would emerge amongst our gang of brothers! If he left the
Three Realms, that would be one thing…but he’s actually joined
the Seamless Gate? Fine. Fine! Subhuti, Zixiu, mark my words well.
From this day forth, Daoist Yuan is our enemy, not our friend!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Exalted
Celestial Carefree nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Traitor.” Subhuti
clenched his jaw, pain visible in his eyes. “I didn’t imagine
this. I never would have imagined this. He told me face-to-face that
he was going to leave the Three Realms…and then he immediately
attacked Ji Ning! Despicable, vile, traitorous wretch!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
looked towards Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti and Old Man
Yuan had originally been extremely close to each other. They were
like true brothers. Daoist Yuan’s betrayal…it probably hurt
Subhuti more than anyone else in the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There will always be
a few black sheep in every flock.” Daoist Three Purities let out a
sigh. “Subhuti, don’t grieve too much for his sake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grieve? No. I won’t
grieve.” Subhuti laughed coldly. “I hope he dies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that
although his master was putting on a stiff upper lift, he was so
angry that his entire body was visibly trembling. Ning understood
just how heavy a blow this had been to his master and so he hurriedly
changed the topic. “Just now, when Daoist Yuan assaulted me, he
used a heartforce technique…which is why I now know that he has
actually reached the fifth stage of heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage of
heartforce?” Three Purities, Subhuti, and Carefree were all
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
sensed the battle which had just occurred, they weren’t able to
notice the heartforce attack from such a great distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, the fifth
stage.” Ning nodded, frowning. “He’s different from senior
apprentice-brother Houyi. Senior apprentice-brother Houyi focuses his
heartforce on his archery, giving his arrows utterly inconceivable
power. Daoist Yuan, however…he uses heartforce in a more mysterious
manner. He was able to weaponize it and use it to directly attack my
soul. Fortunately, my soul was strong enough to resist it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Directly attack the
soul?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That spells
trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti, Three
Purities, and Carefree all understood that this was going to be quite
troublesome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That wretch must’ve
been planning to take advantage of the fact that you just recently
became a True God, Ji Ning.” Subhuti said coldly, “His guess was
that your soul would be fairly weak, as it hadn’t had much time to
be nurtured and strengthened by your True God body. That’s why he
attempted this ambush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He had actually become a True God even before the campaign
against the Primordial Ruinworld, and was a half-step Elder God at
that. His divine body was significantly more powerful than the divine
bodies of most True Gods. Given that he also had the heartforce
soul-lock technique…this time, Daoist Yuan really had rammed into a
steel plate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Yuan…he was
able to defend against Ji Ning’s sword, and his heartforce has
reached the fifth stage.” Daoist Three Purities said in a low
voice, “And he’s also joined the Seamless Gate…his ambitions
must be enormous! Tremendously powerful and incredibly ambitious…we
have to be very wary of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Everyone
present felt heaviness in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt furious
disappointment in the man as well as a deep sense of wariness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had
finally made his choice. He led the Four Ancestors of the River
Source and all of their allies in joining the Seamless Gate. The Four
Ancestors of the River Source and their allies were all completely
loyal to Old Man Yuan. When he had been wavering between the two
sides, the other experts had all chosen to wait for his decision…and
now, they all followed him in joining the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a testament to
how unified a force the Four Ancestors were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
Daoist Yuan is an enemy of the Nuwa Alliance. He is no longer a
friend. Once the Endwar begins, we’ll have to seize every
opportunity possible to kill him.” Daoist Three Purities was
speaking within the Allclans Palace, his words filled with a killing
intent. All of the major powers present fully agreed with his words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yuan’s
betrayal had truly enraged them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Realmwars continued
to proceed unabated within the Three Realms, and the size and scope
of each Realmwar grew larger and larger. A hundred and ten years had
passed after the end of the campaign against the Primordial
Ruinworld, and with each Realmwar both sides would field more than
three thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both alliances could
sense that the end was nigh! The Endwar was about to start at any
moment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t have to
necessarily wait for the war for karmic luck to end…once one side
could sense that there was no longer any hope of winning the war for
karmic luck, it was entirely possible that they would launch the
Endwar early.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mood in both
alliances was quite depressed as a result! Everyone was preparing for
the final battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Realm.
Mount Ling in the eastern lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a pair of
Buddhist novitiates standing guard before an ordinary-looking hall
here. Within the hall was Buddha Jueming, who was seated there
completely unmoving like a statue. He was in complete solitude,
without any sign of life about him at all. It was as though he was a
corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The statue-like Buddha
Jueming suddenly opened his eyes in a very, very slow manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Realmwar over
the Shennong major world has begun?” Buddha Jueming murmured softly
to himself, “The flames of war have filled the entire Three Realms.
Even the Shennong major world has been embroiled into war. It has
only been a hundred and fifty years since the war against the
Primordial Ruinworld. Things are progressing too quickly. If this
continues…the end to the war for karmic luck shall arrive in a few
scant decades.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final battle for
karmic luck would result in all of the Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals in both alliances engaging in one final clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When this happened, all
of the powerful Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms aside
from the True Gods and Daofathers would be dragged into the battle.
If one side felt that things were going poorly, the True Gods and
Daofathers might directly intervene, resulting in the Endwar
beginning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within fifty years…”
Buddha Jueming slowly rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifty years was a
fairly loose estimate. If things progressed quickly within the
Shennong major world, for example, it was entirely possible that the
final battle for karmic luck would conclude in ten or twenty years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lifeblood oath I
swore was to leave the Three Realms within a thousand years of
becoming an Elder God and go search for Vastheaven Palace.” Buddha
Jueming murmured to himself, “The Endwar could break out at any
moment now…and I need time to break through from the True God level
to the Elder God level. If I wait for the Endwar to actually begin
before making my breakthrough, I’ll just be delaying the
inevitable. Mmm…let it begin now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming
disappeared from the hall, with the two Buddhist novitiates being
none the wiser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a black star
located deep in the endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous Buddhist
lotus flower had descended upon the surface of this star, and seated
in the lotus position atop it was Buddha Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
around the area suddenly began to writhe. Even the stellar energy of
the black star was being ravenously devoured as everything in the
area began to swirl around Buddha Jueming. Enormous amounts of energy
were being frantically pulled towards him, forming an enormous
swirling maelstrom of primordial chaos! As for Buddha Jueming, every
single speck of divine power in his body began to transform and be
remade anew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the vortex of primordial chaos dissipated. Everything became calm
again, and the black star once more regained its normal aura of
grandeur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of sadness could
be seen in the eyes of Buddha Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve become an
Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A thousand years
from now, I must leave the Three Realms.” Buddha Jueming was filled
with a deep reluctance to part with the Three Realms. He had started
as a weak mortal and had slowly risen to power here. He had made
miracles happen in Undermoon Lake and as a result had been awarded
the [Solitary World God]. After so many years of training in it, he
had long ago found the necessary spark of insight within his divine
body. He was able to break through from being a True God to being an
Elder God whenever he chose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he truly
didn’t wish to leave. He had a gentle disposition and was innately
suited for the Buddhist Sangha. He had no great desires or ambitions;
he was quite satisfied with living a peaceful life in the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, now that the
Endwar was arriving, he had to stand up and step forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by becoming an
Elder God would he be strong enough to have an impact on the outcome
of the war. However…becoming an Elder God meant he would have to
leave the Three Realms within a thousand years. If he did not, his
lifeblood oath would rebound against him and destroy his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to do
battle alongside Master and my old friends against a common enemy…it
is enough that I can do this before leaving.” Buddha Jueming sat
down on his lotus flower, once more disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew of his
breakthrough in the endless primordial chaos, and he quietly slipped
back into his own hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only people present
in his hall were those two Buddhist novitiates. He was a low-key
figure who never left his palace. Much like Suiren, he used a
technique which withdrew and suppressed his aura. Even if someone
came to visit him, they probably wouldn’t be able to tell that he
had changed. Given how tense the situation was with the Endwar ready
to erupt at any moment, no one would come pay a visit, especially
since Buddha Jueming was so low-key and spent all of his time in
solitary meditation after becoming a True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one in the Three
Realms knew that a new Elder God had just been born.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet little
mountain village. This village was a peaceful, calm place. There was
an ordinary bamboo house located in the middle of it, and there was a
white-robed youth who lived within this house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other villagers
were all actually quite curious about this youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the people in
this village were ordinary mortal refugees who had fled to the depths
of this mountain and built homes here. Thus, very few people knew
each other. The white-robed youth had travelled alongside them and
established a residence here as well. They had thought that the
white-robed youth was a refugee like them…but then the white-robed
youth had lived with them for five full years. During these five
years, they noticed that the white-robed youth spent almost every day
fishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t chase after
pretty lasses, nor did he worry about starting a family, nor did he
tend to any fields.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he did was fish. He
relied on fishing to make his living.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid really
doesn’t know what’s good for him. I tried to propose a wife for
him, but he refused to hear of it. Old Li’s daughter is so pretty,
and her family is a fine one! She’s one of the top two eligible
maidens in our village. It’s rare for anyone to catch her fancy
like he did, but all he did was smile and refuse…” The matchmaker
granny grumbled as she walked out of the bamboo house. She even gave
the bamboo door a hard kick as she left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this old granny knew
that she had just kicked at the door of one of the most supreme
Fiendgods of the entire Three Realms…what would her reaction be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
chuckled as he stood there next to the bamboo door, then grabbed his
fishing pole and once more headed out to go fishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In previous years, he
had wandered the Three Realms. Recently, however, he had chosen to
merge into the ranks of commoners and live life alongside them. This
actually resulted in Ning slowly gaining insights into a different
aspect of the nature of water. In the mortal world, there was a
saying that ‘water was life’. Water could lift up a boat, but it
could also capsize it. Ning could vaguely sense a profound truth
pertaining to the vast Heavenly Dao of Water…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Just as Ning
picked up the fishing pole, he came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
finished refitting my divine ability.” Ning revealed a hint of
delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning soared into the
skies, instantly disappearing into the horizons. However, none of the
villagers were able to see this. They only saw the white-robed youth
pick up his fishing pole and head off to go fishing. They had no idea
that only an incarnation had been left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere atop a tattered, damaged star located deep in the Void of the
Three Realms. As he descended upon the star, some dust was kicked up
and sent flying into the endless Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll train in the
[Starseizing Hand] here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then waved
his hand. The dust on the ground was all swept up together, then
solidified into a stone boulder than landed next to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position atop the stone boulder. Waving his hand, he produced a
gourd. This gourd was filled with Five Elements essence, the essence
that he had acquired from breaking down Pure Yang treasures and
Protocosmic spirit-treasures in the Prisonworld through his Five
Elements Cauldron. Ning needed to use the Five Elements essence to
train the [Starseizing Hand] to the Sixth Cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sixth Cycle of the
[Starseizing Hand] was incredibly hard to train in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives had
been lucky eough to acquire a piece of golden starstone which held
certain divine runes within it. After spending a long period of time
analyzing it, he had used the golden starstone as well as many other
supplementary materials to master the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand]. The only other person who had ever acquired golden starstone
aside from Daoist Threelives was Daoist Three Purities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Daoist Three
Purities had used the piece he acquired as a component of his
Immortal Slaying Swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal Slaying
Swords were based off of his insights into the Nine Chaos Seals.
Countless precious materials had been consumed in their creation, and
the four Chaos-level swords were like a single weapon that could be
joined together to unleash utterly terrifying devastation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden
starstone…this should have been the ‘Starheart’ item which
World God Northrest’s records mentioned. It’s quite impressive
that the denizens of the Three Realms managed to find two such
items.” Ning shook his head. Without golden starstone, there was no
way he could master the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had begun to focus
on researching and analyzing this technique. To Ning, upgrading his
hands to become Chaos-level treasures wasn’t that important,
because he already had real Chaos-level treasures. In fact,
Violetjewel was far more powerful than Chaos treasures! The real
reason why Ning cared about the [Starseizing Hand] was because when
it unleashed its full power, he would be able to deliver blows of
utterly tremendous power that vastly surpassed his ordinary level of
strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives
wasn’t that talented in comprehending the Dao; he hadn’t even
mastered a single Heavenly Dao. However, thanks to the [Starseizing
Hand], he had been able to valiantly slay multiple alien True Gods
and Daofathers in the war that had ended the Primordial Era!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
was ranked by Three Purities as one of the top ten divine abilities
of the Three Realms, on par with [Houyi’s Archery]. This was
precisely because it could unleash utterly shocking levels of power!
Unfortunately, Daoist Threelives himself wasn’t that innately
powerful; if he was a half-step Elder God like Ji Ning, he definitely
would’ve been able to reach the overlord level of power with just
the [Starseizing Hand]! Ning was in bad need of a technique which
would allow him to explosively increase his level of power. Although
he had the [Nine Elements Annihilation], he would need a long period
of time before being able to develop a powerful divine ability of his
own from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
naturally possessed formidable techniques that allowed for an
explosive increase in power, but all of them had come from Vastheaven
Palace and could not be taught to outsiders! Over the course of his
many years of adventure, he had acquired a few similar techniques,
but alas all of them were fairly mediocre. Although he had passed
them on to Ning, none of them could match the Sixth Cycle of the
[Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sixth Cycle of
the [Starseizing Hand] was developed by Daoist Threelives after he
meditated on a piece of golden starstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…the way in
which he caused his divine power to explode out was excessively
violent! My palms would first have to first be refined to become
Chaos treasures; otherwise, there’s no way they would be able to
withstand such tremendous power,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
allowed for an incredibly forceful increase in power. This meant that
the palms had to be made incredibly sturdy; only then would they be
able to endure this level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a
hundred and seventy-two years since I became a True God. My
Primaltwin has spent a total of more than seventeen thousand years in
the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance,” Ning mused to himself.
“Although I’ve mainly focused on comprehending the Dao and only
occasionally spent time on my sword-arts and divine abilities, I was
still able to finish retrofitting the [Starseizing Hand].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the [Nine
Elements Annihilation] as his foundation, he had carefully
restructure and remade the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mysteries of the
[Starseizing Hand] actually came from some of the profound secrets
contained within that piece of golden starstone. The construction of
the [Starseizing Hand] technique itself wasn’t that complicated.
With the [Nine Elements Annihilation] serving as a reference guide,
Ning was able to completely deconstruct it, then slowly rebuild and
postulate a new Sixth Cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This process took more
than seventeen thousand years…but now, the Primaltwin had finally
mastered it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This new technique
allowed for the use of Five Elements essence to replace golden
starstone and the other precious materials needed to refine the hands
and make them into Chaos treasures. The fundamental underpinnings of
the [Starseizing Hand] was to use Five Elements treasures to refine
the hands, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus together, a gourd placed next to him which was filled with Five
Elements essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Ning’s
guidance, the Five Elements essence soared towards his twin palms.
The divine Starseizing Tattoos appeared on his hands, and they
quickly began to grow more and more complicated. Finally, the tattoos
reached a new peak of power, causing Ning to feel as though they were
bursting with power. His hands began to emanate an aura of limitless
might. However, Ning had long ago set up a barrier of heartforce
around the area, preventing anyone from investigating it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate knew
that Ji Ning was on this star, but they had no way of looking into
what Ji Ning was doing here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
willed the absolutely dominating aura of power radiating from his
hands to be suppressed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My hands are now
comparable to Chaos treasures. They are now strong enough to
withstand an explosion of divine power.” Ning willed the divine
ability active as he struck out towards the Void with his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
semi-translucent palm smashed through the Void, causing space itself
to shudder and ripple. An enormous Voidwave that was a hundred
million kilometers in size blasted forward, heading off to who-knows
where.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power.” Ning nodded, revealing a look of delight. This sort of
explosive power, when combined with Violetjewel, would become even
more formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine ability
has been completed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, the only thing
I am lacking…is in my insights into the Dao! I hope that before the
Endwar begins, I’ll be able to master a Heavenly Dao.” Ning felt
a hint of worry. He had left one of his incarnations in Allclans
Palace, which was why he knew exactly what the situation was like in
the Three Realms. Things were truly at the tipping point now; the
Endwar could start at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Endwar
occurred only after the war for karmic luck ended, that meant it was
only a few decades away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, the more you
try to force something to happen, the harder it will be for you to
succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
principle very well. He deeply desired to master a Heavenly Dao, and
he had made tremendous progress during the past seventeen thousand
years in understanding the Heavenly Dao of Water, but he knew that
the more impatient he felt the more it would hinder him in actually
mastering the Dao. Thus, Ning remained very calm. He acted the same
as he always had, and he would also take rests to go meditate on his
sword-arts and other techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he hadn’t
mastered a Heavenly Dao during the past period of time, he had
upgraded the [Starseizing Hand] and had improved tremendously in
sword-arts as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
mastered ninety-six of the ninety-eight techniques on those stone
sword-steles. Only two more techniques remain. I need just a little
more time. Once I master them, I can begin to meditate on the
[Nameless] sword-art.” Within the Heavengazer Tower, the
black-robed Ning was staring at the two final stone steles in front
of him.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 - Nameless Sword-Art, ‘Heartsword Stance’
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji Ning
stretched out a finger. A rainbow-colored sword materialized out of
nowhere, which he then began to use to execute sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-shadows
flowed through the air, as illusory as dreams. It was as though
rainwater had appeared throughout the area, with an occasional hint
of sharpness appearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Ning had a
puzzled look on his face as he began training. However, a look of
delight slowly began to appear on his face. In fact, he began to let
out cries of delight and amazed sighs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light flashed
one final time before disappearing into the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fine [Hidden
Edge] technique.” Ning came to a halt, unable to disguise the
excitement in his eyes. “World God Northrest truly went all out in
his efforts to guide me forward on my path. Each of these
ninety-eight stone steles have led me forward, step by step, to gain
more and more insights into the sword. I am becoming an increasingly
suitable candidate for training in the [Nameless] sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of these stone
steles focused on hiding one’s sharpness. I’ve now thoroughly
mastered them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninety-eight
stone steles…I’ve mastered them all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and the jade shrine instantly appeared next to him. He entered the
jade shrine, and as he did he looked at the countless sword-diagrams
that were drawn onto the walls of the shrine. These diagrams recorded
the most important technique which World God Northrest had ever
possessed…the [Nameless] sword-art. Even someone like World God
Northrest had only been capable of merely memorizing all of the
techniques; he was only able to actually master a portion of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Being able to memorize
something didn’t mean that you could truly understand and master
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
for example, had been able to memorize all nine of the Nine Chaos
Seals. However, when he fashioned the Immortal Slaying Swords, he had
only been able to understand seven of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Nameless]
sword-art is completely focused on the true essence of the sword,”
Ning said softly. “According to what World God Northrest
said…someone who masters this technique has a chance of mastering
the sixth stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stage of
swordforce was the ‘Sword World’ stage. This was a stage of true
perfection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a Fiendgod could
truly reach this stage of power, then one could use the ‘Sword
World’ to serve as the core of the body and remake it to become a
World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a Ki Refiner was to
reach this stage of power, the ‘Sword World’ could be used as the
nucleus for causing the Jindan region inside the body to be remade
into primordial chaos anew, allowing him to step into the Chaos
Immortal level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Sword World’
realm was a level of mastery that was on the same level as the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Dao of
Primordial Chaos was one of the most commonly seen Heavenly Daos.
According to what World God Northrest said, more than 99% of World
Gods and Chaos Immortals had reached that level through mastering the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos! This was because the primordial
chaos itself existed in all things. It didn’t matter what Heavenly
Dao you meditated on; once you started training in any Heavenly Dao,
such as the Heavenly Dao of Water you would also be able to begin
training in the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
could be divided into the duality of Yin and Yang. It could also be
divided into the essence of life and the essence of destruction, or
the Five Elements of metal, wood, water, fire, earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you trained in any
of the other nine Heavenly Daos you trained it, you were also
training in the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos! This was why only
Daofathers were able to draw upon the energy of primordial chaos and
able to train in that Dao. As a result, World Gods and Chaos
Immortals who reached that level through understanding the Heavenly
Dao of Primordial Chaos were extremely, extremely common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for reaching that
level through understanding the true essence of the Sword and
reaching the ‘Sword World’ stage? Very, very few World Gods and
Chaos Immortals had ever done so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, every single
World God and Chaos Immortal who had reached that level through
mastery of the ‘Sword World’ stage was an incredibly powerful
figure with shocking offensive capabilities! Ordinary Chaos Immortals
and World Gods simply couldn’t compete with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each stage of
swordforce was a hundred times more difficult to master than the
last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To advance from the
first stage to the second stage was fairly easy, and to reach the
third stage wasn’t that hard either. The fourth stage, however, was
extremely difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for reaching the
fifth stage of ‘Sword God’, the number of people in the Three
Realms who had ever succeeded in doing so could be counted on one
hand. More people had become ‘overlords’ than reach the Sword God
stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for advancing to the
sixth stage of ‘Sword World’…this would be even more difficult,
far more so than ‘merely’ becoming a World God or Chaos Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Nameless]
sword-art, however, is a technique that guides me straight to the
essence of the sword itself, a peerless sword-art that can allow the
user to reach the ‘Sword World’ stage.” Ning stared at the
sword-stances recorded on the walls of the jade shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nameless]
sword-art as recorded before him had a total of seven stances! This
was, of course, just part of the real technique; it was so incomplete
that World God Northrest himself didn’t even know the actual name
of this sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
himself had only mastered five stances! However, so long as one could
master the third stance, one would be able to reach the ‘Sword
World’ stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about three
stances. This first stance alone…if I can master it, my chances in
the Endwar will become much greater.” Ning stared at the walls of
the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning could master
even just the first stance, then in terms of pure sword-arts it would
be almost impossible for him to find an equal who was not a World God
or Chaos Immortal. Far less than one in ten thousand Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals would possess an equal level of skill in the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
carefully inspected the jade shrine, meditating on the first stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those ninety-eight
stone sword-steles existed for the purpose of molding him to become a
good candidate for training in the first stance. Without those
ninety-eight sword-arts, just glancing at the first stance would
probably result in Ning suffering injuries and vomiting up blood.
However, now that he had mastered the ninety-eight sword-arts,
Ning…still found it incredibly hard to understand the first stance
of the [Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heartsword
stance…b-but…how can the very first stance of the [Nameless]
sword-art be so ephemeral, arcane, and unfathomably profound?” Ning
simply couldn’t understand the countless sword-stances that had
been engraved on the walls of the shrine, and in truth they were just
samples for Ning to inspect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartsword stance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had no stances. It
was a sword of the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all his years of
training, Ning had always used the sword in his hand to do battle!
The [Brightmoon] sword-art’s ‘Soleheart’ stance, ‘Blood Drop’
stance, ‘Heavenbreaker’ stance, ‘Shadowless’ stance, and
‘Yin-Yang’ stance were all stances that could be seen with the
naked eye. The ‘Heartsword’ stance of the [Nameless] sword-art,
however, didn’t have any actual stances to it at all. This made it
incredibly hard for Ning to comprehend it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could catch vague
glimpses of the nature of this sword-art, but actually training in it
remained incredibly hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…he could sense
that one he mastered it, he would have reached a completely different
realm of using the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training in it
for roughly five years, Ning came to a halt and instead once more
turned to mastering the Heavenly Dao of Water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training in the sword.
Meditating on the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He alternated between
the two. Although the flames of the Endwar were growing increasingly
visible, Ning remained calm as he trained in solitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms was in
a state of complete chaos now. Both sides had finished their
preparations and were ready for the Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming and
others like him who had been hiding their true power had finished
their preparations as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allfiend world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Realmwar going
on in the Shennong world went on for nine years. In the end, we still
lost.” The seated Daofather Ink Bamboo’s voice was filled with
worry. “Fiendlord, didn’t you say that we have a grand army of
bugbeasts? Why is it that our bugbeast army never made an appearance
during the Shennong Realmwar?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
was seated in the highest position. He smiled as he looked at
Daofather Ink Bamboo. “Ink Bamboo, no need to be impatient. We need
to keep our eye on the bigger picture. If we lost, we lost. It
doesn’t matter. We’ve still been able to preserve the bulk of our
forces, ensuring that our losses weren’t too heavy. As for the
bugbeast army…of course we still have it. However, we can have it
make its appearance during the very end of the war for karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, do we
actually have a bugbeast army?” The nearby Daomother Devilhand
immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do.” The Lord
of All Fiends nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that none
of us have ever heard about it? You’ve only mentioned it a short
while ago.” Daomother Devilhand was quite dubious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was just keeping
it a secret from everyone.” The Lord of All Fiends swept the group
with his gaze. “Today, a major power of the Seamless Gate has
returned to us. Just wait a short while and you will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major power has
returned?” Everyone present was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t all of our
major powers already here in the Three Realms?” The black-robed
Godking was the most puzzled of them all. All of their formidable
Elder Gods had perished during the war that ended the Primordial Era;
the powerful figures who survived, such as Daomother Devilhand or
Keeper Everwood, were all in the Three Realms. How could a major
power have ‘made a return’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know
shortly.” The Lord of All Fiends had a smile on his face. Although
they had been defeated in the Shennong Realmwar, he was still in
quite a good mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other ten-plus
major powers present had no choice but to wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly an hour later,
a figure suddenly appeared before the palace then stepped inside it.
This man was half bald, and his eyes seemed naturally and perpetually
filled with malice and viciousness. As he walked in, he immediately
and excitedly knelt down with respect. “Your disciple greets you,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for this.”
The Lord of All Fiends reached out with his hand, sending out a surge
of divine power and pressing upwards at the man’s knee, making him
rise. “Disciple, you’ve had to toil away all by yourself for so
many years. Master should be the one expressing gratitude to you. In
addition, you are now as strong as an Elder God yourself. There’s
no need for you to kneel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without you, Master,
I would’ve died long ago when I was an ordinary mortal.” The
savage balding man said respectfully, “No matter what happens, you
shall always be my master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his favorite
disciple, and the disciple he trusted the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stoneswan!?!” The
black-robed Godking rose to his feet, staring at the man in
disbelief. “Y-you…didn’t die?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t died
either, Clothred. How could I?” The man laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windfiend, did you
just say that Bloodswan has become comparable to an Elder God? He’s
an overlord?” Daomother Devilhand was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
nodded. “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Keeper
Everwood began to laugh. “When you saved us all, Windfiend, you
journeyed by yourself through the endless primordial chaos for a long
time, only releasing us when you returned to the Three Realms. You
told us that your disciple, Daofather Bloodswan, ended up dying in
the primordial chaos. So that was just a lie you told us.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I fled from the
Three Realms,” the Lord of All Fiends said with a sigh, “I found
myself lost within the vast primordial chaos. I had no idea where I
was supposed to go, so I randomly chose a direction and started to
move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, the Lord of
All Fiends didn’t have any detailed star maps; he had no idea that
a spatial vortex tunnel existed which led out of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The endless
primordial chaos is filled with countless dangers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was very lucky in
that I am skilled in staying alive, and I was also quite careful.
That’s the only reason I was able to survive for so long.
Otherwise, I would’ve died there long ago.” As the Lord of All
Fiends spoke, the other major powers all listened to him. In the
past, he had never been willing to divulge anything pertaining to his
experiences wandering the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, I was
lucky enough to encounter an estate that should have been left behind
by some ancient, powerful figure.” The Lord of All Fiends
continued, “I even discovered an entire major world there. I
imagine that only World Gods and Chaos Immortals are capable of
establishing a major world within the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofathers of the
Three Realms were generally capable of establishing major worlds, but
that was only within the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those created major
worlds depended on the Worldheart of the Three Realms to exist.
Without the Worldheart, the entire Three Realms would collapse and
fall apart. The Crimsonbright world, the Xuanwu world, the Crescent
world…none of them could survive on their own. The ruinous power of
the primordial chaos would destroy everything! To build a major world
within the primordial chaos was incredibly difficult. Some
particularly formidable Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals might be
capable of it, but less than one in ten thousand would have that
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju, for
example, was strong enough to do so, but that was only because he had
been possessed by World God Northrest, who stood at the very highest
peak of power amongst World Gods. That was why he had been able to
establish Undermoon Lake with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it was a
major world, it was still just a few tens of millions of kilometers
around; hardly enough for all of us to survive and flourish,” the
Lord of All Fiends said. “When I adventured through the primordial
chaos, Bloodswan travelled by my side as we risked our lives
together. He took a liking to that estate world, preferring it to the
Three Realms. Thus, he decided to take up residence there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I decided to stay
there with him. Every so often, I’d go back to take a look at the
Three Realms. When I did, I did it in a way that ensured that Nuwa
wouldn’t notice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, the day
came when Nuwa left the Three Realms. I waited a fairly long period
of time after she left before returning to the Three Realms with all
of you in tow. By then the Nuwa Alliance clearly no longer wished to
battle with us, and so they let us back inside.” The Lord of All
Fiends laughed. “Afterwards, we ended up finding Blackheaven! I
acquired his golem-making skills as well as certain techniques that
could be used for rearing bugbeasts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The art of
golem-making requires many skilled artificers, but the art of rearing
bugbeasts does not. The only thing you need is time; given enough
time, the bugbeasts will naturally grow and evolve.” The Lord of
All Fiends laughed. “And so, I let Bloodswan help me out. For all
these countless years, Bloodswan has been training in that
estate-world in the primordial chaos. In doing so, he also kept an
eye on my bugbeasts. Last time, when I paid him a visit, I realized
that he reached the overlord level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I always felt that
Bloodswan was a determined and decisive man.” Keeper Everwood
nodded. “When I heard that you lost your life while adventuring in
the primordial chaos alongside your master, I felt saddened for a
long period of time. Now that I know that you are still alive, I’m
absolutely delighted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodswan,
congratulations.” Daomother Devilhand looked at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Devilhand was known by
all as a devil amongst devils. Of the mortal geniuses who had risen
to prominence in the Seamless Chaosworld, the one she had favored the
most was Bloodswan! Bloodswan was a true devil as well. However, he
was an excessively solitary figure who hated the company of others.
During the era of the Seamless Chaosworld, the black-robed Godking
and Bloodswan had been considered equals amongst the younger
generation of cultivators. The Godking had became apprenticed to
Demonheart, whereas Bloodswan had decided to join the equally
solitary Windfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The Godking
felt aggrieved and stifled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood and
Daomother Devilhand had long ago stood at the very peak of power in
the Seamless Chaosworld. Bloodswan, however, had grown up at the same
time that the Godking had. He had always treated Bloodswan as a
rival, but a rival who he had always been superior to! But now,
Bloodswan had actually become an overlord? This caused him to feel
extremely unhappy. Bloodswan’s original name was Stoneswan, and he
had been on fairly good terms with the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, eventually
they parted ways due to their different temperaments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both were devils! The
former delighted in toying with the hearts of others, while the other
was an extremely solitary who abstained from the rest of the world,
holding all in contempt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Daofather
Bloodswan said respectfully, “I’ve returned before the Endwar as
promised. However, after this war concludes, I intend to head towards
that spatial vortex tunnel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
also acquired a number of star maps and thus knew about the existence
of the spatial vortex tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew we wouldn’t
be able to keep you forever.” The Lord of All Fiends nodded.
“Indeed, only by passing through that tunnel shall you be able to
enter the vaster world outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Daofather
Bloodswan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
now felt even more unhappy. This solitary idiot was now putting on
airs of ‘wanting to visit the greater world’? He, the Godking,
was planning to become the leader of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stoneswan.” The
black-robed Godking forced out a laugh, managing to make it sound
very genuine and loud. “Now that you’ve become an overlord, our
side has gained yet another powerful combatant. However, I need to
warn you that your information might be a bit out of date. The Nuwa
Alliance has gained another extremely formidable combatant as
well…Sword Immortal Darknorth, Ji NIng. He has trained for less
than a thousand years but has already become an overlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Bloodswan’s
eyes lit up. “He’s that incredible? The chance to face an
opponent like him is truly exciting.” His eyes were actually
turning slightly bloodshot with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shennong world’s
Realmwar had come to an end!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides began to
mobilize their armies in their various major worlds and Realms as
they gathered their forces….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the battle
for the Deerchaser major world, the Nuwa Alliance’s morale had been
sky-high. They won most of the remaining Realmwars, and they had also
won the recently-concluded Shennong Realmwar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Humanworld of Yu
the Great. The Allclans Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various major
powers had all gathered together here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has begun to mobilize their forces spread throughout their worlds.”
Daoist Three Purities was seated up high as he spoke in an icy voice.
“Clearly, their many defeats have caused them to grow anxious. They
wish to gather their remaining forces and launch the final battle for
karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major powers
seated below him felt their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Had the day finally
arrived?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they wish to
fight, then let us fight. Fight them to the death. Fight them to
their deaths!” Exalted Celestial Thundergod crushed the winecup in
his hands as he bellowed loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though they
have allied with the Primordial Ruinworld, they still are not a match
for us.” Houyi, also seated in one of the high seats, spoke in a
calm voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Either they die or
we die. There are no other choices. We have only one option before
us: To completely wipe them all out!” Kuafu bellowed in an even
louder voice than Thundergod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the more
irascible Fiendgods present felt their blood begin to boil. Ning’s
own eyes flashed with sharp light as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nothing in the world
would ever proceed exactly as planned or desired! Still…it didn’t
matter. He had already mastered his [Starseizing Hand] and had
dramatically improved his sword-arts. It was more than enough for him
to go to the field of battle and slaughter his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By my decree,”
Daoist Three Purities boomed out, “All major powers shall mobilize
their armies of Immortals and Fiendgods and send them to the
Humanworld of Yu the Great. Prepare for the final battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing light flashed
through the eyes of all the major powers. This was total war.
Personal survival no longer mattered. They knew that even if they
were able to win this war, it was very likely that many of them would
perish in the process. It was likely that many of their old friends
would perish before everything was said and done. Perhaps they
themselves would also pass away. And so…their only choice was to
kill! To kill as many of the foes as they could so that more of their
friends would be able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By my word, everyone
is to immediately assemble at the Crimsonbright major world.” In
the Grand Xia, the Xia Emperor was giving an order to the many
Immortals and Fiends who had assembled before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies above the
Grand Xia Palace split asunder, revealing an enormous passageway. The
many Immortals and Fiendgods all entered the passageway, heading
towards the Crimsonbright world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the armies under
the command of the Crimsonbright Realm were mobilizing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After assembling at the
Crimsonbright world, they would head together to the Humanworld of Yu
the Great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms
shuddered as the flames of war burned ever brighter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, his
true body remained within that mountain village of mortals. The
village remained as calm as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They probably have
no idea.” Ning was seated by the side of a pond, fishing rod in
hand. He turned his head to stare at the chimney smoke coming from
the distant mountain village, then let out a sigh. “A great battle
is about to begin…and this battle may well impact every single
major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the final,
life-and-death struggle between the two major alliances. Both sides
would hold back and do their best not to wreck the Three Realms, but
some collateral damage was unavoidable. It was also possible that
when one side saw no hope of victory, it might decide to wreck the
Three Realms out of spite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Water flows on in a
turbulent stream, capable of supporting a boat but also capable of
capsizing it. But if the boat is too big…the water can only
endure…” Ning was murmuring to himself, but he suddenly came to a
halt as a light flashed in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies above Ning
suddenly began to shudder as the aura of the Heavenly Daos descended
upon the village pond, causing all of the denizens of the village to
stare in utter terror. Faced with the terrifying aura of the Heavenly
Daos, they all uncontrollably fell to their knees. Right at this
moment, they saw the white-robed youth suddenly soar into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing loudly, Ji
Ning tossed the fishing rod aside and soared into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Immortal!!!”
The village dwellers all repeatedly pressed their heads against the
ground.

Chapter 10 - The Prisoners of the Prison World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
descended upon a tattered star located deep within the primordial
chaos. He sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
manifested above him, forming into an enormous whirlpool of energy
that completely surrounded Ning, furiously surging into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one broke through
to become a Celestial Immortal or Pure Yang True Immortal, one would
absorb elemental energy or energy from Immortal pills! However, now
that Ning had mastered the Heavenly Dao of Water, he also gained
partial insight into the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos. The former
was part of the latter, after all. Thus, Ning was now naturally
capable of drawing energy from the primordial chaos, resulting in a
seemingly endless flood of energy flooding into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Pure Yang Jindan
began a new evolution, and the Immortal energy within his body began
to transform on a fundamental level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Heavenly Dao
of Water serving as the core of his Dao, he began to absorb more and
more chaos energy while converting it for his own use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world,
atop an island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
walked out of his Immortal estate. Uncle White, located outside the
estate, glanced at Ning and smiled at him. “Ning, son, you’ve
come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to make a
trip.” Ning smiled back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
immediately soared into the skies. A moment later, yet another streak
of light flew towards him. This was the Primaltwin which had been
protecting his daughter the entire time. The Primaltwin immediately
flew into the black-robed Ning’s estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, the backup
Primaltwin clone was going to make the breakthrough as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
sat down in the lotus position atop a distant, desolate island, then
began to draw upon the energy of the primordial chaos. Instantly, a
vortex of chaos energy began to appear in the air above the barren
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body, his
backup true body clone, his Primaltwin, his backup Primaltwin
clone…all of them began to make their breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His backup true body
clone made its breakthrough within the prisonworld. It too chose to
use the Heavenly Dao of Water to serve as its core as it began to
draw upon the energy of primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning mastered the
Heavenly Dao of Water, a resonance was suddenly formed with the
Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another major
power has mastered the Heavenly Dao of Water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who mastered it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other major powers
of the Three Realms who had also mastered the Heavenly Dao of Water
were the first to react. Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Suiren, and the
others who had mastered the Heavenly Dao of Water could also sense
the resonance with the Heavenly Daos. Soon, they discovered that the
person who had caused this major disturbance through his breakthrough
was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Sword
Immortal Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…Darknorth has
finally mastered a Heavenly Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance all laughed and rejoiced. None of them were surprised
at all, because Ji Ning’s attainments in the sword were simply far,
far too exemplary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that the
Heavenly Daos were vast and profound. Normally speaking, mastering a
Heavenly Dao would take an incredibly long period of time; for
someone like Ji Ning who had trained for a bit over a thousand years
to succeed in doing so was a ridiculous concept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ji Ning was
someone who had spent less than a thousand years to become an
overlord! They weren’t surprised at all that he was now able to
master a Heavenly Dao as well. But of course, they had no idea that
Ji Ning had actually used roughly twenty thousand years in order to
master a Heavenly Dao. Still…to master a Heavenly Dao in twenty
thousand years was almost inconceivably fast, something which was
rarely seen even in the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main palace
of the Allfiend world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was Sword
Immortal Darknorth who made the breakthrough.” Daofather Ink Bamboo
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he really didn’t
master the Heavenly Dao of Water before this.” Daomother Devilhand
frowned as well. “It seems that before this, he was completely
focused on the path of the sword! Just by relying on his skills with
the sword and his True God body, he was able to unleash the power of
an overlord. In fact, he was able to fight Godfiend Witherspike to a
standstill. Even his body is comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasure. What the hell type of cultivation path has Ji Ning
been walking?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s mastered a
Heavenly Dao, but his insights into the Heavenly Dao of Water are far
inferior to his insights into the sword,” Keeper Everwood said.
“He’s always been weaker as a Ki Refiner. He might be a Daofather
now, but it won’t make much of a difference.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Darknorth’s power lies in his close combat ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine body
was terrifyingly strong; he had long ago acquired the power of a True
God in close combat! For him to become a Daofather as well really was
nothing more than adding a bit of icing onto the cake; it wouldn’t
be of significant benefit to him in terms of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop a barren island
within the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
could sense a flood of Immortal energy coursing through him. Although
he was a second-tier Ancestral Immortal, thanks to the [One True
Body] and [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] techniques, his Immortal energy
was absolutely comparable to that of an Ancestral Immortal’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A first-tier
Ancestral Immortal…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power flowing
through me truly is incredibly thick and pure. It’s a pity that my
Primaltwin doesn’t have any good weapons.” The black-robed Ning
couldn’t help but frown. In the Three Realms, virtually all
overlord-class powers used Chaos treasures as their weapons! Daoist
Three Purities even had an entire set of Chaos treasures, as well as
the Immortal Slayiing Swords which he himself had devised!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body has
Violetjewel, but my Primaltwin has no suitable weapons. It seems I
need to pay the prisonworld another visit.” Ning came to this
conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A second figure
suddenly appeared next to Ning. It was Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Subhuti
had a smile on his face. “You’ve mastered a Heavenly Dao and
become a Daofather. Congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I was
able to make the breakthrough before the Endwar begins. Master, I
need to leave the Crescent world for a time,” Ning said. Although
he was at an extremely high level of power and was the undisputed
number one Sword Immortal of the Three Realms, he was still very weak
in terms of his mastery over spacetime. In this regard, he was far
from being a match for Daofather Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Subhuti
pointed towards the air next to Ning, causing a whirlpool to
immediately appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A second black-robed
Ning suddenly appeared next to the first one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although one Ning was
going to enter the spatial whirlpool, the other one was going to
remain on the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The icy star located
deep within the endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure appeared in
midair. Walking quickly, the figure soon reached a deep gorge, then
entered the prisonworld hidden deep inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
and the black-robed Ji Ning advanced through it,
shoulder-to-shoulder, emanating auras of tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The skinny,
emaciated, bone-chewing wild dog suddenly rose to his feet, staring
towards Ning’s direction. His dark yellow eyes stared fixedly at
Ning as he spoke out. “Not bad, kid. You actually upgraded your
Jindan from the third tier to the second tier…and you also learned
a powerful divine ability that allows you to have the power of a
first tier Jindan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Ji Nings
simultaneously glanced towards him and chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to thank you
for your advice all those years ago.” The white-robed Ning spoke
out, then the two quickly flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coward.” The wild
dog sneered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had first met
Ji Ning, he had discovered that Ji Ning had a third-tier Jindan. Now,
however, Ji Ning had the aura of a first-tier Ancestral Immortal…and
he certainly wasn’t a weak Chaos Immortal. The aura of pressure and
might which a Chaos Immortal had was completely different from that
of any Ancestral Immortal’s. Even someone with a third-tier Jindan
who broke through to become a Chaos Immortal would be an absolutely
terrifying figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This meant that Ji Ning
must have become an Ancestral Immortal. How, then, could an Ancestral
Immortal with a third-tier Jindan suddenly have the aura of a
first-tier Ancestral Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was only one
possibility!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, upgrade the
Jindan…but the Jindan could only be upgraded to the second tier at
most! The second step would be to rely on certain secret arts to
cause his power to vault all the way to that of a first-tier
Ancestral Immortal’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I’ll
definitely pay you a more in-depth visit.” Ning’s voice rang out
from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future?” A
bitter look instantly appeared on the wild dog’s face. “This
damnable Overseer…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
and the black-robed Ning continued to fly forward through the
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The prisonworld has
a total of sixteen Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals,” Ning
calculated silently to himself. “Anyone who not only has the
courage to offend a World God but also ends up being imprisoned here
instead of being slain or enslaved is definitely either extremely
powerful or has an important background.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I swept through
all of the True Gods and True Immortals, I learned quite a bit from
soulscouring them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These sixteen Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals…that wild dog is one of the three most
formidable ones,” Ning mused to himself. “Doesn’t matter. He’s
not one of my targets for this campaign.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild dog Elder God
was extremely famous in the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea as well. He was
born an Elder God, and over the course of countless years he had come
up with just a single divine ability…‘Eat’! The wild dog Elder
God loved to eat. He ate living creatures, delicacies, mountains,
rivers, the skies, the earth…he was an utter madman! He gave the
terrifying divine ability he had created an equally bizarre name:
‘Eat’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using just this single
divine ability, he had taken the lives of more than thirty Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals with his mouth! The King of Pangaea favored
him for his talent, and so even though he had disobeyed the King’s
will, the King had merely chosen to imprison him. The goal was to
tame his unruly temperament, then release him in the future and allow
him to once more fight on the kingdom’s behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild dog Elder God
could be described as amongst the most deadly of the sixteen
Ancestral Immortals and Elder Gods. Only two of the others could
match him for savagery and power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the wild dog
Elder God was free, he would pose a far greater danger than Godfiend
Witherspike,” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar is about
to erupt. I can’t let myself go too crazy with these Elder God and
Ancestral Immortal prisoners.” Still, Ning felt a certain itchiness
in his chest. He wanted to have a good fight with these Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals. After all, even if his true body was slain
in combat, he would be able to slowly rebuild it. That, however,
would most likely require more than ten thousand years. Ning didn’t
have the time to waste for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, my
target is Swordfather Triult,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfather Triult was
one of the sixteen imprisoned Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. He
was a Ki Refiner who possessed a set of three supreme Chaos swords,
and so he styled himself ‘Triult’. His attacks were extremely
powerful, but Ning was actually very confident in his ability to deal
with his type of powerful attacks. His protective divine ability was
a perfect counter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s only
knowledge of Swordfather Triult’s power came from those True Gods
and True Immortals. Thus, it was entirely possible that Swordfather
Triult had certain secret techniques that they didn’t know about.
Ning didn’t dare to be over-confident in fighting him…but for the
sake of acquiring that set of three Chaos swords, he still decided to
take the risk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
and the black-robed Ning quickly arrived at a place in the desolate
wilderness. A black-haired elder was seated in the lotus position
here, emanating an aura of boundless cold. The black-haired elder
opened his eyes, frowning as he looked at Ning. After becoming the
Overseer, Ning had never come here to bother Swordfather Triult.
Thus, the man didn’t recognize Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
black-haired elder frowned. “Judging from your aura, you should be
a first-tier Ancestral Immortal. The Overseer of a prisonworld
shouldn’t be someone as powerful as you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I do just so
happen to be the Overseer of this prisonworld.” The black-robed
Ning and the white-robed Ning landed at the same time, both radiating
auras of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
could sense the threat which Ning posed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the
Overseer?” The black-haired elder said in a low voice, “For the
prisonworld to fall into your hands…it must mean that Pangaea is
already destroyed. Speak. Why have you sought me out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over those
three ultimate swords of yours,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-haired elder’s eyes flashed with cold light. “Quite a few
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals have died to my swords.”
Although he had been imprisoned here, he was still able to unleash
his full power within an area of a thousand kilometers around him. He
naturally wouldn’t be willing to lower his head to other Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals unless he had to. He had risen to power
through blood and slaughter, and quite a few powerful figures had
died to his Triult swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems we have no
choice but to fight.” Ning was quite cautious as well. This was his
first time battling against an Ancestral Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Elder Gods were
only at that level of power because they were born with it. Ancestral
Immortals, however, had all definitely risen to their level of power
through cultivation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this was a
battle he had to win. He desperately needed a good Chaos sword for
the Endwar which was about to erupt.

Chapter 11 - Retainer
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
and the black-robed Ji Ning walked forward, shoulder-to-shoulder. The
two exchanged glances with the old man located in the center of the
distant wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waves of murderous
intent billowed from both sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since negotiations had
failed…it was time to fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth!” The
black-robed Ning let out a cold shout. The air around him instantly
became filled with a dense cluster of goldstar beads. The Goldstar
Beads of the Heavens quickly began to merge together, transforming
into the Thirty-Six Heavens. He filled them with his powerful
Ancestral Immortal energy, causing each of them to transform into a
beautiful frozen lotus. Each frozen lotus was like the core and
essence of an entire world, and when the thirty-six frozen lotuses
appeared, a stream of freezing energy filled the entire area around
them. The wilderness around them began to freeze and crack apart,
with space itself seeming to have been frozen solid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
black-robed Ning pointed in front of him, causing the thirty-six
frozen lotuses streaking forward through the skies and swiveling
around the black-haired elder like thirty-six streaks of frozen
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the past twenty
thousand years, Ning had improved dramatically both with the sword as
well as in the Dao! He would also spend quite a bit of time
meditating on the Nine Chaos Seals. Due to his tremendous level of
insight into the Dao, he had already mastered six of the chaos seals.
The sixth chaos seal allowed Ning to closely resonate with the
‘original essence of water’, something which was located
infinitely far away. As a result he was now able to manifest these
frozen lotuses, which could be used to emanate streams of
unfathomably cold energy to bind and trap foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After activating the
sixth chaos seal, Ning’s Thirty-Six Heavens were comparable to
ordinary Chaos treasures in power. Alas, in this form they could only
really be used to constrict and bind foes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to bind
me?” The black-haired elder let out a cold laugh. “I am an
Immortal cultivator, not a Fiendgod. I don’t even need to fight you
in close combat. What can this technique of yours possibly do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you won’t come
fight me in close combat, I’ll come fight you in close combat.”
The white-robed Ning’s body momentarily blurred as he manifested
the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique, holding five Darknorth swords
and Violetjewel in his six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
immediately surged forward like a streak of light, flying towards the
black-haired elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-haired elder’s face changed. Ki Refiners hated fighting in
close combat. He immediately let out a cold snort, causing two
streams of energy to emerge from his nostrils. These two streams of
energy crystallized like ice, forming a pair of divine swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just two of them?
Pull out all three of your swords,” Ning roared as he charged
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against you?” The
black-haired elder sneered coldly, “Two swords is enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two crystalline
swords sliced out in two streaks of light, causing the air itself to
glimmer with frozen energy as they struck straight towards the
white-robed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two attacks
collided against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
was knocked backwards, his face changing slightly. “Damn.” As
soon as they exchanged blows, he realized that this Ancestral
Immortal definitely had the power of an elite Elder God! He was even
more difficult to deal with than Godfiend Witherspike had been.
Fortunately, Ning had mastered the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand]; otherwise, Ning wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little bit of
power you possess won’t be enough to allow you to even get near
me,” the black-haired man sneered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?” The
white-robed Ning charged forward once again, striking out with all
six swords. This time, he applied the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand] to each hand! His mighty divine power instantly burst forth,
causing six streaks of sword-light to tear through the skies,
carrying an aura of inexorable might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flashing
crystalline swords that were striking out towards Ning were instantly
struck by thise blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two crystalline
swords were actually smashed flying backwards. On Ning’s side, the
flashing strike from the blood-colored Violetjewel continued to
streak forwards, striking out more than a thousand kilometers as it
hacked towards the distant black-haired elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His divine ability
is pretty powerful.” The black-haired elder frowned slightly. A
third sword that was golden in color flew straight out from his
forehead, quickly expanding in size to become more than three hundred
meters long. It swept forward in a straight line, carrying an aura of
utmost forceful Yang energy as it struck against Ning’s
Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his hand go
numb as Violetjewel was knocked backwards, but the golden sword was
also knocked backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” Ning once
more charged forward, six swords in six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
black-haired elder frowned as he glanced at the icy lotuses
surrounding him. The icy lotuses were emanating streams of energy
that furiously coiled around him, constricting his movements.
Although he wasn’t fighting in close combat, his three swords were
still somewhat impacted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Triult Sword, First
Stance!” The black-haired elder’s eyes flashed with cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two crystal swords
and the golden sword came together in midair to form a triangle, with
the surface of the triangle flowing with runic light. Soon, the light
solidified to form an shockingly sharp sword that was golden-white in
color. When the sword appeared, an aura of infinite sharpness
instantly appeared, slicing apart the energy streams surrounding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed
dramatically as he saw this. “Such power. They really do form a
perfect set of Chaos swords. These three Chaos swords are at least
high-grade Chaos treasures; in fact, they could well be top-grade
Chaos treasures. When the seals inside of them combine together to
unleash their full power, they are almost as powerful as my own
Violetjewel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
of the Three Realms had something similar. He had those four Chaos
swords, which he was able to link together with the Immortal Slaying
Sword-Diagram. By Ning’s estimation, that set was also close to
Violetjewel in power. This was how powerful a complete set of Chaos
treasures could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Smash!” The
distant black-robed figure let out an angry roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six frozen
lotuses that had merely been hanging in the air around him all
suddenly rushed towards him like meteors, smashing against the
white-gold sword. Every single Frozen Lotus of the Heavens moved with
incredible speed, far beyond the limits of the Heavenly Daos.
Although this was just a simple smashing movement, it was based off
of the ‘Shadowless’ stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
The Frozen Lotuses of the Heavens smashed down one after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The
three-headed, six-armed, white-robed Ning once more charged forward
with his six swords at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-white sword
blasted away all the attacks; the Frozen Lotuses of the Heavens were
primarily meant to be used to constrict the foe through the release
of freezing energy, after all. They were rather similar to the
Waterflame Apocalypse Formation in that regard. If they were used to
smash…they would at most be comparable to top-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures. They were simply too weak in this regard, whereas
the gold-white sword was almost as powerful as Violetjewel itself.
When they were joined together, they had very nearly surpassed the
limits of power possible for Chaos treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel transformed
into a black hole, moving to defend against the gold-white sword as
the other five swords struck out. The black hole of sword-light was
actually able to completely defend against the gold-white sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
black-haired elder’s face completely changed. “This sword-art…”
He himself was a sword-wielder; he could immediately sense how
terrifying that sword-light was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black hole of
sword-light seemed eternal and inexhaustible, with no end and no
beginning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just smiled
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art, ‘Heartsword’ stance, was simply far too
profound. Ning simply wasn’t able to master it. However, the main
purpose of the ninety-eight stone steles which World God Northrest
had left behind was to teach the principle of the ‘hidden blade’.
The ‘Heartsword’ stance actually also represented a profound
offensive and defensive technique. After analyzing the ‘Heartsword’
stance, then focusing on the principles of the ‘hidden blade’,
Ning felt that there were many similarities with his own ‘Soleheart’
stance. Thus, he fused all of his insights into his ‘Soleheart’
stance, causing it to now be the most profound of the five stances he
had developed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While blocking with one
sword, Ning continued to charge forward and attack with the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Triult Sword, Second
Stance!” The black-haired elder had an ugly look on his face. He
had only come up with two stances thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gold-white sword
suddenly began to spin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s black hole of
sword-light instantly began to tremble. It was only able to resist
for a brief period of time before breaking apart, and the white-gold
sword immediately stabbed Ning on the chest, knocking him one step
backwards. However, it was only able to leave behind a white spot on
his skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A protective divine
ability?” The black-haired elder was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgods were skilled
in close combat, causing Ki Refiners endless headaches. Fiendgods who
had exceptionally powerful protective divine abilities caused even
more headaches!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The frozen
lotuses in the air suddenly began to smash towards the black-haired
elder once more. A black chain instantly flew out from the
black-haired elder’s body, coiling around him and blocking all the
strikes from the frozen lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The
white-robed Ning once more charged forward, and the black-haired
elder’s face instantly turned extremely grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.” The
black-haired elder gave up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning’s
clothes were riddled with holes, but those holes were soon repaired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wasn’t
trapped here and forced to endure your assaults without being able to
flee, you wouldn’t be able to do anything to me.” The
black-haired elder stared coldly at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to admit that
this was true. His protective divine ability, combined with his
superlative sword-arts, made it so that although the black-haired man
worked hard to keep his distance from Ning, in the end he was still
caught. The moment that Ning caught up to him was the moment that he
lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can give you the
Triult Swords.” The black-haired elder looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood in front of
the black-haired elder, his murderous intent billowing forwards.
“Previously, I merely wanted the Triult Swords. Now, your life
itself is in my hands. You had best be obedient and submit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Submit?” The
black-haired elder’s face changed, but then he let out a snicker.
“Even if I was willing to submit and be your retainer, there’s no
way for me to leave this place and battle by your side, unless you
are capable of releasing me from the prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no way of
releasing you. Not now, at least,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why even speak
of ‘submission’?” The black-haired elder shook his head
disdainfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to search
your memories,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Ancestral Immortal
would definitely know many things. He might learn something of use to
him for the war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!” The
black-haired elder’s face changed, and he roared angrily, “I’m
willing to submit to you, to be your retainer and to fight to the
death in your service! However, don’t even think about shaming me
in such a way. I would rather die than let you search my memories!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really was going to
be quite difficult, as expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After gaining the
teachings of World God Northrest, Ning understood that when voyaging
through the endless primordial chaos, there was a certain custom
known as ‘taking on retainers’. Certain extremely powerful
cultivators would often have retainers who served them and followed
them. True Gods and True Immortals were considered weaklings without
power, and so they were often simply captured and enslaved. Of the
six servants of Godfiend Witherspike, five had been enslaved in such
a manner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
also retainers such as ‘Saber’ who chose to follow someone in
order to repay a debt! They could be described as servants, but they
were no slaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
was willing to be Ning’s retainer, but he absolutely was not
willing to allow Ning to search his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos, Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals generally were
figures who were respected and honored.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I have no
choice but to do this.” Ning stared at the black-haired elder, his
eyes brimming with killing intent. However, he didn’t take action
right away, wanting to instead try and pressure the old man one last
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can make one final
concession.” The black-haired elder gritted his teeth. “I can
swear a lifeblood oath that I will never lie to you. You can ask me
any question you desire. So long as your questions do not impinge on
certain personal matters that I cannot discuss with outsiders, I will
answer them to the best of my ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lifeblood oath?”
Ning’s eyes lit up. “You have an oathstone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only World Gods and Chaos Immortals could swear lifeblood oaths.
Elder Gods, Ancestral Immortals, and weaker cultivators would
generally only be able to swear lifeblood oaths if they made use of
an oathstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was preparing to
set up my own school. Of course I prepared an oathstone long in
advance!” The black-haired elder waved his hand, causing a jade
globe to appear within it. Runes swirled over the surface of the jade
globe. “This is an oathstone which was personally forged by a Chaos
Immortal. It cost me ninety-nine drops of chaos nectar to purchase
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the words
‘chaos nectar’, Ning felt delighted. Ancestral Immortals really
were different from lower-ranking cultivators. They had far higher
statuses, and they had far better treasures! The only reason why he
was able to force this person to bow his head was because he was
trapped here, unable to move more than a thousand kilometers away! In
the outside world, this Ancestral Immortal would’ve fled long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is now an
ownerless item. You can bind it.” The black-haired elder offered
the jade globe to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An oathstone.”
Ning waved his hand, causing it to fly over to him. He immediately
began to bind it, then activated the lifeblood oath ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swear your lifeblood
oath.” Ning looked at the black-haired elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
let out a soft sigh. Retainer? This Overseer was, at best, on par
with him in power. If they were in the outside world, he absolutely
wouldn’t be willing to be this man’s retainer at all! Still…in
the face of death, he chose to bow his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
stretched out with his hand, placing it against the oathstone. He
could sense the lifeblood oath that had been activated. He didn’t
try to fight it; instead, he borrowed from its power, causing his
soul to begin swearing an oath. “I swear on my very life itself
that I shall forever follow…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the master of the
oathstone, Ning was able to sense the man’s soul making this
lifeblood oath.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the
black-haired elder said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning sighed silently
to himself. Ning knew himself to merely be a newly ascended Ancestral
Immortal; it wasn’t very likely that he would be able to force
other Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals to become his retainers, but
he had succeeded in doing so. If he was in the primordial chaos, even
if had managed to take on a retainer, it would have been his
responsibility to provide his retainers with treasures and weapons.
This was an extremely fair relationship; if the retainer was to risk
his life for the master, then the master had to provide the retainer
with cultivation techniques and treasures. This was the reason why
powerful cultivators generally found it fairly easy to acquire
retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, on the other
hand, ended up extorting his retainers for THEIR treasures…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the black-haired
elder was going to remain locked up in here. Only a World God or
Chaos Immortal would be strong enough to break his chains! Thus, even
though he had pledged his allegiance, there was no way he could
really serve on Ning’s behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me ask you a
question.” Ning looked at the black-haired elder. “Do you have an
‘Elder God Formation’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God
Formation?” The black-haired elder was flabbergasted. “Master,
are you perhaps thinking a bit too highly of me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even a small one
would do,” Ning said hurriedly. “Or perhaps the other fifteen
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals imprisoned here…would any of
them have an ‘Elder God Formation’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifteen?” The
black-haired elder was surprised. “Which fifteen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was kept separate
from the others. The only Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals he knew
of were the ones who had been imprisoned here before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They include
Ancestral Immortal Jadetide…” Ning listed all fifteen of the
other names.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that madman was
imprisoned here as well? Good, good, good!” The black-haired elder
was in quite a good mood upon hearing these names…but he then
looked at Ning and shook his head. “Master, forget about acquiring
an Elder God Formation. Although all the Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals who have been imprisoned here are extraordinary, formations
like that aren’t for meant the likes of us. None of the Elder Gods
or Ancestral Immortals of Pangaea would be able to acquire any Elder
God Formation, even one that is only meant for four or five Elder
Gods. Generally speaking, only World Gods and Chaos Immortals will be
able to acquire them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Formations
could be meant for many experts or just a few.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some, for example,
could be used by as few as six Elder Gods! The six Elder Gods would
take bind different parts of the formation stone, allowing them to
naturally join together in a large formation. They would be able to
seamlessly share their divine power together, with their attacks
dramatically increasing in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Elder God Formation
that could use up to a hundred Elder Gods would be able to give even
a World God a good fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even small-scale Elder
God Formations could be used to dominate other Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was something
which Ning badly wanted to acquire. Ever since he had heard of them
from World God Northrest’s legacy, he had wanted to acquire one! If
the Elder Gods of the Nuwa Alliance could join together in an Elder
God Formation, they would definitely be able to effortlessly dominate
the Seamless Gate with ease. Even if they didn’t have enough Elder
Gods, they would be able to use certain True Gods to temporarily fill
in positions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even small-scale
Elder God Formations would require five hundred bottles of chaos
nectar in trade.” The black-haired elder shook his head. “Five
hundred bottles! The King of Pangaea spent unbelievable amounts of
resources and hard work in order to construct those thirty-six chaos
nectar refinery formations. Although those thirty-six formations are
known as ‘prisons’, in the eyes of the King of Pangaea their true
value lies in their ability to distill chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The prisonworlds can
be said to be the most important treasures of Pangaea. For even a
prisonworld to fall into your hands…it means that the chaos-kingdom
of Pangaea might have truly been annihilated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty-six
prisonworlds…each chaos cycle, they can only produce roughly two
hundred bottles of chaos nectar.” The black-haired elder looked at
Ning. “An entire chaos cycle! But small-scale Elder God Formations
will require at least five hundred bottles of chaos nectar. World
Gods and Chaos Immortals might be able to afford such a price, but
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals generally would not, unless they
are ridiculously powerful or had absolutely incredible luck. Those of
us who lived in Pangaea would rarely go out to adventure and risk our
lives. Of course we wouldn’t have enough treasures!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods could
generally be divided into two different types. The first type
consisted of Elder Gods like Gonggong, Suiren, or Swordfather Triult;
they spent their entire life in just a single chaosworld, rarely
going out to adventure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second type
consisted of the likes of the Lord of All Things or Godfiend
Witherspike. They often went out adventuring. They acted carefully
for fear of losing their lives, but if they were successful they
could reap fantastic rewards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much chaos
nectar or chaos jewels do you have?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have two bottles
of chaos nectar and just a hundred or so chaos jewels,” the
black-haired elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
How disappointing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, this was the
average networth for an ordinary Ancestral Immortal. Most of his
resources would have been spent in acquiring those valuable Chaos
treasures, after all! That black chain, for example; it would be
worth quite a few bottles of chaos nectar. As for the Triult Swords?
They were worth dozens of bottles of chaos nectar, and Swordfather
Triult had only acquired them after spending countless years building
up his resources.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos nectar was
something of a common currency in the endless primordial chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the extracted
essence of chaos energy and could be used to replenish the soul,
divine power, Immortal energy, heartforce, all physical wounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After asking the
black-haired elder a few more questions, Ning finally gave up on
acquiring an Elder God Formation, a World Castle, or any other
incredibly powerful treasures. It really just wasn’t realistic.
Only the most monstrously powerful Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals
had access to such treasures, such as the ones who were able to
battle against even World Gods and Chaos Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and give me
your Chaos treasures,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” The
black-haired elder revealed a hint of pain in his eyes, but he still
waved his hand, causing the two crystalline swords and the golden
sword to join together and fly over towards Ning. The black chains
appeared as well, spinning around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only have two?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much more do you
want?” The black-haired elder said angrily, “I nearly lost my
life in acquiring the Triult Swords. Go ahead and see how many of the
other fifteen Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals here have treasures
superior to the Triult Swords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
waved his hand and accepted the two treasures, sending out his
Immortal energy to quickly bind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” A look
flashed past Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many levels of
the Triult Swords and the Darkcloud Chains have you mastered?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve mastered the
third level of the Triult Swords and the second level of the
Chaincloud Chains,” the black-haired elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Take out
all your other treasures and let me choose from them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” The
black-haired elder was instantly rendered speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was worse than a
robbery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What sort of a person
extorted his own retainers like this?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t pay any
attention to the man as he picked through the treasures. These
treasures weren’t very useful to him, and the two bottles of chaos
nectar wouldn’t make much of a difference, but…when he left the
Three Realms in the future, he would have to make sure that he had
enough good things to leave behind for his daughter Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After cleaning out the
black-haired elder, Ning immediately left. He wasn’t willing to
face the old man’s glowering, resentful glare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He located a nearby
mountain, then landed atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the three Chaos swords to appear in the air before him as
well as the large, serpent-like black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackcloud Chains.
It has three levels of power, and can just barely be considered a
high-grade Chaos treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Triult
Swords…ehehe. They actually have six levels of power, and all three
are top-grade Chaos treasures. Upon being joined together, they
actually exceed the entire Chaos-level of power.” Ning nodded
silently to himself, then began to test out binding the treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, he bound the
Blackcloud Chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blackcloud Chains
could be used to bind and trap enemies, or it could be used to circle
around the user and deflect enemy attacks! Ning’s true body didn’t
need this sort of protective treasure, as he had an extremely strong
protective divine ability, but his Primaltwin was only an Ancestral
Immortal. His Primaltwin’s body wouldn’t be able to resist enemy
attacks in the same way, making the Blackcloud Chains quite a useful
item for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first level is
fairly simple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second
level…done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending a bit
more than two hours, Ning finished mastering the first two levels of
the Blackcloud Chains. The aura of the Blackcloud Chains increased
dramatically in strength, and the chains themselves seemed to move
more agilely as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
truly were at an incredibly profound level. As a result, he had now
mastered six of the Nine Chaos Seals, even though he only spent part
of his time analyzing them. Even Daoist Three Purities had only
mastered seven of the chaos seals back during the Primordial Era.
Thus, he was able to easily master the first two levels of the
Blackcloud Chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level is
too difficult…I won’t be able to unlock it in a short period of
time.” Ning spent six more hours working on the chains before
giving up. “I’ll focus on the Triult Swords first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel’s
still the best. There are no restrictions or levels that I need to
bind and unlock,” Ning said with a sigh. “It’s a divine sword
that has a core quintessence within it, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos weapons were
considered fairly high-level weapons. Above Chaos weapons were Dao
weapons. World Gods and Chaos Immortals generally would use Dao
weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel, however,
was something that surpassed even Dao weapons! It even had a core
quintessence within it. Ning had merely repaired the surface layer of
the sword, but that was still enough to allow it to have more power
than any Chaos weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course,
Violetjewel was a weapon which even World Gods and Chaos Immortals
would go berserk for. When World God Northrest had fled all those
years ago, he had sent his truesoul riding on the sword. All his
other treasures had been lost, and even his very body itself had been
lost. The only things left to him were his truesoul and his precious
sword.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 13 - The Battle Begins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wonder what
sort of damnable places World God Northrest entered when he fled.
Even something as tough and precious as Violetjewel was damaged to
such a degree!” Ji Ning couldn’t help but sigh. Those three
Wujiao Godbeasts who had chased after World God Northrest were very
famous amongst World Gods as well. When they attacked him, they did
so with the goal of annihilating his truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If World God Northrest
managed to send a message back to Vastheaven Palace, the three of
them would be doomed! Thus, when World God Northrest had frantically
fled, the three of them had chased just as frantically! All World God
Northrest had left had been the remnants of his soul and his sword.
For the sake of fleeing, he had fled into every dangerous area he
encountered, including areas that were known to be utterly deadly
even for World Gods! As for the three Wujiao Godbeasts, they had
entered those places as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators, by their
very nature, would often enter dangerous regions. The only places
which the three Wujiao Godbeasts would not dare to enter were those
places where death was absolutely guaranteed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Teleporting through
space, blinking through time, diving into danger zones…in the end,
even Violetjewel had been badly damaged. Finally, he had managed to
escape into the Three Realms, but he was no longer able to flee any
further. As for Violetjewel, the only part of it that remained intact
and undamaged was its core quintessence, which remained very stable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there quietly,
meditating as he bound the swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seals within the
Triult Swords were clearly much more complicated. He was only able to
bind and unlock both the first and the second levels of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning
was secretly delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After unlocking the
first level, he found that each sword could be used as he pleased.
After unlocking the second level, he found that the three swords
could be combined into one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another two days,
he finally managed to bind and unlock the third level as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m at the same
level which Swordfather Triult was at.” Ning continued to proceed
to the fourth level. The more levels he could unlock, the more
powerful the swords would become! Swordfather Triult was a fairly
powerful Ancestral Immortal of Pangaea, but when viewed in the
context of the vast primordial chaos, he was nothing more than an
average figure. Even the likes of the Lord of All Things was nothing
more than a minor figure amongst the Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals of the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth level is
quite difficult. Still, I should be able to master it, given time.”
After working on it for half a day, Ning began to frown. He expected
that it would take several years for him to master it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Best to finish the
process in the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was fishing alongside his daughter Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His main true body and
his main Primaltwin were both located in the prisonworld. Only his
backup Primaltwin remained here in the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master has
already caught twelve. Brightmoon, you haven’t even caught a single
one.” Autumn Leaf looked into the fish buckets, then smiled as she
teased Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know
what’s going on?” Brightmoon glared at her nearby father.
“Father, are you cheating?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon looked quite
similar to Yu Wei, and she also liked to dress in black, just like
her mother. Each time he saw his daughter, he couldn’t help but
think of his senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…” Ning murmured to himself, “After the war,
I’ll leave the Three Realms. The Three Realms is a small place,
after all. There are no techniques here I can use to save you…but
perhaps in the outside world there is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One reason he was going
to leave the Three Realms was in order to find Vastheaven Palace. The
other reason was because Ning still clung onto a thin strand of hope
that he might one day find a way to rescue his wife. Saving his
parents would be much easier, comparatively speaking; all he had to
do was become a World God or Chaos Immortal. Rescuing his wife,
however, would be incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon, you’ve
been watching me like a hawk. If I cheated, you would know, right?”
Ning laughed as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve mastered
the Heavenly Dao of Water, Father. If you were cheating, how would a
little girl like me be able to find out?” Brightmoon muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” Ning
laughed. Whenever he was with his daughter, he couldn’t help but
smile and laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the final
battle for karmic luck is about to again. Come to the Allclans Palace
right away.” Subhuti’s voice suddenly rang out by Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to Brightmoon,
Ning suddenly froze mid-laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So…it has finally
begun.” Ning’s breathing turned a bit ragged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father?”
Brightmoon looked towards Ning. “What happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. Let’s
keep fishing,” Ning said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The icy star located
deep in the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A white-robed
Ning suddenly appeared in the skies above the icy star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has finally
begun.” Ning quickly flew teleported through the void and
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Allclans Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Ji Ning
suddenly appeared at the gates of the Allclans Palace. As he
appeared, all the major powers inside the palace turned to look at
him. Because both his true body and his Primaltwin had entered the
prisonworld and were completely separated from the outside world,
there was no way for Ning to keep an incarnation present in the
Allclans Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has
arrived.” Daoist Three Purities rose to his feet. “Let us go. The
Seamless Gate has already mobilized their army; let us mobilize
ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major powers
had sent their true bodies, because they all knew that once the final
battle for karmic luck began, the Endwar would definitely be nigh.
Thus everyone, Fuxi and Shennong included, had all hastened back from
the primordial chaos. In fact, even that stooped, masked figure
dressed in gray robes had made his appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
masked, gray-robed figure. He mused to himself, “He should be
Gonggong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Suiren, Fuxi, Shennong, Houyi, Ji Ning,
and the gray-robed figure walked at the head of the pack. Behind them
walked Subhuti and the rest of the major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiring group
of major powers flew out of the Allclans Palace and into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared downwards.
He immediately saw that the Humanworld of Yu the Great was filled
with teeming masses of Immortal armies. The armies stretched off into
the horizon, like so many countless dragons that lay coiled
throughout the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the Immortal
armies and Fiendgod armies of the Nuwa Alliance in the Three Realms
have been summoned.” Daoist Three Purities let out a soft sigh.
“Xuan Yuan, give the order.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan had been standing behind him. He immediately sent the mental
order. “Mobilize.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utterly titanic tears
in the sky began to appear in front of them. One Immortal army after
another began to flood forward and soar towards the tears in the sky.
The battlefield for this final battle for karmic luck would be the
vast Void itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the previous
Realmwars, the various major powers had acted to keep the major
worlds stable, making it possible for them to endure the
earth-shaking devastation wrought by each side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This final battle for
karmic luck, however, involved simply far too many Immortals and
Fiendgods. This represented nearly all of the Immortals and Fiendgods
that existed in the entire Three Realms. If they were to battle on a
single major world, that major world would most likely be instantly
annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Solar Star
could be seen glowing with light, illuminating the darkness of the
Void. However, the Void still remained a dark, gray place. It was
simply too far from the Solar Star, making it seem rather dim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armies of the
Seamless Gate were beginning to appear in the distant parts of the
Void, joining together into multiple giant formations that were
spread out throughout the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal armies of
the Nuwa Alliance continued to flood out through their spatial rifts,
moving into formation as had been previous ordained. Both sides
stared at their enemies, separated from them by tens of millions of
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind each side’s
armies were their major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
Lord Tathagata, Suiren, Shennong, Fuxi, Houyi, the masked figure, and
the rest of the major powers were all standing behind their armies,
staring at the enemy forces ahead of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve flourished
for countless years.” Fuxi murmured softly, “In terms of major
powers, Empyrean Gods, True Immortals, and even Celestial
Immortals…far more exist in this era of the Three Realms than
existed during the Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This war is also far
larger in scale than the war which ended the Primordial Era.”
Daoist Three Purities nodded slowly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xuan Yuan. It is now
up to you.” Lord Buddha looked towards the nearby Yellow Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the Yellow
Emperor’s responsibility for directing their armies in this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he stared
at their vast allied armies. As he scanned through their ranks, he
saw so many faces he recognized. They included his fellow
apprentices, such as senior apprentice-sister Empyrean Phoenix,
Junwu, and Goldcrow. They also included Ning’s own subordinates,
such as Ninefangs, Primelight, and Sunblaze. He also saw the Xia
Emperor as well as the Empyrean Gods he had rescued from Undermoon
Lake, such as the Seven Dragon Gods, Oddwitch, Eastvoid, Buyou, and
Sin…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes blazed
with torch-light as he turned to stare at the vast army of the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately saw
Sword Immortal Evergreen…the three Diremonster Gods of Mount
Dragoneater…Fairy Deadgrass…True Immortal Gaudy…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, do you
still remember him?” Lord Tathagata suddenly spoke out to Ning
while pointing towards a distant figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed
Tathagata’s finger and saw one of their formation commanders. This
was a barefoot Bodhisattva who was dressed in yellow robes and whose
face was pale and handsome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is…?” Ning
immediately felt that this person looked quite familiar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bodhisattva
Eastluck,” Lord Buddha said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastluck?” Ning
immediately remembered the man. No wonder he had looked familiar!
When Ning had first gone to learn the [Five Treasures] sword-art
which Daofather Fuju had left behind, he had encountered this spoiled
prince, Eastluck. Ning had ordered Prince Eastluck to become a
servant at an innhouse for three hundred years, and had commanded
that he allow others to hit him and berate him without fighting back
or talking back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You sent him
to work as a servant in the mortal world for three hundred years with
the goal of tempering his arrogance. Instead, he came to truly
understand his own heart! He ended up understanding the Dao and
becoming a Celestial Immortal, then joined my Buddhist Sangha. His
rate of advancement was simply astonishing…” Lord Buddha sighed
with praise. “He truly has the heart of a Buddha, and my Buddhist
techniques were perfect for him. If he was given enough time, he
would stand a very good chance of becoming a major power as well.
Alas, the war has already arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning felt
quite pleased as well. He had never imagined that the spoiled Prince
Eastluck who had provoked him would become Bodhisattva Eastluck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to stare
at their forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
people who he had ties to. There were also quite a few who had
grudges against him. They were all scattered throughout the various
Immortal and Fiendgod armies. At this point in time, they were
nothing more than minor chess pieces in the Endwar. Ning, however,
had carved out a path for himself via his cultivation. He had also
been blessed by luck and opportunity, and as a result he now stood at
the very peak of power. He was capable of truly influencing the
entire course of the war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many of
them will be alive after the war.” Ning continued to quietly look
at them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan’s voice echoed through the endless Void, reverberating by the
ears of every single Immortal and Fiendgod. “We once permitted you
to enter our Three Realms and live amongst us. It’s one thing for
you to be ungrateful, but how dare you once more stir up trouble and
cause such a great war? You were even so despicable and shameless as
to assassinate the family and friends of our major powers, Empyrean
Gods, and True Immortals. Now…you wish to fight? Do you think our
side is afraid of you? Hah! You lost the war all those years ago, and
you’ll lose the war this time as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap.” A
cold laugh rang out from amongst the major powers of the distant
Seamless Gate. “The victors pronounce themselves kings while the
losers are derided as bandits. If we win, we’ll become the masters
of the Three Realms. Only one of us will be able to survive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then all of you can
die.” Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s cold voice echoed through the
Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” “Kill!”
“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Void seemed
to be filled with these cries. The hundreds of millions of Immortals
and Fiendgods in the many armies all roared furiously, causing the
entire Three Realms to tremble.

Chapter 14 - The Battle for Karmic Luck (1)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two titanic armies
of Immortals and Fiendgods began to charge towards each other,
smashing upon each other like a pair of massive anvils! Of course,
the ones who charged forward were the ones skilled in close combat.
There were quite a few ancient, massive formations that were located
in the rear, throwing large-scale spells and attacks against the
battlefield. The attacks blotted out the sun, causing even the Void
to splinter and shatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yellow Emperor Xuan
Yuan solemnly and carefully deployed his troops.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha, Daoist Three Purities, Suiren, Shennong, Fuxi, Ji NIng,
Houyi, and the masked man all stood at the back lines, watching the
battle and keeping an eye on the actions of the major powers of the
Seamless Gate. They were determined to prevent the Seamless Gate’s
major powers from launching any sneak attacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the final
battle for karmic luck had begun, it was possible that the Seamless
Gate’s major powers would suddenly launch the Endwar if they
thought they were losing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The advantage lies
with us right now,” Daoist Three Purities said in a cold voice. “We
won’t be in a rush to launch the Endwar. The Seamless Gate,
however, is different. They have a slightly weaker hand to play; once
they completely despair of victory, they will launch the Endwar.
Suiren, Ji Ning, the two of you are the quickest; when the time
comes, it will be up to the two of you to stop the Seamless Gate’s
sneak attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Suiren
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them had
both mastered the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique; if the
Seamless Gate was to launch a sneak attack, they would be able to
intercept it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our side is
beginning to sustain casualties already,” Tathagata said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Casualties are
impossible to completely avoid.” Suiren’s eyes glowed with divine
power, a desire to do battle radiating from his entire body. He said
in a low voice, “Sometimes, victory can only be won when you pay a
price in blood.” It had been Suiren who had led the human race from
obscurity to power. He knew very well that an enormous price had been
paid in blood and bones for the human race to rise to its current
illustrious state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched it all
unfold silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Sloppy…” Ning suddenly saw an unremarkable
figure located in a distant ‘Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation’. It
was his eldest disciple-brother of the Black-White College. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
for him to become a Pure Yang True Immortal as well.” Ning sighed
to himself. “If he hadn’t broken through, he might’ve been able
to avoid this battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weaker disciples
and family members of the various major powers, such as those who had
merely become Celestial Immortals, were generally permitted not to
take part in this battle. Ning’s own daughter Brightmoon was one
example, and Daofather Crimsonbright’s disciple Adept Woodpass was
another. Both were Celestial Immortals, and there was no real point
to them taking part in this battle. No matter what, the Nuwa Alliance
still had to preserve its next generation, and so its lower-level
geniuses were not required to take part in the battle. As for the
likes of Autumn Leaf or Bluecliff Xiaoyu, who weren’t even
Celestial Immortals, there was of course no point whatsoever for them
to get involved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for anyone who
became an Empyrean God or True Immortal, things were different. The
Sloppy Daoist and Bodhisattva Eastluck were all geniuses as well, but
they were required to take part in this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There would only be an
exception if an extremely important member of the Nuwa Alliance
absolutely insisted on protecting them. Someone like Daoist Three
Purities, Tathagata, Suiren, or Ji Ning could insist on protecting a
particular Empyrean God or True Immortal. For example, if Ning’s
daughter had theoretically become a True Immortal and Ning was
unwilling for her to suffer any danger, the Nuwa Alliance would be
willing to satisfy this personal request of Ji Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, even major
powers would only rarely make a request like this. Even if they did,
they would at most request for one or two of their most dearly
beloved family members to be protected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Subhuti, for
example, did not ask for a single one of his disciples to be
protected! All of them had gone off to war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those dazzling
geniuses of yore have become nothing more than minor chess pieces on
this battlefield.” Faced with such a deluge of Immortals and
Fiendgods, Ning could keenly sense how irrelevant a single person’s
power and ability was. Even most True Gods and Daofathers would feel
powerless in the face of a war like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were using
enormous formations, and the attacks from these formations surpassed
the power of an ordinary True God or Daofather; the attacks were very
close to the power of elite Daofathers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first time the two
massive armies clashed, they battled for roughly an hour before both
sides withdrew. This sort of battle caused both sides to use up
Immortal energy and divine power at an absolutely staggering rate.
Virtually every single Immortal and Fiendgod in the Three Realms was
taking part in this battle, and so neither the Nuwa Alliance nor the
Seamless Gate could possibly provide enough Immortal pills for them
to replenish their energy. Thus, their only choice was to battle over
and over again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides proceeded
very carefully with each clash, doing their best to locate the
enemy’s weak spots and tear them apart as much as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the very first day
of battle, the Nuwa Alliance lost a total of 612 Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, more than 3.2 million Celestial Immortals, and
countless lower-level cultivators. As for the Seamless Gate, they
lost 122 Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, more than 1.89 million
Celestial Immortals, and countless lower-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the sixth day of
battle, the Nuwa Alliance had lost a total of 925 Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals, more than 5.62 million Celestial Immortals, and
countless lower-level cultivators. The Seamless Gate had lost a total
of 531 Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, more than 1 million
Celestial Immortals, and countless lower-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the nineteenth day
of battle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the twenty-sixth day
of battle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides continued to
do their best to seek out the enemy’s weak points, and they proceed
tentatively with each clash. Casualties were still fairly light,
given that almost all of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three
Realms were taking part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixty-ninth day of
battle. The battle this day was noticeably more vicious than on
previous days. More Empyrean Gods and True Immortals died on this day
than during all previous days combined. This was because on this day,
both the Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance had almost
simultaneously revealed their bugbeast armies. The appearance of the
dominating bugbeasts armies immediately destabilized the battlefield,
resulting in large-scale massacres.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.” Yellow
Emperor Xuan Yuan gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Nuwa Alliance
and the Seamless Gate began to withdraw their troops. The mood on the
battlefield was noticeably much grimmer than before, with countless
Immortals and Fiendgods having frenzied looks in their eyes. All of
the cultivators knew that there was nowhere to run; their only choice
was to stake their own lives in an attempt to take the lives of their
opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually have
slightly more bugbeasts than we do.” Fuxi frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They gained the
legacies of the Lord of All Things. It’s not that strange that they
also gained his bugbeast techniques.” Daoist Three Purities said
coldly, “Although they have slightly more bugbeasts than we do,
things are still manageable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Evergreen…” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had always been
wanting to find an opportunity to kill this traitor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, no one
would’ve imagined what had happened. Due to both sides suddenly
adding bugbeasts into their armies, the balance between the two sides
had been completely disrupted. Faced with critical danger, Sword
Immortal Evergreen had actually made a sudden breakthrough! He had
mastered one of the Heavenly Daos, causing a resonance that everyone
was able to feel. Sword Immortal Evergreen had immediately swallowed
Great Firmament Immortal pills to breakthrough to become a Golden
Immortal of the Great Firmament (Daofather). After he made a
breakthrough, he immediately suffered frenzied, concentrated attacks
attacks from the Nuwa Alliance. He became a focal point…resulting
in him being slain almost instantly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few seconds
after becoming a Daofather, Sword Immortal Evergreen had been
assaulted by more than ten mighty formations. He had died on the
spot!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this sort of massive
battle, anyone who seemed particularly impressive or eye-catching
would immediately draw enormous amounts of concentrated firepower on
his or her head. Only someone close to the overlord level of power
would be able to survive; anyone else would almost certainly perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too many died in
this battle.” Shennong sighed softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are no other
choices.” Suiren suppressed the pain he felt in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt miserable as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This latest battle was
the most vicious battle to date in the final war for karmic luck. As
a result of this battle, the total number of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals the Nuwa Alliance had lost had reached more than 8600! As
for Celestial Immortals? Celestial Immortal casualties had surpassed
a hundred million! Loose Immortals and Fiendgods? Forget about even
trying to tell them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things weren’t much
better for the Seamless Gate either. Although they were supported by
many powerful golems, they were still the weaker side in this
conflict. They had lost more than 6900 Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals and more than 92 million Celestial Immortals. Their Loose
Immortal casualties were also horrendous beyond count.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These simple, plain
numbers represented a hideous loss of life amongst Immortals and
Fiendgods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far, far too many had
died in this battle…including many of Ning’s good friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old brother Buyou.
Roughpeak…” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself. More than
ten of the Empyrean Gods he had rescued from Undermoon Lake had died
just now, including Empyrean Gods Buyou and Roughpeak. He had been
particularly close to those two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And Eastluck…”
Ning sighed again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That stubborn wastrel
of a prince…after his temper had been tamed, he had revealed his
tremendous talent and brilliance. He had skyrocketed in power after
entering the Buddhist Sangha, causing even Lord Buddha to take notice
of him. In this battle, Bodhisattva Eastluck had actually been given
full control over a large formation. But…just now, that dazzlingly
talented Bodhisattva Eastluck had also died in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had been given
enough time, it was entirely possible that the Buddhist Sangha
would’ve gained yet another Buddha into their ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, this was destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how talented
you were or how much of a genius you were, if you weren’t given
enough time to grow you still wouldn’t become a ‘major power’.
Dying in a titanic battle like this was like a single wave
disappearing into the sea, leaving behind no traces of its passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Lord Buddha
had enough time to grieve for each individual person. Far too many
were dying, and every single major power had to watch as quite a few
of their beloved disciples perished. Almost every Empyrean God and
True Immortal had taken on a major power as master, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. The legend of Nuwa
repairing the heavens is one of the oldest legends of Nuwa, and was
mentioned previously with regards to how Gonggong damaged the pillars
of Heaven, causing the skies to collapse.  ↩

Chapter 15 - The Battle for Karmic Luck (2)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">War was a cruel affair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals were all fighting in massive formations. Each of them
commanded many Celestial Immortals and a sea of Loose Immortals and
Fiendgods! Each time a formation was broken apart, a huge massacre
would follow! Only a few lucky individuals would be able to survive,
generally when allied Immortals and Fiendgods who were still in
formation managed to scoop them up into estate-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s eyes were
bloodshot. When he saw all this happen, he couldn’t help but wish
to charge into the fray himself as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he knew that
he had to remain calm. Although the numbers indicated that the Nuwa
Alliance’s losses were heavier than the Seamless Gate’s, that was
because the Seamless Gate was losing golems as well! As more and more
golems were destroyed, the Seamless Gate began to lose more and more
Immortals and Fiendgods as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
relaxed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Primaltwin had been
in the Heavengazer Tower the entire time. Just now, it had finally
mastered and unlocked the fourth level of the Triult Sword! As his
Primaltwin was now also an Ancestral Immortal, he now used up a
staggering amount of energy when he sped up time inside the tower.
Thus, his Primaltwin now merely maintained a rate of thirty times the
normal speed of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At twenty times the
normal speed of time, the Primaltwin was able to maintain an energy
equilibrium. At thirty times the normal speed of time, the Primaltwin
would need to occasionally consume spirit pills in order to stay
steady.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly three months
had passed in the outside world, but roughly eight years had passed
in the Heavengazer Tower. Finally, the fourth level had been
unlocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, the Triult
Swords will be slightly more powerful for me than they were for
Swordfather Triult,” Ning mused to himself. To be able to increase
his own power at such a critical moment in time was something which
pleased Ning greatly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war for karmic luck
continued. As more and more golems were destroyed, the Nuwa
Alliance’s advantage became increasingly apparent. However, the
Seamless Gate was quite resolute as well. They triaged their losses
whenever necessary, determined to give the Nuwa Alliance no chance at
all for a quick victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battles continued,
and the casualties continued to climb…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the 179th day of
battle, after roughly half a year had passed, the Nuwa Alliance had
lost a total of more than twenty thousand Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals! The Seamless Gate had also lost more than twenty thousand
as well! If this was a battle between mortal armies, such terrible
casualties could very well have caused a complete breakdown in moral,
resulting in one side collapsing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the two vast
armies continued to fight with utter bloodlust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends,
Keeper Everwood, Daomother Devilhand, Daofather Bloodswan, Old Man
Yuan, and the other major powers were all standing in the darkened
skies, watching as the battle proceeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare for the
Endwar,” the Lord of All Fiends sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endwar?”
Everyone present felt their hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
sent frantically, “Windfiend, we haven’t lost the war for karmic
luck yet. Our losses in Empyrean Gods and True Immortals are equal to
their losses. We can keep fighting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can, but can we
win?” The Lord of All Fiends asked her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daomother Devilhand
instantly fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
swept them all with his gaze. He sent mentally, “Things weren’t
so bad at the start, primarily because we had so many golems in
storage! But more and more of the golems have been destroyed. Over
the course of the past half year, we’ve lost nearly 90% of our
golem army! The formations of the Nuwa Alliance, however, remain as
powerful as ever. They completely suppress our formations in power.
We aren’t a match for them in terms of mobilizing True Immortals
and Empyrean Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate had to admit to this. The Nuwa Alliance’s formations
had been left behind by Mother Nuwa herself. Their formations were
superior, which meant that their Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
were able to join together more effectively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps certain
tactical schemes and traps can turn the course of battle, but the
enemy commander is Xuan Yuan. His control over their armies is
completely flawless; he doesn’t strive for brilliant victories, he
only seeks to make no mistakes. He fights against us in a frontal,
aboveboard manner, slowly draining our armies! He relies on his
superiority in numbers and his superior formations rather than
compete against us in tactical brilliance!” The Lord of All Fiends
shook his head. “Traps and schemes might be useful against another
commander, but we can forget about using them against Xuan Yuan when
he’s commanding troops in such a manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But our karmic luck
is weaker than theirs. The situation is disadvantageous to us.” The
black-robed Godking spoke out in worry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
lost many of the important Realmwars, resulting in their karmic luck
weakening. They were at a disadvantage in this battle as well. If
their karmic luck was to weaken even further, then during the Endwar
it would be much more difficult for them to use certain formations to
summon enough energy from Heaven and Earth. The Nuwa Alliance,
however, would find it easier to summon and maintain those
formations. It would be as if Heaven and Earth were both trying to
assist the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, our karmic luck
is a bit weaker right now…but if we keep fighting like this, we’ll
probably lose all of our karmic luck,” the Lord of All Fiends said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood?”
Daomother Devilhand looked towards the silent Keeper Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree with what
Windfiend said.” Keeper Everwood said slowly, “No matter what…we
have to start the Endwar at some point. Although it does seem as
though we still have a chance at winning the war for karmic
luck…that’s precisely why, if we attack now, we might be able to
catch the Nuwa Alliance off their guard. If we wait until we
completely lose the war, not only will we have even less karmic luck,
the Nuwa Alliance will be fully prepared as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let the last
battle begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t had the
chance to make the Nuwa Alliance pay for my child’s death yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms was
created by the collision of our Seamless Chaosworld and their Pangu
Chaosworld. Why, then, have they always put on airs of being the
‘true masters of the Three Realms’? I’ve been pissed off about
this for eons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate cast aside all their doubts and worries. Only one path
existed before them…that of battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
sent mentally, “Daoist Yuan, don’t end up becoming soft-hearted
when the battle starts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Old Man Yuan chuckled calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witherspike.” The
Lord of All Fiends sent a mental message deep into the darkness of
the Void, to a location where a dark-golden castle was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the castle,
Godfiend Witherspike was seated atop his throne as always. Smiling
coldly, he made his reply. “Don’t worry, Allfiend…if I don’t
intervene, your chances of winning the Endwar would be pathetically
low. I’ll definitely take part.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The Lord of
All Fiends looked calmly at the two vast armies battling before him.
“Transmit my orders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the major powers
of the Seamless Gate turned solemn, preparing to enter battle at a
moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between the
Immortal armies turned increasingly vicious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
major powers of the Nuwa Alliance all held their breaths, unable to
breathe as they saw so many familiar faces perish. They felt
tremendous pain in their hearts, but all they could do was watch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he felt pain,
Ning was still continuing to focus on attuning to his own body. He
continued to train in accordance with the [Solitary World God],
seeking to find that spark of insight in his own body so that he
could break through to become an Elder God. If he could become an
Elder God…given how he had the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] and [One
True Body] divine abilities, he would become a half-step World God.
In all the Three Realms, most likely only the mysterious, inscrutable
Lord of All Fiends would be a match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning desperately wanted
to make the breakthrough, and he had mastered the Heavenly Dao of
Water, but mastering a Heavenly Dao was just one of multiple
prerequisites for becoming an Elder God. In the Three Realms, quite a
few True Gods had mastered Heavenly Daos, and a good number of them
had been taught the [Unbound Elder God Visualization] technique.
However, Suiren was the only one to break through to become an Elder
God! From this, one could see how hard it was to become an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been unable to
find that spark of insight inside his body. Despite that, Ning had
never given up on trying. He continued to search for that spark at
all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SNOW SCORPION!!!”
Suddenly, an agonized cry rang out from behind Ning. It was Redsnow,
and he had a frantic, heartbroken look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow had left his
secluded meditation when Ning was fighting against the Primordial
Ruinworld. He had already broken through to become a True God!
Redsnow was staring at a distant Pangu Genesis Formation, one which
had already been broken apart. Empyrean God Snow Scorpion had been
inside that formation, and her body had been torn through by the
sharp claws of an Envoy of All Things. She died on the spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow Scorpion…”
Ning felt pain in his heart as well. Seven Empyrean Gods had followed
him from the Starseizer world…and one of the seven, Snow Scorpion,
had just perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Compared to Ning,
however, Redsnow felt far greater pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow and Snow
Scorpion had been the right and left arms of Daoist Threelives. He
would never be able to forget how the two had fought side-by-side for
countless years. The other Empyrean Gods and True Immortals under
Daoist Threelives’ command had all slowly trickled away, with only
a few remaining within the Starseizing Manor. Redsnow and Snow
Scorpion had stayed behind, and the two had long ago grown close to
each other. Although they didn’t formally join together to become
Dao-companions, they had lived alongside each other for so long that
they were like family.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Redsnow’s
eyes glistened with unshed tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a streak of
black light appeared in the distance. The streak of black light moved
faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos, charging straight
towards the vast armies of the Nuwa Alliance. This alpha strike had
been launched by the most terrifying figure of the Seamless Gate, the
Lord of All Fiends. He was simply far too fast when he attacked…but
the Nuwa Alliance had been watching vigilantly this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Daoist
Three Purities’ face changed and he immediately let out a furious
bellow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” All of the
major powers had been keeping their growing rage suppressed. Now,
they let it all explode outwards. True God Redsnow and the others had
bloodlusted eyes as all of them instantly went berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ALLFIEND!” Ning
and Suiren simultaneously let out angry howls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them were
the fastest on the Nuwa Alliance. When faced with the sudden attack
of the Lord of All Fiends, Ji Ning was actually the most suitable
candidate for defending against it, thanks to his mastery of the
[Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
executed the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique as well as the Sixth
Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]! The divine tattoos appeared on his
six enormous palms, filled with such power as to cause the entire
Void to shudder. They were like six titanic stormclouds that swept
through the skies, each palm surpassing the limits of the Heavenly
Daos as they struck towards the armies of the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that in terms of speed, he was still a bit inferior to the Lord of
All Fiends. Thus, he launched an attack in order to force the Lord of
All Fiends to withdraw his attack as he sent his six cloud-sized
palms towards the army of the Seamless Gate! In this way, he could
ensure that the Lord of All Fiends would have to withdraw his attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers of the
Seamless Gate stared ashen-faced at the six titanic stormclouds that
were descending towards them. The Lord of All Fiends had only struck
with a single sharp blade that moved like a streak of black light,
but Ji Ning had struck out with six gigantic palms. How many of them
would die to this strike?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Lord of
All Fiends frowned. The black streak of light curved in midair,
expanding to become hundreds of thousands of kilometers long as he
swung it towards Ning’s palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive blast could
be heard, and the incomparably powerful collision caused Ning to
uncontrollably fly backwards a few steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends’
body trembled momentarily as well. The weapon in his hand was a
strange, black-colored weaver’s shuttle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth and the Lord of All Fiends had exchanged blows. Now, all
the other major powers of the two alliances entered the fray as well.
Some began to take command over Envoys of All Things, some began to
take command over many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to assume
mighty formations…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battlefield quickly
transformed from the final battle over karmic luck to the true
Endwar!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So powerful.” Ji
Ning stared at the distant Lord of All Fiends, who continued to stand
there in midair. “He really is an Elder God. If I only use the
[Starseizing Hand], I’m at a complete disadvantage.” Even during
the Primordial Era, the man had been able to save the Seamless Gate
from the hands of a World God, Mother Nuwa. He was the person who the
Nuwa Alliance feared the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Shennong, and Fuxi began to take command
over the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals on their side. Kuafu,
Daoist Jade Cauldron, Xingtian, Exalted Celestial Carefree, and the
rest of the True Gods and Daofathers quickly took command over their
respective Empyrean Gods and True Immortals as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final battle!”
Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan’s voice rang out by the ears of every
single Immortal and Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Celestial
Immortals immediately waved their hands, putting away the Loose
Immortals and Fiendgods under their command. In the blink of an eye,
the previously countless throngs of Immortals and Fiendgods began to
dramatically sparsen and thin out. All of the weaker cultivators
vanished, while the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals then instantly
drew their tens of millions of Celestial Immortals into their
estate-treasures and estate-worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all of the
cultivators on the side of the Nuwa Alliance instantly disappeared,
leaving behind only the True Gods, Daofathers, Empyrean Gods, and
True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
gathered a total of 3600 Pure Yang True Immortals around him. A flood
of Immortal energy began to activate, drawing upon enormous amounts
of natural energy. Given Daoist Three Purities’ abilities, the
energy was instantly formed into an enormous formation. The illusory
image of a titanic Daoist Three Purities appeared above the
formation, and beneath the feet of the illusion was an enormous deep
azure diagram. Four Chaos swords floated around the illusion, one in
each direction, their auras filling the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa Heaven
Repairing Formation!” The major powers of the Seamless Gate
hurriedly took control over their formations as well, with some
entering their Envoys of All Things. However, when they saw the
enormous formation which the distant Daoist Three Purities had just
created, they couldn’t help but feel their hearts quaver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had left
behind three ‘guardian formations’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did this term
‘guardian formation’ truly represent?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa was worried
about more alien Outsiders invading in the future, and so she spent
enormous amounts of effort to develop these three guardian
formations. Only then did she feel confident enough to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the war for the
Deerchaser world, the Nuwa Alliance had put one of their three
guardian formations on display, the Pangu Genesis Formation. However,
that time they merely had True Immortal Jimin command the formation,
and his formation only held a total of around five hundred Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals. It could be considered a simplified version
of the Pangu Genesis Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Daoist Three
Purities was now serving as the core of a massive formation with 3600
Pure Yang True Immortals, forming a perfect Nuwa Heaven Repairing
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single movement
he made was filled with the power of Heaven and Earth. He was every
bit as powerful as a true first-tier Ancestral Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to that,
Daoist Three Purities had an extremely high level of insight into the
Dao, and his Immortal Slaying Swords were tremendously powerful. One
could imagine how deadly he was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Lord
Tathagata folded his hands together in prayer. Around him were
exactly 5800 Empyrean Gods, and they too began to summon an
overwhelming amount of natural energy from Heaven and Earth. A
titanic body was quickly formed around them, but it still had the
appearance of Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This formation was the
guardian formation known as the ‘Pangu Genesis Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been manifested
through the power of 5800 Empyrean Gods, with Tathagata serving as
the core. The Pangu God created by this formation was every bit as
powerful as any Elder God! Given Tathagata’s insights into the Dao
and formidable palm-arts, it could be said that he did not need to
fear anyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.” Fuxi also took command over 3600 Pure Yang True
Immortals to assemble a second Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.” Shennong took control over 5800 Empyrean Gods to form a
second Pangu Genesis Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Exalted
Celestial Carefree commanded a total of 2200 Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals, using them to form the ‘Origin of Duality Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three mighty guardian
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Genesis
Formation used Empyrean Gods to form a Pangu God which was adept at
close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Heaven
Repairing Formation used True Immortals to manifest tremendous
amounts of Immortal energy that could be used to launch long distance
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Origin of Duality
Formation was an extremely durable formation. It could be used on the
battlefield to deal with the most dangerous situations. It could be
placed wherever it was needed! It could launch long range attacks but
could also tank attacks at close range!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three guardian
formations were incredibly powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if alien Outsiders
with the power of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals invaded, the
Nuwa Alliance would be able to rely on these three guardian
formations and their profound insights into the Dao to fight back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
assembled into formations, but the Seamless Gate was doing the same.
They had many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals as well, and they also
had their Envoys of All Things…but when they saw the three guardian
formations of the Nuwa Alliance reveal their full power for the first
time, they couldn’t help but quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord, our
karmic luck is weak while their karmic luck is strong. Our major
powers are drawing far less natural energy than theirs!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our karmic luck is
weak and our formations are weak…the difference is simply
enormous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the
Seamless Gate was beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew that the Nuwa
Alliance had three powerful guardian formations, but the Nuwa
Alliance had never truly revealed them in the past! The versions they
had previously seen were all just simplified versions. Daoist Three
Purities, Tathagata, and the others had never personally taken
command over those formations. Now that they had, the Seamless Gate
was shivering in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about the
Seamless Gate; even the highly experienced Godfiend Witherspike had
an ashen look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to fight.”
Godfiend Witherspike was in charge of his retainers and the alien
Outsiders of the Primordial Ruinworld, and he was about to command
them to attack, but…upon seeing the enormous formations the Nuwa
Alliance had just set up, he was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation…”
Godfiend Witherspike previously always had a calm look on his face,
but he could no longer remain calm. Awestruck, he said, “Nuwa…she
was just a local aboriginal, right? And she left the Three Realms
shortly after becoming a World God. A new World God who didn’t have
much tutelage…how the hell could she have created three formations
of such power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is trouble.”
The nearby Saber said in a low voice, “Master, these locals are
much weaker than us, but that’s primarily because they are all just
True Gods and third-tier Ancestral Immortals. Now that they’ve
assembled these so-called ‘guardian formations’, they have become
dramatically stronger. Look at Tathagata over there. That ‘Pangu
God’ he’s created definitely has the power of an Elder God.
Combined with his palm-arts…even if the two of us joined together,
we wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Godfiend
Witherspike nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata was highly
skilled in defense. Even in the Primordial Ruinworld, when the two
had joined forces they had only been able to injure him, not capture
him. Now that Tathagata had the body of a Pangu God, he could
absolutely be described as invincible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These local
‘overlords’ all have incredible insights into the Dao. They had
just one weakness…and its just been covered by their formations.”
Saber frowned. “They are not easy to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just KNEW that a
chaosworld that gave birth to a World God wouldn’t be so easy to
invade.” Godfiend Witherspike gritted his teeth. “Let’s watch
for now and see how the Seamless Gate reacts. If they get completely
manhandled, we’ll give up on our schemes and leave right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Saber
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Godfiend
Witherspike and Saber both had ultimate attacks that they had yet to
use, when they saw the true power of the Nuwa Alliance they
understood that even if they used everything they had, they still
wouldn’t be able to take over the Three Realms. It was best to see
what the Seamless Gate had up its sleeve first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
panicking…but it had no options but to fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata, Three
Purities, Fuxi, and Shennong. Don’t worry about the formations they
are in command of. All of you, go deal with the formations led by the
other True Gods and Daofathers,” the Lord of All Fiends immediately
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate all heaved sighs of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
quite a few major powers on its side as well, especially after Old
Man Yuan had led the Four Ancestors of the River Source into their
alliance. These major powers had two types of large formations of
their own to use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them involved
three True Gods to take control over 3900 Empyrean Gods in the
‘Infinity Fiendgod Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other involved six
Daofathers taking control over 5100 True Immortals to form a
‘Ragnarok Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the two
mighty formations which Keeper Everwood had come up with after
spending countless years of effort. However, these formations were
far weaker than the ones which Mother Nuwa had devised. The Ragnarok
Formation, for example; it required six Daofathers and 5100 True
Immortals, but the ‘Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation’ was
stronger, even though it only required a single Daofather and 3600
True Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…the
more powerful the commander, the more powerful the formation. There
was a huge gap in power between a formation commanded by Daoist Three
Purities and a formation commanded by an ordinary Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Purities, Fuxi,
Shennong, and Tathagata had each taken control over a formation. If
the Seamless Gate’s Daofathers didn’t need to worry about those
four formations, they felt much more confident in their chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can ignore the
nastiest ones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have nine Envoys
as well. We can at least give the Nuwa Alliance a good fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…I wonder
how the Fiendlord and the others are planning to deal with those
terrifying formations of the Nuwa Alliance.” The major powers of
the Seamless Gate continued to worry.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance was
not going to show any mercy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
formations were established, they immediately began to press the
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Daoist
Three Purities, in command of a Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation,
pointed from far away, his aura towering to the heavens. Instantly,
his four Immortal Slaying Swords joined together to form a single
titanic sword that chopped downwards towards the grand army of the
Seamless Gate. The tip of the giant sword instantly caused the Void
to break apart, and the terrifying aura of power around the sword
caused all the major power to feel their hearts grow cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a killer
formation.” The faces of both Godfiend Witherspike and Saber were
rather ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ji Ning sighed in
shock upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his Primaltwin
was a first-tier Ancestral Immortal and capable of unleashing
tremendous power with the Triult Swords, it wouldn’t be like this.
Daoist Three Purities had acquired the Immortal Slaying Swords far
too long ago, and he himself had developed the sword-diagram linking
the four together! Daoist Three Purities was also at a higher level
of insight and understanding than Ning. Thus when he used the
Immortal Slaying Swords, the power of his attacks could be described
as truly unequalled in all the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Purities!” A
loud roar rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wooden ruler suddenly
expanded in size, becoming so gigantic that it seemed to completely
block out the skies themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gigantic sword
collided with the massive wooden ruler, the collision completely
obliterating the Void around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
stared at the distant violet-robed figure, then said in a cold voice,
“Everwood, I’ve never been able to get a good handle on the Lord
of All Fiend’s power. The other one I was unsure about was you. You
really did hide your power very well. You’ve actually become an
Elder God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood’s
face was turning slightly pale. The Immortal Slaying Swords were
simply far too strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to waste
words.” Keeper Everwood immediately attacked once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Daoist
Three Purities once more sent his Immortal Slaying Sword Formation to
strike at Keeper Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood was
proficient in almost every aspect. Treasure forging, formation
setting, attack, defense…he seemed to be skilled in everything. His
talent was such that even Lord Demonheart felt great admiration for
him. The two most dazzling figures in the Seamless Chaosworld had
been the Keeper of the Everwood and the Lord of the Demonheart!
Keeper Everwood simply didn’t have any taste for power. Despite
that, after the battle that ended the Primordial Era he managed to
make a breakthrough to become an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t have any
guidance from others, much like how Mother Nuwa wasn’t guided by
anyone to become a World God. The same was true for Keeper Everwood.
He simply had such a powerful foundation and many profound insights
into many different fields. After being ‘baptized’ by the war
that ended the Primordial Era, he ended up becoming an Elder God. He
simply never revealed it to anyone else…but today, during the
Endwar, he finally did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, Daoist Three
Purities’ ‘Immortal Slaying Sword Formation’ was simply too
savage. Even though Keeper Everwood was an Elder God, he was only
able to just barely withstand the formation’s attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame
Apocalypse - Yin-Yang Birth and Destruction!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuxi was in command of
a Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation as well, and he immediately
executed his strongest technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An area of a hundred
million kilometers around him became instantly transformed into a sea
of water and fire. Seemingly endless amounts of Arcane Moonwater and
Eternal Kindlefire filled the emptiness of the Void, and the
formations and Envoys of the Seamless Gate instantly felt as though
their bodies had been trapped in quicksand. Their movements were all
affected, and their speed was dramatically lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the water
and fire joined together to form a gigantic Taiji diagram in front of
the Lord of All Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water was used to
represent Yin, while fire was used to represent Yang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water represented life,
fire represented destruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his previous life,
Fuxi was Elder God Fuxi, after all. He was born with mastery over the
Heavenly Dao of Destruction. In this life, he had worked hard to
understand the Heavenly Dao of Life, so as to be able to recover his
memories from his past life. Thus, he was quite talented in both of
these Heavenly Daos, and he had of course long ago mastered the
Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why the true
killer technique of his ‘Waterflame Apocalypse Formation’ was
this technique, the ‘Yin-Yang Birth and Destruction’ technique.
If he was to master the Heavenly Daos of Life and Destruction, the
power of this attack would increase dramatically. Even now, thanks to
the power of the Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation, this technique
possessed extraordinary power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The robes of
the Lord of All Fiends fluttered, causing a series of concentric
ripples to spread out around him and defend against the attacking
Taiji diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Shennong,
in control of a Pangu Genesis Formation and protected by a Pangu God,
also flew forward and attacked the Seamless Gate. He had mastered the
Five Elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and was
exceedingly powerful in close combat as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Suiren no
longer held back his overwhelming powerful aura either. He completely
unleashed his Elder God aura as he charged towards the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an Elder God!
Suiren is an Elder God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually an
Elder God?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
stunned. The only ‘natural’ Elder God on their side was the Lord
of All Fiends. The other one was Keeper Everwood, a genius who spent
countless years cultivating before also reaching that level. As the
Seamless Gate saw it, advancing from True God to Elder God was
incredibly difficult. There were no techniques that could teach
someone to make this breakthrough, after all. The only reason why
Keeper Everwood had been able to do so was because he had such a
deep, well-rounded foundation in every single aspect of the Dao. They
felt that the Nuwa Alliance wouldn’t be able to accomplish the
same…but they were wrong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” The
stooped, gray-robed figure suddenly straightened his body, lifting
his head up and revealing a heavily bearded face. His eyes were
filled with boundless killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His aura towered to the
heavens as he charged towards the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Gonggong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God Gonggong.
He actually didn’t die?!” The Seamless Gate instantly recognized
him. Elder God Gonggong had displayed his might during the war that
ended the Primordial Era, after all. But everyone in the Three Realms
had believed Gonggong to be dead. It was said that he had been slain
by an alien Outsider, and he hadn’t shown himself in countless
years. In the end, the Seamless Gate came to truly believe that Elder
God Gonggong had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one imagined that he
was still alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First Suiren, now
Gonggong. The Nuwa Alliance actually has two Elder Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hatchet in hand, Houyi
no longer held back. His aura completely burst forward, sweeping
through Heaven and Earth with as much power as the auras of Gonggong
and Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the most
dazzlingly, peerlessly talented figure of the Primordial Era. After
he gained Mother Nuwa’s [Unbound Elder God Visualization], he had
trained to become an Elder God as well. In the entire Nuwa Alliance,
only two figures had been able to train in the [Unbound Elder God
Visualization] to become Elder Gods. The first was Suiren, while the
second was Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-six icy lotuses
had appeared in the air around Ning, and they were freezing all the
opponents around him. Fuxi’s ‘Waterflame Apocalypse Formation’
focused on large-scale attacks, which was why it wasn’t that
powerful in terms of constricting any specific individual. Ji Ning,
however, was a first-tier Ancestral Immortal, and his Frozen Lotuses
of the Thirty-Six Heavens covered a much smaller region, allowing for
much more concentrated power than Fuxi’s formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wherever the icy
lotuses flew past, snow fluttered about. Ning wielded Violetjewel in
his hand, sending his sword-ki flying everywhere and bringing terror
to the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestral Immortal?
A first-tier Ancestral Immortal?” As Godfiend Witherspike watched
from afar, his face instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually a
first-tier Ancestral Immortal.” Saber was shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance’s
foundation is far too deep. Weren’t they supposed to have no Elder
Gods at all? How the hell did they gain three Elder Gods and an
Ancestral Immortal on top of those guardian formations!?” Godfiend
Witherspike felt true pressure now. The three guardian formations had
only made him feel that any assault would be unlikely to succeed, but
now he felt as though he was staring at a steel plate that was
waiting for him to kick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.” Godfiend
Witherspike growled, “Let’s keep waiting. We probably aren’t
strong enough to fight back against either side. The only thing we
can do is wait and hope that the Seamless Gate is strong enough to
fight back. If both sides are badly injured…perhaps the Seamless
Gate will deal the Nuwa Alliance a heavy-enough blow that I’ll have
a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Saber nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the primordial
chaos, taking advantage of a chaotic scene to gain benefits for one’s
self was an extremely common tactic. It was far too difficult to
crush someone with overwhelming power! Before this, Godfiend
Witherspike had thought that there would be no way the Three Realms
could resist his ultimate attack, but now he saw that he had been far
too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance’s
morale was skyrocketing. Their formations were incredible, and they
had multiple Elder Gods who had just shown themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jueming, why haven’t
you entered a formation yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance had all entered into their respective formations,
taking command over their Empyrean Gods and True Immortals. The
weaker Daofathers would join together in groups of four to five and
jointly lead a formation. Daoist Three Purities was able to easily
command a Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation by himself, but ordinary
Daofathers wouldn’t be able to unleash the formation in its perfect
state. If two or three other Daofathers were to join in, they would
be able to work together to unleash the full power of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amitabha.” Buddha
Jueming folded his hands together in prayer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying aura that
was every bit as powerful as the auras given off by Ji Ning, Suiren,
Gonggong, and Houyi instantly blasted through the Void. Buddha
Jueming slowly walked through the Void, each step causing space to
twist and distort as he walked towards the Seamless Gate. “Vile
Seamless creatures, you should be sent into the endless hells.” His
eyes no longer held any mercy in them at all, only adamantine rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jueming is also an
Elder God?” The major powers, Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals of
the Nuwa Alliance were all shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!” Daoist
Three Purities, Tathagata, Fuxi, and Suiren all revealed looks of joy
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I thought.”
Ning smiled upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand army of the
Nuwa Alliance charged straight towards the Seamless Gate. They were
led by Gonggong, Houyi, Ji Ning, Jueming, and Suiren - four Elder
Gods, one Ancestral Immortal. In addition to them, there was also the
formation-commanding Daoist Three Purities, Fuxi, Shennong, and
Tathagata. All of these terrifying figures came surging forward,
bringing utter terror to the hearts of the Seamless Gate.

Chapter 18 - A Bloody Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The overlords of the
Seamless Gate all had ashen looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had made extensive
and careful preparations for this fight, but the might which the Nuwa
Alliance had just displayed was just too strong. Five Elder God-level
combatants had just appeared out of nowhere! Just one or two, the
Seamless Gate would’ve been able to deal with, but now? They had
instantly been pushed to the edges of the cliff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Old Man Yuan
let out a sigh, then sent mentally, “Allfiend, I’ll do what I
promised I would do. However, there’s no way I can change the
overall situation by myself. Leave Gonggong to me. Deal with the rest
yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan
transformed into a streak of light, flying straight towards Gonggong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Gonggong’s
eyes were filled with murder as he stared at Old Man Yuan. He roared
angrily, “Daoist Yuan, you traitor…die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who will kill me?
You?” Old Man Yuan’s horsetail whisk struck out, causing
countless strands of white hairs to flew towards Elder God Gonggong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and the one-armed Saber watched from the sidelines. Right at this
moment, the Lord of All Fiend’s voice rang out by their ears. “The
situation looks grim. Do you plan to give up or do you plan to help
us out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help out. Of course
we will help out,” Godfiend Witherspike replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi, Ji Ning,
Jueming, Suiren. Choose two of these four,” the Lord of All Fiends
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and Saber immediately made their decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning? He was too
hard to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren? He actually
also had the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]. He was also too hard to
deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi? Intriguing. They
hadn’t fought against him either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jueming? He’d hidden
his true power quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave Houyi and
Jueming to us,” Godfiend Witherspike replied. The two transformed
into streaks of light, charging towards the Nuwa Alliance. These two
had battled countless times in the primordial chaos; to exchange
blows with Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals was a commonplace event
and they felt no pressure whatsoever. Still…since they had chosen
to get involved in this fight, they still had to give it their best
shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go stop
Shennong,” Daofather Ink Bamboo sent, then moved to engage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” The
Lord of All Fiends sighed quietly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the battle that
destroyed the Primordial Era, the Seamless Gate had given birth to
overlords of its own. Bloodswan and Ink Bamboo were two examples! As
for Everwood, he had actually broken through to become an Elder God.
Of course, all these things were kept highly secret. Daofather Ink
Bamboo had always been a very low-key figure. Long ago, he had
followed the Lord of the Demonheart as a loyal retainer. Later, when
the black-robed Godking became the nominal leader of the Seamless
Gate, he had willingly carried out tasks on the Godking’s behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one realized that
this loyal, devoted servant, this ordinary Daofather, would actually
come to possess the power of an overlord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata did so by
mastering the Five Elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth!
Fuxi had mastered the Heavenly Daos of Yin and Yang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Daofather Ink
Bamboo was different!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had grafted his
insights into the Seamless Chaosworld’s Heavenly Daos of Earth and
Water with the Three Realms’ Heavenly Dao of Wood, joining them
together into a seamless whole. This allowed him to reach an utterly
inconceivably high level of insight into the Dao of Wood. Much like
how Ning had reached a shocking level of power thanks to his skill in
the Dao of the Sword, Daofather Ink Bamboo’s mastery over the Dao
of Wood had allowed him to become an overlord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The skies
became filled with giant stalks of bamboo, all of which reached out
towards Shennong’s Pangu Genesis Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodswan,
Devilhand, the two of you go deal with Tathagata,” the Lord of All
Fiends instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Daomother Devilhand and Daofather Bloodswan didn’t hesitate at all,
immediately charging towards Tathagata. If they had to fight against
Tathagata by themselves, they truly wouldn’t have felt any
confidence at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why
Daofather Ink Bamboo dared to fight Shennong by himself was partially
because Shennong wasn’t that skilled in close combat. In addition,
Daofather Ink Bamboo was skilled in defense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. While Daofather
Bloodswan flew forward, a second body suddenly appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were now two of
him; one in black robes, the other in blood robes. Both bodies were
at the overlord level of power. Daomother Devilhand was by his side
as well, and the three of them jointly struck out towards Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Lord of All
Fiends, his divine body suddenly split apart into two different
bodies. The two Lord of All Fiends separately attacked Ji Ning and
Suiren!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all this took
time to described, it actually all occurred in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood, Old
Man Yuan, Godfiend Witherspike, Saber, Daofather Ink Bamboo,
Daofather Bloodswan, Daomother Devilhand, and the Lord of All Fiends
attacked in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood,
Godfiend Witherspike, Saber, and the Lord of All Fiends were actual
Elder Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan and
Daofather Ink Bamboo were both extremely skilled in defensive
techniques, guaranteeing that even though they were somewhat weaker
they would still be able to hold on in the face of enemy attacks.
This was much like how Tathagata had been able to hold on for a long
period of time against Godfiend Witherspike, Saber, and an entire
host of Outsider major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Daofather
Bloodswan’s two bodies joined together with Daomother Devilhand,
they formed quite a formidable team.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die…all of you can
go die…” Elder God Gonggong’s long hair fluttered about as he
smashed at Old Man Yuan with his staff in a berserk manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan
continuously focused on defense, blocking the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know that
I hate traitors like you the most,” Elder God Gonggong bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Old Man
Yuan just smirked calmly, not deigning to respond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard you are
pretty good with the bow.” Godfiend Witherspike stood there in
midair, chuckling as he faced the hatchet-wielding Houyi. “Why
don’t you show me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think you merit
it?” Houyi suddenly charged forward, his aura bursting with power
as he raised his hatchet up high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene caused
Godfiend Witherspike to feel a slight hint of terror. He felt as
though he was facing a terrifyingly powerful World God who was
chopping down at him with an axe. Still, Godfiend Witherspike was
able to remain quite calm. His tail rapidly expanded in size as well,
striking out like a giant whip that lashed out at the upraised
hatchet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
was knocked slightly backwards, while Houyi’s body came to a halt
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite powerful.”
Godfiend Witherspike chuckled, then let out a sigh. “This is a bit
interesting. Your heartforce really is strong; I nearly succumbed to
your blow just now. Fortunately, I’m quite experienced myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Houyi just
advanced coldly, continuing to swing his hatchet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one-armed Saber was
battling against Buddha Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzlingly brilliant
golden palm came flying through the air, and it knocked Saber
backwards. Saber’s eyes gleamed as he stared at Buddha Jueming, a
hint of excitement in his gaze. “Your Three Realms has the
so-called ‘Buddhist Sangha’. I’ve tangled with your Buddhist
overlord, ‘Tathagata’. Your palm-arts are quite similar to his,
and even your palms are like top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
However, your palm-strikes are even more powerful than his!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only because I have
strong enough divine power.” Buddha Jueming replied calmly. His
eyes were ice cold, and he continued to slam down with his mighty
palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Buddhists were all
skilled in palm-arts. After Jueming became a Buddha, Lord Tathagata
had naturally imparted many Buddhist secret arts and divine abilities
to him. Buddha Jueming had meditated on these secret arts, then
joined those insights to his [Nine Elements Annihilation]. He had
spent countless years in order to develop a palm-art divine ability
that was every bit as strong as Lord Tathagata’s; in fact, in terms
of raw explosive power, it was actually superior! Now that he was an
Elder God, this set of palm-arts allowed him to unleash the power of
a truly elite Elder God. His only weakness was that his insights into
the Dao weren’t as profound as Tathagata’s, making his palm-arts
less perfect. Despite that, his advantage in raw power as an Elder
God made it so that when he used this palm-art, his strikes were
truly devastating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, even Saber was
kept at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
commanded his Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation to use his Immortal
Slaying Swords to attack the Elder God ‘Keeper Everwood’, who
found it difficult to endure his blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata
commanded his Pangu Genesis Formation to fight against Daofather
Bloodswan and Daomother Devilhand, who also were just barely able to
hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong was in command
of another Pangu Genesis Formation, but Daofather Ink Bamboo had
managed to tie him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren’s strikes with
his wooden staff were filled with incredible, extraordinary power.
Each time he struck out with his staff, an ferocious burst of flame
would erupt with absolutely devastating might. Even the Lord of All
Fiends was forced to dodge, rather than take those attacks head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Allfiend, is dodging
all you can do? Is that all you dare do?” Suiren roared angrily. He
was quite fast, but the Lord of All Fiends was even faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we were fighting
one-on-one, of course I’d fight you head-on. Right now, I only have
part of my full power; a head-on fight isn’t in my favor.” The
Lord of All Fiends flew about unpredictably, continuously circling
around Suiren and ensuring that Suiren wouldn’t dare to act rashly.
Although he had divided his body in two, causing both bodies to be
slightly weaker than his normal body, each body could still just
barely be considered as having the power of an elite Elder God. If
Suiren acted rashly, he would still be in danger of dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, only
someone like the Lord of All Fiends, the physically fastest combatant
in all the Three Realms, would dare to divide his body in half at a
time like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was facing off
against a Lord of All Fiends as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord of All Fiends,
you split your body in two? I imagine that each body only has a
portion of your true might.” Ning shook his head. “You
underestimate me too much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ning
suddenly appeared next to the white-robed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
charged towards Daofather Ink Bamboo, while the black-robed Ning
charged towards Daomother Devilhand.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_19___Executed"></A>
Chapter 19 - Executed
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The Lord of
All Fiends’ face turned pale. His body surged forward like a gust
of wind, quickly flying towards the black-robed Ji Ning. He knew
exactly how formidable Ji Ning’s true body was; it was as tough as
a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure and was simply unbreakable.
By comparison, the Primaltwin should be much easier to deal with, as
it had a much more fragile body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The
black-robed Ning turned his head to stare icily at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three streaks of
sword-light flew out from his forehead. Those three streaks of
sword-light moved in a unpredictable, ghostly fashion, and all three
of them surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos. They swirled
around the region, completely halting the Lord of All Fiends in his
tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” After testing
those swords out, the Lord of All Fiends immediately felt a headache
impending. Ji Ning was a first-tier Ancestral Immortal who was
controlling Chaos-level swords that moved faster than the limits of
the Heavenly Daos. The swords flew around Ning like a circle, with
Ning being the center of that circle. They only had to defend against
any attacks that drew close to that center, and if the Lord of All
Fiends wanted to breach their defenses he would have to attack much
faster than they moved. But…there were three of those swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And that wasn’t the
worst part of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The worst part of it
was that thirty-six frozen lotuses had appeared around the area,
spinning about and releasing streams of frozen energy, dramatically
impacating the Lord of All Fiends. Even if he was at the peak of his
power, he would still find it difficult to penetrate Ning’s
defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning had yet
to reveal his Blackcloud Chains. Once he did, his defenses would
become absolutely and completely imperveious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
he acquire this set of swords? How can they be so powerful?” The
Lord of All Fiends tried multiple times to break through Ning’s
defenses, only to discover how formidably sharp and fierce the set of
three swords was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t able to
stop the black-robed Ning, which meant the black-robed Ning was free
to continue charging towards Daomother Devilhand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the white-robed
Ning, he moved forward at high speed using his Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no choice but
to go stop his true body instead.” The Lord of All Fiends moved at
maximum speed towards the white-robed Ning. The two were originally
quite far away from each other, but the distance between the two
could be visibly seen shrinking! Before the white-robed Ning had
reached Daofather Ink Bamboo, the Lord of All Fiends had once more
appeared before him, stopping him in his tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t stop
me.” Ning laughed coldly, “The Seamless Gate is doomed to lose
for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
couldn’t help but sigh to himself as well. Indeed. Upon discovering
how many terrifying overlords the Nuwa Alliance had, he had wracked
his brains for solutions and had gone so far as to split his own body
in half, so that he could stop the two fastest enemy overlords, Ji
Ning and Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…in the end,
it wasn’t enough. Ji Ning had a second body of his own, one which
most likely also had the combat power of an elite Daofather!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That second body was
the final straw that broke the camel’s back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate
simply had no more extra power it could squeeze out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we retreat
right away?” This thought flashed past the Lord of All Fiend’s
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were to retreat
now…he was fast, but it would still take him time to rescue
everyone one-by-one. If the Nuwa Alliance seized the opportunity to
press the assault, the Seamless Gate would definitely lose a large
number of Immortals and Fiendgods, but it would only make up a small
fraction of their total forces. If things went on for too long, they
would probably lose even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet. The reasons
behind this war have yet to be revealed,” the Lord of All Fiends
mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To this very day,
neither side truly understood what the cause of this war was. In
addition, the alien Outsider known as Godfiend Witherspike still had
yet to display his true power. Everything still seemed quite odd. The
Lord of All Fiends wanted to watch and wait for a bit longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofathers,
Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals continued to battle in the Void.
One of the Infinity Fiendgod Formations of the Seamless Gate broke
apart, and the three True Gods and 3900 Empyrean Gods inside of it
were thrown into a state of chaos. The Nuwa Alliance naturally seized
the opportunity to butcher them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whenever a formation
was broken apart, a large-scale massacre would immediately occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longer the Endwar
continued, the more major powers, Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals
would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The
black-robed Ning stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two crystalline swords
and a golden sword came together, forming a triangle as they shot
towards Daomother Devilhand and Daofather Bloodswan’s two clones.
The three of them were currently battling Lord Tathagata, and as
Ning’s three swords flew towards them, the divine runes atop the
swords began to manifest and glow. The three swords quickly began to
transform, melting together like mist to form a single
semi-translucent golden sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the
semi-translucent golden sword appeared, a faint aura of sword-ki
manifested around it for a million kilometers, causing everyone on
the battlefield to feel astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That sharp aura of
light was simply too ferocious. It was completely comparable to that
of the Immortal Slaying Swords of Daoist Three Purities! Daoist Three
Purities’ Immortal Slaying Swords were capable of causing
tremendous difficulties for even a defensive specialist like Keeper
Everwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ‘Triult
Sword Formation’ flew straight towards Daomother Devilhand and
Daofather Bloodswan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. Flee!”
The faces of Daomother Devilhand and Daofather Bloodswan both
changed. They could tell that Ning was specifically targeting the two
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about leaving.” Lord Tathagata’s palms came crashing down upon
them, seeking to bar their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Daomother
Devilhand and Daofather Bloodswan were in no mood to fight him any
longer. When they saw the power of the Triult Swords soaring towards
them, they instantly knew that this wasn’t something they could
fight back against. Right now on the field of battle, the most
offensively powerful attack as the Immortal Slaying Swords of Daoist
Three Purities’, who was in command of a Nuwa Heaven Repairing
Formation. The second was the terrifying unknown sword-formation
which the black-robed Ji Ning had just unleashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee in separate
directions.” Daofather Bloodswan’s two bodies and Daomother
Devilhand fled in three completely different directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The semi-translucent
golden sword continued to fly after Daomother Devilhand! It was best
to pull up grass by the roots. Daomother Devilhand didn’t have any
clones; if she could be killed, she would be permanently slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then!” The
fleeing Daomother Devilhand understood what was happening. She knew
that she wouldn’t be able to outrun that terrifying sword, and so
she turned, a calm look on her face, to watch as the sword-light
descended upon her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was dressed in
violet robes, and she was as beautiful as any fairy maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, she was the
most terrifyingly devil of the entire Seamless Chaosworld. She calmly
struck out with her jade-white arms, using them to block the incoming
streak of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Daofather
Bloodswan had fled far off into the distance. When he saw this
happen, his face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devilhand!” Keeper
Everwood grew frantic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Lord of All
Fiends saw this, all he could do was sigh softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She managed to block
the blow. Her twin palms, covered by a pair of Chaos gloves, had
actually managed to block the semi-translucent golden sword. However,
the sword-strike had carried far too much power within it. The force
of the collision instantly caused Daomother Devilhand’s body to
quiver, and she couldn’t help but vomit out a mouthful of blood. In
the next instant…the semi-translucent golden sword hacked down
again in an unpredictable, ghostly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before she died,
Daomother Devilhand was able to strike out a total of eight times,
blocking eight of those sword-attacks. On the ninth sword attack, the
sword-light swiped past her neck…and as it did so it completely
annihilated the rest of her body. Her body evaporated like a
snowflake in the sun, completely disintegrating into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was simply too obvious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene caused
terror to fill the hearts of all the major powers of the Seamless
Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Did she just die?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was Daomother
Devilhand! A legendary woman who was known as a devil amongst devils
in the Seamless Chaosworld. This legendary figure who had once
exchanged blows against Mother Nuwa herself…had died, just like
that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But when they thought
of the sword-formation Ji Ning had just displayed, every member of
the Seamless Gate shook in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raw power alone,
perhaps only the Immortal Slaying Swords could match it. Technically,
the Immortal Slaying Swords might be a bit more powerful, but the
important thing was that Ji Ning’s ‘Triult Swords’ were much
faster than the Immortal Slaying Swords! The Triult Swords were being
used to display Ji Ning’s sword-arts, the most supreme sword-arts
of the Three Realms. After twenty thousand years of polishing, Ning’s
sword-arts had reached a truly inconceivable level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord, we can’t
hold on any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
less karmic luck to begin with, making it so that their formations
were able to summon significantly less natural energy from Heaven and
Earth. Daomother Devilhand’s death, combined with the fact that no
one was able to bar the path of the black-robed Ning, caused the
morale of the Seamless Gate to dramatically plummet. Two more of
their formations were broken in quick succession, resulting in the
deaths of the nine True Gods/Daofathers and ten thousand Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals in them. It was an absolute massacre…and
now, Ji NIng was chasing after Daofather Bloodswan. The situation was
growing grimmer and grimmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have we lost, just
like that?” The Lord of All Fiends truly didn’t wish to accept
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had known right away
that Devilhand was going to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the moment that he
had been unable to stop the black-robed Ji Ning from advancing, he
had known that Daomother Devilhand was definitely going to perish.
However, the degree to which things were worsening was causing the
Lord of All Fiends to grow frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly is the
cause of all this mayhem?” The Lord of All Fiends suddenly detected
a subtle ripple of power. His face instantly changed. “This is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance’s
morale was skyrocketing even further!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had five new
overlords, the three guardian formations, and superior karmic luck.
Although the Seamless Gate had gone all out to recruit new allies,
bringing Old Man Yuan and the two Elder Gods of the Primordial
Ruinworld into their fold, in the end…this short initial clash had
already brought the Seamless Gate to the breaking point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata, Ji
Ning, and the others sought to widen the scope of the massacre and
slay even more of them. But right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…an extremely
minute ripple of power spread out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single major
power, Empyrean God, and True Immortal on the battlefield could sense
it, because the source of this ripple came from the Heavenly Daos.
The ripple quickly began to grow more powerful, causing all of the
Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms to begin to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to stop me?
Three Realms, you aren’t able to do so!” A furious roar rang out
in every single part of the Three Realms, causing all of the Heavenly
Daos to shake.

Chapter 20 - Escaping the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That voice…it
sounded like the voice of the heavens themselves.” The countless
denizens of the Three Realms, human and monster alike, stared
questioningly at the skies. The weaker ones were confused, while the
powerful cultivators and Diremonsters were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the two battling
armies in the Void, their experts and major powers were similarly
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ji
Ning and the others all felt fear in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entirety of the
Three Realms was trembling. Heaven and Earth were thundering and
shaking. Even the Void itself was booming! It was as though some
invisible creature was attempting to tear the Three Realms asunder.
This surge of power caused the major powers of the Nuwa Alliance, who
had held the upper hand in the Endwar thus far, to have a bad
feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ignore him. Wipe out
the Seamless Gate first,” Daoist Three Purities barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wipe them out
first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
pointed, causing the semi-translucent golden sword to rapidly swing
towards the distant army of the Seamless Gate. The sword energy
stretched out a million kilometers, aimed at a Ragnarok Formation
that was formed by six Daofathers and 5100 True Immortals. Rings of
black light swirled around the Ragnarok Formation as it did its best
to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The first strike
of the semi-translucent golden sword nearly destabilized the Ragnarok
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stab! The Triult Sword
Formation launched yet another attack, this one using the ‘Blood
Drop Stance’ of the [Brightmoon] sword-art and striking with
extraordinary speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Ragnarok
Formation completely blew apart. Sword-ki sliced everywhere, causing
the majority of the True Immortals in the formation to be reduced to
dust. The six Daofathers and the remainder of the True Immortals
sought to flee, but the semi-translucent golden sword then spun
about, transforming into an enormous black hole that drew in and
ground to death all of the Immortals and Fiendgods in the area. Some
attempted to hide in their Immortal estates, but even those estates
were ground to tiny pieces. Of the thousands of Immortals, only eight
were able to survive, all of which were only able to do so because
they had extraordinarily powerful estate-worlds or Immortal estates
on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the eight were
Daofathers while five were True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” The
black-robed Ning flew over towards them, waving his hand and
collecting all eight of those treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ashes to ashes…dust
to dust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha, in command of a Pangu Genesis Formation, also advanced
through the Void as he charged towards the Seamless Gate’s army.
The mighty formations of the Seamless Gate quickly began to flee.
Although these formations had many Immortals and Fiendgods inside of
them, how could they possibly fight Lord Buddha head-on? A Ragnarok
Formation had been destroyed by Ji Ning with just two blows!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall BREAK!!!!”
A furious roared echoed throughout the entire Three Realms, causing
the infinite Void to shudder and shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RIIIIIIIIIP!!!!!!!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blinding golden light
suddenly appeared at the end of the distant Void. It was like a giant
golden tear in the emptiness of space. Although the Nuwa Alliance and
the Seamless Gate were in the middle of a giant battle, they couldn’t
help but pay attention to what had just happened. The rift of golden
light was at least a hundred million kilometers long, and it seemed
to very nearly tear apart the entire Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep inside the rift of
golden light, something which looked like a massive, turbid flood
could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The torrential flood of
water gushed out from the golden rift, quickly passing through into
the Void and flowing towards the battlefield where the Nuwa Alliance
and the Seamless Gate were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the waters finished
flowing out the distant golden rift quickly healed and closed,
completely disappearing from sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonheart.” The
Lord of All Fiends was the first to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha….ahahahahaha!
I’ve finally returned…I’VE FINALLY RETURNED! AHAHAHA!” Wild,
frenzied laughter rang out, echoing throughout the Void. The raging
waters of the river quickly solidified into a tall, slender,
black-robed figure. He had thick, bushy, ink-black eyebrows, and a
pair of intoxicating eyes that caused those who looked into it to
feel an uncontrollable urge to submit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His black robes rustled
about him as his aura surged towards the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tathagata.” The
black-robed figure waved his hand, causing his palm to once more
transform into a raging river that smashed directly towards Lord
Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha, who had
been charging towards the Seamless Gate’s army, was forced to turn
his attention towards this oncoming palm attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Pangu
Genesis Formation shuddered violently, causing Tathagata’s face to
change. The raging river then delivered a second blow with incredible
speed, so fast that no one present was able to block it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The Pangu Genesis
Formation actually broke apart. Lord Buddha was knocked flying
backwards, and as he did so he frantically waved his hand to use his
[Buddha-Realm Within the Palm] to collect as many Empyrean Gods as he
could. However, more than 90% of the Empyrean Gods were instantly
reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
black-robed figure assaulted Tathagata, Ji Ning immediately used his
Triult Sword Formation to counterattack, sending the awesome power of
the semi-translucent golden sword forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed figure
delivered yet another blow of his palm. His palm once more
transformed into a raging river, striking against the tip of that
semi-translucent golden sword. The sword let out a keening cry as the
raging river shuddered and dissipated slightly. However, the sword
itself was knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
turned completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The army of the Nuwa
Alliance had been in hot pursuit, but now they quickly began to
regroup. Ning’s true body and Primaltwin moved towards each other,
while Lord Buddha flew back to his side as well. Everyone stared at
that black-robed figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After appearing, he had
attacked twice with his palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With one palm attack,
he had effortlessly suppressed the Triult Sword Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the other palm
attack, he had delivered a double-blow that had annihilated a Pangu
Genesis Formation that had been commanded by Lord Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand army of the
Seamless Gate quickly reassembled as well. Even Godfiend Witherspike,
Saber, and the others retreated temporarily. As he retreated,
Godfiend Witherspike stared fixedly at the skinny, black-robed figure
as he chatted mentally with Saber. “So he is the Lord of the
Demonheart? He’s too powerful. Even in the endless primordial
chaos, he would be one of the most supreme of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals. He’s incredibly close to the World God level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. He’s
definitely a transcendent figure amongst Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals.” Saber’s heart was quivering as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Elder Gods had
the power of an ordinary ‘overlord’; this was the power which
Elder Gods were born possessing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elite Elder Gods
included the likes of Ji Ning and Keeper Everwood. When Daoist Three
Purities and the others used certain formations, they could also
attain this level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos, most Elder Gods and first-tier Ancestral Immortals
who did some adventuring and who worked hard would generally be able
to reach the ‘elite’ level of power. However, less than one in a
thousand Elder Gods would be able to reach such a supreme level of
power, a level of power that was extremely close to that of a World
God or a Chaos Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone. He is the Lord of the Demonheart,” Daoist Three Purities
sent mentally. “Long ago, he merged his body into the Heavenly
Daos. I never would’ve imagined that he would actually be able to
escape from them.” Everyone who saw this scene could guess that it
was most likely Lord Demonheart who had just broken free of the
Heavenly Daos. If he hadn’t, how could he possibly have struck out
at them and slain so many Empyrean Gods?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually broke
free.” Ning felt dread as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was too
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Triult Sword
Formation was his most powerful technique…but it had actually been
crushed in a head-on clash. This ‘Lord of the Demonheart’ was far
too strong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the war that had
ended the Primordial Era, the most powerful combatant of the Pangu
Chaosworld had been Mother Nuwa, while the most powerful combatant of
the Seamless Chaosworld had been Lord Demonheart! The two had been on
the exact same level. Mother Nuwa had become a World God and left the
Three Realms, while Lord Demonheart had merged himself into the
Heavenly Daos and remained within them for countless years. But
today…he had broken free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonheart.” The
two bodies of the Lord of All Fiends merged together once more, and
he stared calmly at the Lord of the Demonheart. “You owe me an
explanation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An explanation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart’s
black robes rustled, causing space around him to ripple like water.
He chuckled. “Yes, I do owe you an explanation. You really are
quite clever, Windfiend. Even all those years ago, I could tell that
although Everwood’s reputation was second only to mine in the
Seamless Chaosworld, only you were truly a match for me. I have to
thank you for what you did during the clash between our two
chaosworlds. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be able to see my
disciple and grand-disciples today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The explanation.”
The Lord of All Fiends continued to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Lord
Demonheart laughed. “Your guess is correct. I was indeed the one
behind all of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart turned
his hypnotic gaze towards the Nuwa Alliance, his voice reverberating
within the Void. “It was all because of me. I wished to break free
of the Three Realms, which is why I had to come up with a way to
cause this great war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What does you
breaking free have to do with this great war?” The Lord of All
Fiends frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…I’ll
tell you, all of you. Especially you.” Lord Demonheart once more
swept his gaze towards the Nuwa Alliance. “Before you die, I’ll
let you know why exactly you are dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance were all filled with murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ‘Lord of the
Demonheart’ was behaving far too arrogantly. He actually held them
in no regard at all! Still, Ning and the others all understood that
although Lord Demonheart wouldn’t be able to effortlessly dominate
them as a World God would, the power Lord Demonheart had displayed
just now meant that multiple overlords of the Nuwa Alliance would
most likely have to join forces against him in order to stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, your true
body, Jueming, and myself will join forces and strike out
simultaneously against Lord Demonheart,” Suiren sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
Buddha Jueming both assented.
</P>

Chapter 21 - The Lord of the Demonheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s true body
was as tough as a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure. Buddha
Jueming had mastered the [Nine Elements Annihilation], coming up with
his own palm-arts that were even more formidable than those of Lord
Tathagata’s. Not only were his palms comparable to top-grade
Protocosmic spirit-treasures, so was the rest of his body! As for
Suiren…his attainments in fire were simply too profound. He had
long ago mastered his own flameform incarnation technique, which was
similar to how Lord Demonheart could transform his body into the
waters of a raging river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Ji Ning,
Jueming, and Suiren would dare to fight head-on against Lord
Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart,
however, held the Nuwa Alliance in no regard whatsoever. He sighed
wistfully, “When Nuwa suddenly broke through to become a World God,
she came straight for me. I was out of options. I could sense that
the Heavenly Daos of the newly forming Three Realms contained a
demonheart within it, and so I immediately merged myself into those
Heavenly Daos, avoiding that near disaster. If Nuwa wanted to kill
me, she would’ve had to destroy the entire Three Realms. Clearly,
she wasn’t willing to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I managed
to survive, I was perpetually trapped inside of the Heavenly Daos,
becoming part of them. Even I myself thought that I would forever be
a part of the Heavenly Daos, and that I would perish with the Three
Realms when it eventually perished, as all chaosworlds do. But I
wasn’t willing to accept that…and so all this time I’ve been
searching for a chance to escape the Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart once
more turned his gaze towards the Nuwa Alliance. “The Heavenly Daos
that apply to the Three Realms were formed from multiple Daos,
including metal, wood, water, fire, earth, Yin, Yang, life,
destruction, chaos, the sword, the Taiji, infinity, thunder,
demonheart, and more. These countless Daos joined together to form
the complete set of functioning Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later…I realized
that the Heavenly Daos weren’t always completely stable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example, when
many worlds began to clear their forests, the causing the amount of
wood in the Three Realms to slowly lessen, the Heavenly Dao of Wood
would slowly begin to weaken as well.” Lord Demonheart smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, the
distant Ji Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The records which World
God Northrest had transmitted to Ning had made it clear to him that
there were differences amongst chaosworlds. In some chaosworlds, for
example, there was an enormous amount of fire; those places were
known as ‘flame chaosworlds’. The most powerful Dao in a flame
chaosworld would be the Heavenly Dao of Fire, and in that chaosworld
it was entirely possible that it would be nearly as complete as the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword
also had at least six levels and was thus also comparable to the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Dao of Wood
and the Dao of Fire could also be continuously developed to the point
where it would be a match for the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flame chaosworld
could, over the course of its development, suffer from special
circumstances that would cause the entire chaosworld to all but be
destroyed. This would instill the entire chaosworld with the aura of
destruction, very possibly causing it to transform into a destruction
chaosworld. As for the formerly supreme Heavenly Dao of Fire, it
would dramatically weaken, allowing the Heavenly Dao of Destruction
to become the most important Heavenly Dao in that chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are
fluctuations in every single Heavenly Dao.” Lord Demonheart smiled.
“When the Three Realms sink into times of strife, resulting in many
deaths and killings, the devil in the heart of all creatures will
grow stronger. As a result, the entire Dao of the Demonheart will
grow stronger and stronger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I realized that as
the Dao of the Demonheart grew stronger, my influence over the Three
Realms grew greater as well. In fact, I had the feeling that if the
Dao of the Demonheart grew strong enough, I would be able to break
free from the Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms. And if the Dao of
the Demonheart became the most powerful Dao of the Three Realms? Then
I would become the absolute master of the Three Realms. My will would
be the will of the Three Realms itself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the Three
Realms is merely a single chaosworld. How could I let myself be
perpetually tied down to a single chaosworld? All I needed was to
make the Dao of the Demonheart strong enough that I could escape the
Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…the Heavenly
Daos functioned in a way in which the balance is automatically
maintained. I had no chance of changing things at all…until one
day, my chance came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart said
smugly, “After countless years of propagation, the number of living
creatures in the Three Realms grew to an unfathomable level. More and
more Immortal cultivators and Diremonsters emerged. More and more
Celestial Immortals, Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals were born. In
fact, even many Daofathers were born as well. This placed an
increasingly greater burden on the Three Realms. All of you refused
to engage in civil war, which meant that more and more experts
continued to arise with very few perishing. The burden on the Three
Realms grew to be so great that I could sense that one day, it could
cause the Three Realms to collapse and be destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Everyone
present was astonished. Too many living creatures could cause the
destruction of the Three Realms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you
understand? Imagine being on a boat that can seat twenty. If two
hundred of you board the boat, the boat will sink! The same is true
for the Three Realms. It is nothing more than a single chaosworld!
You can see for yourselves how many major powers, Immortals, and
Fiendgods existed within the Nuwa Alliance and my Seamless Gate. The
number of Celestial Immortals was truly inestimable!” Lord
Demonheart laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the Nuwa Alliance
and the Seamless Gate had to admit this was true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, they had
all been sighing emotionally at how this war was far greater in scale
than the one which had destroyed the Primordial Era. And yet, the
experts who took part in the war that ended the Primordial Era had
come from two different chaosworlds, while this time they came from
just one; the Three Realms. This single chaosworld of the Three
Realms had more experts than those two chaosworlds combined!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though the Three
Realms was a special chaosworld that had been born from the collision
of two different chaosworlds, it apparently had still been under
enormous pressure due to the number of creatures who were living
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly Daos of
the Three Realms were intrinsically searching for a solution to lower
the number of living creatures in the Three Realms. They sent down
countless disasters and tribulations, but it was all useless.
Immortals and Fiendgods are simply too good at staying alive. The
calamities the Heavenly Daos sent down were only capable of killing
ordinary mortals, and even then Immortals and Fiendgods would
sometimes set up large formations to protect those mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mortals continued to
propagate, filling every world of the Three Realms. Countless
Immortals and Diremonsters continued their path of cultivation,
resulting in more and more powerful experts. If this continued
unabated, the entirety of the Three Realms would be completely
crushed and shattered by the burden.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s when I knew
that my chance had come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I communed with the
Three Realms, imparting unto it the suggestion to have the Nuwa
Alliance and the Seamless Gate engage in a great battle. My idea was
to have the two sides engage in a great civil war; without a doubt,
enormous amounts of Immortals and Fiendgods would die during this
war. This would instantly cause the burden on the Three Realms to be
dramatically lessened.” Lord Demonheart laughed. “And it would be
quite easy for us to instigate this war. All we had to do was to have
fate whisper to both sides and guide them, telling them that only one
of the two sides could survive. If one side wished to survive, they
would have to annihilate the other side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The living creatures
of the Three Realms would never question it when fate itself
whispered to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…but the
River of Destiny of the Three Realms is nothing more than part of the
Heavenly Daos that function to maintain the Three Realms.” Lord
Demonheart roared with laughter. “In the past, the Heavenly Daos of
the Three Realms had functioned in an extremely fair and just manner.
However, after the Heavenly Daos realized that the propagation of the
various living races was threatening the very survival of the Three
Realms, it automatically began to adjust itself in a way that would
ensure more internal warfare amongst the various races. All I did was
give it a little push.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance and
the Seamless Gate all had ashen looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all a scheme? It
was the Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms which had guided them to
kill each other?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I nudged the
Seamless Gate into causing all sorts of trouble, filling the Three
Realms with all sorts of chaos and slaughter. Shadows were cast over
the hearts of countless living creatures, giving birth to the
demonheart within their soul.” Lord Demonheart laughed. “I even
had the Seamless Gate launch large-scale assassinations of the family
members and loved ones of the Nuwa Alliance, causing the demonheart
to fester and growth within the hearts of many of your experts. Some
of them actually died when their demonhearts grew out of control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
were thrown into chaos, and the demonheart prospered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Demonheart continued to grow increasingly powerful. Although I could
sense that much chances were growing greater and greater, I continued
to wait. I knew that I could only make one attempt to break free of
the Three Realms. If I failed, the Heavenly Daos would use all sorts
of schemes and ploys to more firmly entrap me and suppress me. It
would be very hard for me to find a second such chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After a thousand
years of chaos in the Three Realms, the Dao of the Demonheart had
become very powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally…you
started the wars.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fine
slaughter it was! Immortals and Fiendgods died in droves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were filled with
hatred and the desire to kill. You hated your enemies to the bone,
but you had no idea that as your hatred filled the heavens, the
demonheart grew within the Three Realms and within you. The Dao of
the Demonheart only grew even more powerful.” Lord Demonheart
smiled. “Nuwa left behind those three guardian formations, and I
imagine she also left behind a technique allowing one to train to
become an Elder God. Quite a few of you ended up becoming Elder Gods,
and you also had such powerful formations…the Endwar has just
started, but the Seamless Gate has already begun to crumble. That’s
why I decided to immediately break free of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…I’ve been
scheming and preparing for countless years for this moment. I was at
a higher level of enlightenment than I was during the war that ended
the Primordial Era. When I suddenly struck out, I was able to break
free of the Three Realms in one blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
I shall forever be free and unrestrained, bound by no one and
nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheat laughed
heartily, his laughter reverberating throughout the endless Void.
Everyone present, be it the Nuwa Alliance or the Seamless Gate, could
sense the wild, exultant joy which the Lord of the Demonheart felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been imprisoned
for countless years and had schemed for countless years to escape,
knowing that there would only be one chance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And he had succeeded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why shouldn’t he be
excited?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the story has
been made clear to all of you…” Lord Demonheart swept the army of
the Nuwa Alliance with his gaze. “All of you can die now.”

Chapter 22 - Surrounded and Attacked
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and Saber were standing at the margins of the battlefield. The Nuwa
Alliance had yet to actually begin to fight against the Seamless Gate
once more, but the two exchanged a glance and instantly hid
themselves within their dark-gold castle. With a swoosh, they flew
far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protected within the
castle, Godfiend Witherspike, Saber, and the retainers were now quite
relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect a
local chaosworld to produce a truly supreme Elder God.” Godfiend
Witherspike let out a chortling sigh. “This supreme Elder God would
be considered an expert, even in the endless primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Elder Gods
were the weakest type of Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elite Elder Gods were
talented, powerful Elder Gods who had fairly powerful divine
abilities and fairly deep insights into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supreme Elder Gods,
however, were very close to World Gods in power. They were considered
true experts, and they were generally able to do quite well for
themselves within the endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, the Three
Realms didn’t have Elder Gods of this caliber. An Elder God of this
caliber would only appear when there was a confluence of monstrous
talent, incredible luck, superb divine abilities and techniques,
exceptional treasures, and many other factors. Only then would such a
supreme Elder God emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and Saber had retreated. Both armies were like arrows nocked to
bowstrings, ready to shoot forward at a moment’s notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji NIng, Jueming,
let’s do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren, Buddha Jueming,
and Ji Ning simultaneously charged forward towards Lord Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me be the one to
accompany the two of you.” The Lord of All Fiends’ body blurred,
once more splitting into two as he went to block the black-robed Ning
and Lord Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he hadn’t
been able to stop the black-robed Ning, Ning had already slaughtered
many people earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata had
reformed a new Pangu Genesis Formation. For now, there was no else
one available to stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Lord Allfiends
began to battle against the black-robed Ning and Lord Buddha. The
Lord of All Fiends was simply too fast, even faster than Ning’s
Triult Sword Formation. This allowed him to completely tie down both
Ning and Lord Buddha for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood, I have all
the Immortal pills I need. Let’s see how long your divine power can
hold out for.” Daoist Three Purities and his formation began to
battle against Keeper Everwood once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
was using up Immortal energy, while Keeper Everwood was using up
divine power. There was no real way to replenish divine power.
Strictly speaking, there were a few unique treasures that could
replenish it, such as chaos nectar, but these treasures were
incredibly rare. An entire bottle of chaos nectar would only be
enough to repair the bodies of ten or twenty Celestial Immortals; it
wouldn’t even be enough to heal the body of a True Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To heal the body of an
Elder God, not even a hundred bottles of chaos nectar would be
enough. Obviously, no one in the Three Realms had that much chaos
nectar. Even in the endless primordial chaos, there was no one who
would waste that much chaos nectar just to replenish their divine
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
me, my divine power can sustain me for quite a long period of time.
Demonheart is now much more powerful than before. Your side will
collapse long before I do,” Keeper Everwood said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two former
friends were now fighting for their lives against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew that this
had been caused by Lord Demonheart, but it was as though they were
riding on the back of a tiger; there was no way off the ride. The
hatred between the Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance was now
bone-deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Yuan!”
Gonggong roared furiously, but the only response that came were those
countless strings from Old Man Yuan’s horsetail whisk which
completely blocked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s
defensive skills were simply too formidable. Gonggong was completely
stymied for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Shennong commanded his Pangu Genesis Formation to do battle against
Daofather Ink Bamboo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Bloodswan’s
true body and Primaltwin both flew towards the Seamless Gate’s
army, assisting them in battling against the Nuwa Alliance’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, there was
only a single overlord on the battlefield who was free…Houyi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi had been battling
against the alien Outsider, Godfiend Witherspike. However, now that
Witherspike and Saber had retreated, Houyi was free to make one of
two choices. He could either assist his army to battle against the
Seamless Gate army, or he could get involved in the battle between
the elites.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi knew that right
now, the critical part of this battle lay in defeating the Lord of
the Demonheart. By contrast, the battle between the two great armies
wasn’t as important. Although the Seamless Gate’s army had the
assistance of Daofather Bloodswan, their own side had the help of
Fuxi, whose Waterflame Apocalypse Formation had taken complete
control over the battlefield. Even with Bloodswan’s assistance, the
Seamless Gate’s army was still at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonheart.” Houyi
focused his attention on the Lord of the Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demonheart, prepare
to die.” Ning was in his three-headed, six-armed form as he struck
out with his six swords in close combat, his sword-arts absolutely
shocking to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amitabha.” Buddha
Jueming stood far off in the distance, sending one giant golden palm
after another towards Lord Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Suiren, he swept
out with his wooden staff, transforming it into a river of flames as
he struck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…is that all
you have? And you want to try to stop me?!” The newly unleashed
Lord Demonheart was itching for a fight. As Ji Ning, Jueming, and
Suiren assaulted him, his own body blurred as he also manifested
three heads and six arms. However, his six arms then quickly
transformed into six raging rivers of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! As the raging
rivers crashed into him, Ning was still knocked flying away despite
doing his best to resist it. This was an overwhelming disparity in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Buddha Jueming
was also knocked flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Suiren was sent
stumbling backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of them had
powerful protective divine abilities and thus were uninjured.
However, Lord Demonheart had manifested a total of six arms, but only
used three of them against them just now! He was able to completely
crush them with three arms…which was to say that he had the power
to suppress six elite overlords like Ji Ning, who only had a chance
because he had a strong enough divine body to just barely resist
those attacks. The Lord of the Demonheart clearly was a supreme Elder
God, but the Nuwa Alliance didn’t have anyone on that same level of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As those three raging
rivers continued to crash down upon them, Lord Demonheart suddenly
sent the other three rivers to all surge towards Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, Suiren.” Lord
Demonheart’s cold voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Jueming
both had bodies comparable to top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures;
killing them would be difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren had a body that
could transform into flames. Although he would also be hard to kill,
it would be a bit easier to kill him than Ji Ning or Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Lord
Demonheart suddenly felt an inexplicable tendril of fear. He
hurriedly turned his head to look, and as he did he immediately saw
Houyi standing far off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was staring at
him coldly. He was holding an ancient divine bow in one hand and
gripping a black arrow in the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi?” Lord
Demonheart actually smirked, his laughter once more thundering
through the Void. “Houyi. Ahahaha! I fear archery the least of all.
Come, come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was calm and
silent as he slowly nocked his arrow and drew back the bowstring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shudder…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi drew the bow to
full draw, the tip of his arrow pointed directly towards the Lord of
the Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
suddenly was thrown into a strange, hushed silence. All of the
Immortals and Fiendgods present could sense an invisible form of
pressure that weighed down upon their very souls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?” The
faces of the distant Godfiend Witherspike and Saber changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
type of archery.” Godfiend Witherspike muttered to himself, “This
Houyi…he truly is formidable. This local chaosworld is far too
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is
impressive.” Saber felt the pressure as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Gonggong and Old
Man Yuan paused mid-battle, turning their heads to look towards
Houyi. The two of them had also reached the fifth stage of
heartforce, and they could sense that Houyi was only at the fifth
stage as well. However, in the instant that Houyi drew his bow, the
invisible pressure that manifested caused even them to feel their
spirits being crushed. This was an absolutely terrifying archery
skill that involved completely and perfectly joining heartforce,
divine power, and the soul together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This arrow will be
far more terrifying than the one he used to kill that Golden Crow
‘Emperor of Monsters’ all those years ago.” Fuxi was also
watching this battle, and he couldn’t help but sigh in amazement to
himself by what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This arrow…”
Ning felt his own heart quiver as well. Although the arrow wasn’t
targeting him, he felt a white rabbit who had suddenly run into a
sleeping tiger. The tiger was slumbering, but the rabbit would still
feel its heart shudder in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This arrow…”
Even Lord Allfiend’s face changed. During the war that ended the
Primordial Era, he hadn’t held Houyi in any regard. Houyi’s
arrows weren’t able to catch up to him, after all. But now…faced
with this arrow…the Lord of All Fiends could sense that even he
wouldn’t be able to escape it. He would have to block the arrow
first, then flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present could
sense the terrifying threat which Houyi’s arrow posed. Even the
most powerful figure present, Lord Demonheart, felt his heart quiver
slightly. However, he still felt absolute confidence in himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Lord
Demonheart continued to strike towards Suiren with four of his arms,
each of which had been transformed into a raging river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A light twang of the
bowstring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An arrow instantly
pierced through the Void. It originally was completely silent, but as
it pierced through the Void it immediately began to ravenously devour
all energy around it. Elemental energy, natural energy, chaos
energy…it ravenously devoured everything, and as it did it howled
as it tore through the emptiness of the Void. Quickly, the aura of
light around the arrow became thirty thousand meters long…three
million meters long…three million kilometers long…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an enormous
rainbow that was streaking through the Void. All the major powers
pressure felt a sense of tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” Lord
Demonheart just laughed wildly, continuing his assaults against
Suiren. Bombarded by those four rivers, Suiren’s flames were being
rapidly depleted and consumed. When all his flames were used up, he
would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gigantic
arrow-rainbow finally reached Lord Demonheart. This arrow was far too
fast for Lord Demonheart to dodge, and he felt dodging to be beneath
himself anyways. His gaze finally turned towards that arrow-rainbow.
As far as he was concerned, the unearthly power of the rainbow light
surrounding the arrow was all meaningless; the only real threat was
the seemingly ordinary black arrow itself.

Chapter 23 - Inconsolable
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart could
still feel a tinge of fear in his heart, and he didn’t dare to be
the slightest bit overconfident in facing this attack. Although he
acted with bravado, when the arrow actually shot out towards him he
acted with great caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Lord
Demonheart let out a cold snort, his entire body beginning to
transform into an endless flood of water. It was as though his body
was made of countless drops of water to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow pierced
straight towards Lord Demonheart. Lord Demonheart didn’t try to
block at all, allowing the arrow to pierce straight though his body.
The water rippled around the arrow, which easily pierced through it
then exited from Lord Demonheart’s back and continued to fly far
off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you try to cut water
with a knife, the water will continue to flow. When the arrow passed
through the water, it left behind no traces of its passing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hissssss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart’s
face suddenly turned ashen as he revealed an expression of utter
terror. A hole had appeared in his chest where the arrow had passed
through, and that hole was rapidly corroding and rotting away at the
rest of his body, causing those drops of water to vaporize and
vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.
Impossible!” Lord Demonheart had a look of horror on his face. “My
riverform has been perfected. I have a deathless body. This is
impossible. It’s impossible to injure me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate began to panic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Nuwa Alliance,
Ji Ning, Daoist Three Purities, and the other major powers all
revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, none of them
understood what was happening. Not even Ji Ning understood. World God
Northrest had transmitted certain information to him, but there was
still much that he did not know.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…Godslayer?”
Godfiend Witherspike and Saber were watching from far away, and Saber
began mumbling to himself. “Godslayer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?
Godslayer?” Godfiend Witherspike was surprised. He immediately sent
mentally, “What’s a Godslayer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godslayer is a type
of special attacking technique which only those mysterious Heartforce
Cultivators are capable of using.” The one-armed Saber sent
mentally, “The are able to merge their heartforce with their divine
power, then use it to attack. They will use their own divine power to
wipe out the opponent’s divine power. It’s like a mutual
exhaustion of divine power. The Heartforce Cultivator will exhaust
his own divine power to ensure that the enemy will exhaust even more
divine power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is like a
strategy of sacrificing eight hundred of your men to slay a thousand
enemies. Despite that, it’s a terrifying ability,” the one-armed
Saber sent mentally. “Once a Heartforce Cultivator begins to use
this technique, he will be virtually invincible against other Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals. However, while he might be able to slay
his foes he will also badly injure himself, making it so that he’ll
no longer be able to fight. Generally speaking, Heartforce
Cultivators aren’t willing to use this ability unless they are in
truly desperate straits. In addition, even amongst Heartforce
Cultivators, this technique can be considered a fairly rare one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Godfiend
Witherspike was quite surprised. Although he had gone adventuring as
well, he had mostly adventured through regions that he was fairly
familiar with. Saber, in truth, was an even bolder and more fearless
person than him. Saber had gone to more danger zones and had learned
many more things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Lord of the
Demonheart is about to die.” Saber stared at the distant, horrified
Lord Demonheart. “He actually ran into such a terrifyingly powerful
Heartforce Cultivator…and this Heartforce Cultivator is willing to
sacrifice anything in order to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If what you say is
true, then after Houyi kills Lord Demonheart he’ll probably be at
the verge of death himself.” Godfiend Witherspike revealed a smile.
“That means we still have a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Houyi must have
acquired the legacy of a Heartforce Cultivator.” Saber stared at
the distant Houyi. “I absolutely refuse to believe that he could
come up with this technique on his own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were tens of
millions of heartforce application techniques. Some cultivators with
fifth-stage heartforce were of average strength, but some true
Heartforce Cultivators had techniques which were powerful enough to
make all Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals quail in fear! Houyi’s
‘Godslayer’ technique was one such technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this technique
really does work on you.” Upon seeing Lord Demonheart suffer an
injury, the murderous intent in Houyi’s eyes grew even stronger. “I
was worried that you might be so powerful as to completely ignore my
arrows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi swiftly nocked an
arrow, drew to a full draw, then fired the arrow in one swift motion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black arrow
streaked forward like lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang! Not hesitating
at all, Houyi took out yet another arrow, nocked it, drew it, and
fired it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One arrow after another
streaked through the Void, transforming into a series of blindingly
brilliant rainbows that shot straight towards Lord Demonheart. This
was a strange, unique secret art which he had devised over the course
of countless years of tree-chopping on Mount Innerheart. Upon
actually using the technique, he would use up an utterly enormous
amount of divine power, but he didn’t care at all, continuing to
furiously shoot out arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He shot out nine
consecutive arrows in one breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those nine arrows all
transformed into rainbows as they streaked through the Void, shooting
straight towards Lord Demonheart. Despite being tremendously
powerful, Houyi was only able to simultaneously control nine arrows
at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…no…” The
Lord of the Demonheart stared in horror as the arrows shot towards
him from across the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single arrow had
already injured him badly. How could he possibly survive if all nine
of these arrows connected?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrows were too
fast. Not even the Lord of All Fiends was as fast as these arrows,
much less the Lord of the Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t die. I
won’t!” A berserk look appeared in Lord Demonheart’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart’s
body suddenly split apart in half, resulting in more than a hundred
of him appearing and fleeing in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! One rainbow arrow
pierced directly into the body of a Lord Demonheart. After piercing
into his body, its power was slightly weakened, but it was still
powerful enough to go straight through it and shoot towards the other
Lord Demonhearts. As for the first one to be struck, his body was
instantly annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine rainbows
continued to streak through the air at high speed, shooting towards
the various Lord Demonhearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless.”
The distant Saber shook his head. “Every single arrow is filled
with an enormous amount of Houyi’s divine power. Until his divine
power is exhausted, the arrow won’t come to a halt. That’s why
splitting up your body into multiple clones is a completely
ineffective way to avoid this terrifying attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could an attack
known as the ‘Godslayer’ be easily overcome? If it could, it
wouldn’t be so famously deadly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart also
quickly came to realize that this ‘solution’ wouldn’t work. He
quickly willed his still-existing 106 bodies to roar in unison as
they transformed into a raging river of vast proportions. The vast
river transformed into a giant palm of water that struck directly at
one of the arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A frontal collision!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow was knocked
flying, but the bizarre divine power which had been infused into it
still instantly ate away at the gigantic palm of water, depleting an
enormous amount of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodging doesn’t
work. Neither does blocking. What should I do!?” Lord Demonheart
let out another sudden howl, causing the vast river to suddenly tear
an enormous rift into the Void before him. The river quickly shrank
in size as it flew straight towards that enormous rift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow chased after
him, making it to the rift right after he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The Void was once
more torn open. The raging river was blasted out from the other side
through the new rift, reforming into the Lord of the Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!
I don’t accept this! I can’t accept this! I WON’T ACCEPT THIS!
GRAAAAAAH!!!” Lord Demonheart had gone completely berserk. As he
stared the arrows streaking towards him from afar, the sense of
absolute despair he felt began to drive him insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had waited for so
long! Had schemed and planned for so long to regain his freedom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…he had
succeeded in escaping the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had thought that he
would be able to easily subjugate the Nuwa Alliance. He was planning
to leave the Three Realms to the major powers of the Seamless Gate,
then lead a small group of people to voyage out into the vaster world
outside of the Three Realms. He believed that the vast primordial
chaos was where he truly belonged! Even Nuwa had become a World God;
Lord Demonheart felt certain that he could become a World God as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart had
many plans for the future, many ambitions, many dreams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those arrows were
utterly terrifying, and there was no way to block them at all. He
felt true despair as he stared at them come towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really can’t
accept this. I really can’t.” Lord Demonheart’s mutters echoed
throughout the vast Void. “Well…if I’m going to die…then
let’s have everyone die. All of you shall die as well!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart
instantly transformed his body into a series of raging rivers once
more. Every single one of the six rivers flashed with white light as
they surged violently towards the Nuwa Alliance. By now, he didn’t
care about Houyi’s arrows at all. The only thing he wanted to do
was kill. If he was going to die, then all of them were going to die
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
could only watch as this happened, powerless to stop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was many millions of
kilometers away from Houyi. Although he was faster than the speed of
light, which could move three hundred thousand kilometers in a
second, he himself could only move five hundred thousand kilometers
per second! Houyi was more than capable of maintaining his distance
as he continued to fire off arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the power in each
arrow was depleted, Houyi would continue to shoot out new arrows,
intending to slay the Lord of the Demonheart as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold for just a bit
longer. This is Lord Demonheart’s final, desperate attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Buddha
Jueming had powerful divine bodies, and so the two of them valiantly
charged to the forefront, seeking to block this last-ditch attack.
However, two of the six raging rivers were enough to completely tie
them down. In fact, Ning could sense that Lord Demonheart’s attack
seemed to be a bit stronger than it was earlier. He understood that
in his berserk madness, Lord Demonheart had certainly drawn upon
every single scrap of power he possessed to deliver this final
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suiren!” Ning
suddenly realized that the distant Suiren was in extremely dire
straits, having been completely surrounded by two of those rivers.
Suiren was roaring with rage, his body blazing with flames as he
swung his wooden staff around to defend. His aura initially towered
to the heavens, but as the raging rivers continued to surround and
suffocate him his aura slowly and gradually began to weaken.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect Suiren.”
Daoist Three Purities frantically exerted the power of his Immortal
Slaying Swords. He was fairly far away from Keeper Everwood, and so
he could afford to take a moment’s respite and temporarily ignore
his opponent. A dazzling, freezing sword pierced out through the
Void, stabbing directly at the flood of water surrounding Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A raging river of water
immediately turned to smash head-on against the Immortal Slaying
Swords. The sword-light shattered and the Immortal Slaying Swords
were knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rescue Suiren.” Ji
Ning and Buddha Jueming strove to intercept the attacks, but the
raging rivers swirling around them had completely tied them down,
giving then no way to advance at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about leaving.” The Lord of All Fiends easily blocked the
black-robed Ning and Lord Tathagata from moving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the major powers
of the Nuwa Alliance wished to save Suiren, but none of them were
able to draw close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong, be
careful!” Fuxi called out furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raging waters once
more came crashing against Suiren.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that of the six rivers of water which the Lord of the Demonheart had
manifested, two were being used to die down Ning and Buddha Jueming,
two were being used to kill Suiren, and the final two were striking
out against various other individuals. Shennong was in command of a
Pangu Genesis Formation and was using it to fight in close combat,
which was why he had charged the farthest and was the closest to Lord
Demonheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The water came crashing
towards Shennong. Shennong sought to evade, but the endlessly growing
bamboo stopped him at every turn. Soon, the raging river had
completely enveloped Shennong as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! As
the waters of the river crashed against Shennong, his Pangu Genesis
Formation began to shudder and shake. It was at the verge of breaking
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of every
member of the Nuwa Alliance changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren was an Elder
God, and his body could be dematerialized into endless flames. As a
result, he was able to resist Lord Demonheart’s attacks for quite
some time. Although the situation looked dangerous, he would still be
able to hold for a bit longer. Shennong, however, was somewhat
weaker. His Pangu Genesis Formation most likely wouldn’t be able to
survive Lord Demonheart’s assaults for very long before being
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Purities,
Fuxi, protect the Three Realms.” Suiren’s voice suddenly echoed
through the Void…and then, his voice became incredibly calm and
peaceful. “Kindle the fire and make it eternal…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his voice was
peaceful, it brought terror to the hearts of those who heard it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren’s body had
been covered with flames that were weak but still seemed capable of
fighting back. Suddenly, the light around him increased dramatically.
Moments later, all of the light around his body solidified into small
flames. Suiren himself completely vanished, leaving behind just those
eight little flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss…crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight flames seemed
tiny and weak, and they rose and fell alongside the river waters that
were surrounding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These bizarre flames
seemed to carry endless life force with them. Although the raging
waters of the rivers around them continued to do their best to
smother these flames, it was the water that ended up hissing and
bubbling as it began to boil away. The two rivers began to quickly
shrink in size, becoming thin and weak. As for those eight little
flames…slowly, they began to be extinguished. One flame. Two flame.
Three flames…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As one river was
completely boiled away and half of the second river was destroyed,
the final few flames were extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren’s aura had
completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suiren…had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! In
the instant that Suiren’s body had dematerialized into those eight
flames, a series of arrows had struck the waters of the rivers as
well. Their primary target was the river which had wrapped itself
around Shennong. As they landed against the river, the river began to
dramatically weaken to the point where it was no longer a threat to
Shennong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrows moved with
incredible speed. Although Lord Demonheart had launched a series of
final, berserk attacks, Suiren’s own final burst of power resulted
in Lord Demonheart’s death being hastened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t accept
this…I can’t accept this…I can’t accept this…” Lord
Demonheart’s furious roars could still be heard echoing within the
waters of the raging rivers. As Houyi continued to fire off arrows,
the river continued to shrink in size and wither away, until finally
it completely disappeared completely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Void was
completely quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance and
the Seamless Gate had both fallen silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone felt dazed and
stunned. This war had been instigated by the Lord of the Demonheart,
and he had done so to escape from the confines of the Heavenly Daos.
As the former king of the Seamless Chaosworld, Lord Demonheart’s
reputation and power was known to everyone on this field of battle.
The Nuwa Alliance had been quite terrified of him, as he truly was
incredibly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had died just like
that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened…” The black-robed Godking stared blankly into the Void.
When he saw his master come out, he had been exceptionally happy.
After all, although he was the nominal leader of the Seamless Gate,
its actual leader was really the Lord of All Fiends! Most of the
older generation of major powers didn’t pay much attention to him,
which was why he was delighted by the thought of being able to
shelter under his master’s auspices once more. But…his master,
the Lord of the Demonheart, had actually died just like that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this destiny?”
The Lord of All Fiends sighed softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Demonheart had
secretly stirred up this entire mess. This had actually enraged the
Lord of All Fiends, as he was a person who hated to fight over power.
However, there was no way out; the relationship between the Seamless
Gate and the Nuwa Alliance was now like the relationship between fire
and water, utterly irreconcilable. His only choice had been to follow
Lord Demonheart in pressing the assault against the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…Demonheart
had died. Truly died. He had survived the battle that ended the
Primordial Era, but this he did not survive this one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, he had been
able to fuse himself into the Heavenly Daos. However, now that he had
broken free from them once, there was no way the Heavenly Daos would
allow him to merge into them again. This was why there was nowhere
for him to run when Houyi’s final arrows had come for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suiren.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance
didn’t celebrate at all. All they felt was grief. When Daoist Three
Purities, Ji Ning, Fuxi, Tathagata, and the others had seen Suiren
transform himself into those eight flames, their hearts had been
plunged into grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother…”
Shennong’s eyes were wet with tears. “Was it worth doing this for
my sake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those six raging rivers
were like Lord Demonheart’s body. The smaller it became, the weaker
he became. Suiren’s final suicide attack had completely burned away
nearly two of the rivers, causing Lord Demonheart’s body to be
dramatically lessened and weakened, buying time for Houyi’s final
arrows to arrive and save Shennong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t blame
yourself too much. Suiren was already in a desperate situation. Even
if he didn’t launch a suicide attack, he still would’ve been
killed by Lord Demonheart.” Daoist Three Purities let out a sigh,
then said consolingly, “He just didn’t wish to see you die
alongside him. Better for one to die than both.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Shennong
nodded slowly, but he couldn’t disguise his grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance all joined together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi.” They all
turned their heads towards Houyi as the latter flew towards them.
Houyi’s face was ashen, but he still looked quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You alright?”
Kuafu, in command of a Pangu Genesis Formation, immediately inquired
after his well-being.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not dead yet.”
Houyi nodded and smiled, quickly flying to the side of Ji Ning and
Buddha Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Houyi.” Ning looked at Houyi. “It was all
thanks to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
Houyi, it would’ve been hard for us to survive this battle.” The
nearby Buddha Jueming let out a sigh. “I really didn’t expect the
cause of this war to be the Lord of the Demonheart. He truly was
quite powerful, even more powerful than he was during the war that
ended the Primordial Era.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
Houyi’s aura was very weak right now. He didn’t fully understand
what each arrow had cost Houyi, but he could sense that the price had
been enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too bad about
Suiren.” Houyi sighed softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He transformed his
body into kindle, using his life to fuel the flames and ensuring that
it would continue unto perpetuity. This…this is the true meaning of
the ‘Eternal Kindlefire’.” Buddha Jueming folded his palms
together into prayer. “Amitabha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Primordial
Era, Suiren had led the puny, weak race of humans to slowly rise to
power. He had watched as countless human heroes had perished for the
sake of their race, and thus he had developed his own ‘Eternal
Kindlefire’ technique. However, the Eternal Kindlefire could only
unleash its most terrible flames when it was truly infused with the
essence of sacrifice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Nuwa
Alliance was filled with grief, they were also filled with confidence
that they had taken control over the battlefield. Old Man Yuan,
Daofather Ink Bamboo, Keeper Everwood, and the others had all
retreated for now. Without the Lord of the Demonheart, the Seamless
Gate no longer felt any confidence in their ability to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Purities.
Tathagata.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two bodies of the
Lord of All Fiends merged into one. He stood there in midair, looking
at them and speaking in a calm voice. “The outcome of this war is
very clear. It was Demonheart who caused this war, all for the sake
of escaping from the Heavenly Daos. In addition, the Heavenly Daos
themselves acted in ways to mislead us and instigate this war,
precisely because there were too many living creatures within the
Three Realms. Many of us have died on both sides, and the burden on
the Three Realms is now much lower. I think we should bring this war
to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring this war to an
end?” Shennong’s face was a mask of grief, but his eyes blazed as
he growled out, “What, the Seamless Gate still intends to live here
within the Three Realms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms is
also the home of the Seamless Gate.” The Lord of All Fiends sighed
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
laughed coldly. “What a joke! You had your chance…and in fact,
the Nuwa Alliance didn’t wish for all of this to come to a war. It
was your side which continuously caused problems, furiously
assaulting us and provoking us. You even went so far as to cause
chaos throughout the Three Realms, assassinating the friends and
family members of our major powers. Do you think we can just wipe out
all these debts at one stroke?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were foolish
enough to let you return once…do you really think we would be
foolish enough to do so again?”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them. Kill them
all. Make sure they will never pose a problem ever again.”
Gonggong’s mental voice was filled with murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who can kill the
Lord of All Fiends?” Tathagata asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tathagata spoke out
again. “Houyi, can you kill the Lord of All Fiends?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I cannot. He’s too
fast. Although my arrow is faster than him, it’s only slightly
faster. I’d probably only be able to hit him with one or two
arrows, by which point he would’ve fled outside the range of my
bow. In addition to that, I badly injured myself dealing when I dealt
with Demonheart. There’s no way I can kill another Elder God,”
Houyi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
sighed secretly. They could all tell that Houyi was very heavily
injured; for him to be able to kill Demonheart was already an
unexpected surprise for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can kill
Allfiend.” Tathagata sent mentally, “If this battle was to
continue…Allfiend is too fast. He’ll probably launch a series of
crazed counterattacks with his speed. We’ll definitely win, but our
losses will be very heavy and he himself will probably be able to
escape in the end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Everyone
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, we
should force them to leave the Three Realms,” Tathagata sent
mentally. “That will lessen our total casualties. If they ever dare
to return, we can fight them then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That works as well.”
Daoist Three Purities nodded in agreement. “Ji Ning, what do you
think?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other major powers
were all waiting for Ji Ning’s input. They knew exactly how deep Ji
Ning’s hatred for the Seamless Gate ran. It could be said that the
Seamless Gate’s torments had accompanied him during his entire
cultivation path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let them leave.
However…they have to hand over their Godking.” Ning gave his
response. He would never be able to forget how the Godking had killed
Yu Wei. No matter what, he would never spare the Godking. In the
earlier battle, he had focused on the big picture and so had not
attacked the Godking, but there was absolutely no chance that he
would let the Godking leave this place alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Many of the
vilest actions that caused chaos throughout the Three Realms were
carried out by the Godking. I agree that we can’t just let him
leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance quickly concluded their discussion, coming to a joint
agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
willing to leave the Three Realms.” The Lord of All Fiends suddenly
spoke out. “Let this battle come to an end now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a stir in the
ranks of the Seamless Gate. Their major powers, Immortals, and
Fiendgods all turned to look at their leaders, their eyes filled with
resentment and an unwillingness to accept this outcome. Many of them
had been born within the Three Realms; they truly did not wish to
leave this place, their home, and venture into the terrifying,
unknown parts of the primordial chaos. If they were Elder Gods, they
would naturally be able to roam the primordial chaos without fear,
but the vast majority of them were far too weak. Even True Gods and
Daofathers would merely be minor figures in the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…they also knew
that if they continued to fight, the only result would be death.
Although leaving the Three Realms would be dangerous, staying behind
would be even more dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to leave,
just like that?” Daoist Three Purities said coldly, “That’d be
nice, wouldn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what do you
want?” The Lord of All Fiends said in a low voice, “Do you wish
to keep fighting?” It would take him time to rescue everyone. The
Seamless Gate had far too many major powers; once the battle began
anew, he would probably only be able to rescue a part of his allies,
with the other part being massacred by the Nuwa Alliance. He
naturally wished to keep as many of them alive as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Allfiend,” Daoist
Three Purities said, “We won’t make things too hard for you. Hand
over your nominal leader, your black-robed Godking, as a sign of your
repentance and desire to make amends. If you do so, we’ll let you
leave the Three Realms, never to return. If you agree…then the war
can stop now. If you do not, then let us keep fighting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
stared at the Nuwa Alliance, and the major powers of the Nuwa
Alliance stared right back at him. The only reason why the Nuwa
Alliance was even entertaining this option was because the Lord of
All Fiends was too hard to kill; thus, their only choice was to force
him to leave instead! If it wasn’t for that, they would definitely
seize this opportunity to completely wipe out the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
then turned his head to stare at the great army behind him. The
black-robed Godking had been feeling many complicated emotions, but
upon hearing Daoist Three Purities’ request his face instantly
turned bloodless and ashen. When the Lord of All Fiends turned his
gaze towards him, he became filled with utter terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendlord!” The
black-robed Godking called out in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clothred.” The
Lord of All Fiends said, “Sacrifice yourself for the sake of the
Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, Fiendlord! You
must not!” The black-robed Godking said frantically, “I’m the
leader of the Seamless Gate. If you sacrifice me…the Seamless Gate
will have no face left whatsoever! Better that we die in battle than
be shamed in such a way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing these
words, the Lord of All Fiends frowned. He said in a cold voice, “You
really are cut from the exact same cloth as your master Demonheart
was.” He snorted coldly then waved his hand, causing an azure rope
to fly out. The azure rope transformed into an azure dragon as it
flew towards the Godking. The terrified Godking sought to flee, but
space around him began to twist and warp. He found himself completely
bound up before he even had a chance to react. How could someone like
him possibly challenge the power of the Lord of All Fiends?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You cannot!
Fiendlord, you cannot! You cannot just hand me over…” The Godking
struggled frantically against his restraints.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate all stared at the black-robed Godking. Although some of
them disliked him, he was still their nominal leader. For them to
sacrifice their leader in such a way…in truth, they felt quite
humiliated. However, they knew that they had lost this war. Even the
Lord of the Demonheart had perished. There was nothing more they
could say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
made a casual tossing gesture, causing the bound Godking to be flunt
towards the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
transformed into a streak of lightning, moving with incredible speed.
When he saw the bound Godking fly through the air towards him, for
some reason…he felt many different emotions in his heart. So many
scenes flashed through his mind. The scene of how he had knelt down
before the Godking to try and save Yu Wei…the scene of how the
Godking had killed her…and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.” Ning
murmured this word softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-you…” The
tied-up Godking stared at Ji Ning in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relax. I won’t let
you die so easily,” the white-robed Ning murmured gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, the
Godking began to panic even more. The outcome he feared the most was
ending up in Ji Ning’s hands. However, he didn’t have the courage
to commit suicide, as he still felt a powerful desire to stay alive.
“So long as I remain alive, I’ll have more opportunities in the
future. If I really can’t take it, I can commit suicide later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out to
grab the black-robed Godking, then put him away with a cold smile on
his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could guess at what
the Godking was thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To prevent a major
power from committing suicide was very difficult! However, Ji Ning
had acquired the many legacies and techniques of World God Northrest;
he had the necessary abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You sent my wife
into the Infinity Hells to suffer torment…and I promise you,
everything you did to her will be slowly repaid unto you a
thousandfold.” After putting away the Godking, Ning gave the
distant army of the Seamless Gate a final glance. The formations of
the Seamless Gate had already been dispersed, and looks of sadness,
disappointment, and pain could be seen in the eyes of those Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals. However, all they could do was allow the
major powers on their side to put them away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast majority of
them had been born and bred within the Three Realms. They all viewed
the Three Realms as their home. When the thought of how they would
soon have to venture through the unknown lands of the primordial
chaos, all of them were filled with restlessness and unease.
Still…since they had chosen the side of the Seamless Gate, they had
to live with their choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals of the Seamless Gate began to disappear as they were
all put away by their respective Daofathers. The Nuwa Alliance began
to disperse its formations as well. Keeping the formations active
required a large amount of Immortal energy, after all. Still, just to
be safe the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Nuwa Alliance
continued to remain close to each other, prepared to reform the
formation at a moment’s notice and do battle if necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at Daoist
Yuan.” Houyi stood by Ning’s side, staring at the rather
forlorn-looking Old Man Yuan who stood within the ranks of the
Seamless Gate’s armies. “I really don’t know what he was
thinking. He actually chose to join the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had chosen
the wrong side, which was why there was now only one road before
him…following the Seamless Gate and leaving the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To permit him to leave
the Three Realms instead of chasing after him and killing him was
already a tremendous show of grace on the part of the Nuwa Alliance.
There was no way they would permit him to remain here any longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’ll probably
find the primordial chaos to be a tough place to live,” Ning said
softly. “Still, it is for the best. He always did want to adventure
through it. I suppose we’re satisfying his dreams.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan stood by
himself at a corner of the Seamless Gate’s armies, watching all
this happen. There was a hint of disappointment in his eyes, and he
couldn’t help but sigh. “Alas. I really didn’t expect all of
this to end like this. So it was the Lord of the Demonheart who was
behind this war…and he ended up being killed as soon as he came
out. Houyi truly was a surprise for me! Still, Houyi’s usage of his
‘Godslayer’ has surely caused him grievious injuries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, an invisible
ripple of power centered around Old Man Yuan swept out, filling the
entire battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack, my
children.” Old Man Yuan’s voice rang out within the hearts of
certain individuals.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 26 - Unexpected Events
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
and the black-robed Ji Ning were standing shoulder-to-shoulder,
staring towards the Seamless Gate. Although they were in the process
of withdrawing, Ning’s heartforce was still kept active,
continuously rippling out as he kept a careful watch over the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this,
there was no such thing as being too careful. The enemy forces still
had the Lord of All Fiends, after all?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned slightly. Just now, there seemed to have been a small
ripple…but the ripple was so hidden and secretive that he couldn’t
completely detect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced all around
him, rather puzzled. As he did so, he told himself to be even more
careful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a towering
explosion of natural energy manifested in the form of an endless sea
of flames and a boundless sea of water. The massive attack swept
towards the grand army of the Nuwa Alliance as well as the major
powers of the Seamless Gate, catching both sides completely
off-guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi, what are you
doing?!” Three Purities, Tathagata, Shennong, and the others were
all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals of the Nuwa Alliance were completely caught off-guard.
Initially, they weren’t too worried as Fuxi was on their side; when
he used the Waterflame Apocalypse Formation in the past, he had made
sure that the water and the fire would stay away from them. This
time, however, the water and the fire swept straight through their
ranks. By the time they realized what was happening, it was far too
late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of agonized
cries rang out as countless Immortals and Fiendgods perished to the
endless floods of fire and water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, circles of
icy energy began to swirl around the area, furiously ablating the
power of the Waterflame Apolcaypse Formation. It managed to block and
stop parts of the water and the flame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One frozen lotus after
another was hanging in midair, emitting enormous amounts of frozen
energy that completely blocked off the effects of the Waterflame
Apocalypse Formation. Ji Ning was using his power as a first-tier
Ancestral Immortal to control this treasure, which Fuxi was merely
controlling his formation with the power of a third-tier Ancestral
Immortal. Thus, although Fuxi’s formation was far more formidable,
Ning was still able to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has this
happened…” Although Ning had managed to block the attack, he was
still in a dazed state of disbelief. He had become even more cautious
when he had sensed that ripple of power, but when Fuxi struck he was
still momentarily dazed. Although he quickly recovered and moved to
stop the attack, a large number of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
still perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior brothers Lord
Jiang and Junwu…” Ning’s heart was filled with pain and
confusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that brief moment,
the terrifying power of the Eternal Kindlefire and Arcane Moonwater
had caused more than thirty thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
to die! Far more died in that instant than had died during the entire
war. Many of Ning’s good friends, as well as many of the drinking
buddies and conversation partners he had met while wandering the
Three Realms, had died. In fact, many of the disciples of Mount
Innerheart had just perished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooooosh. The
thirty-six frozen lotuses hovered in the air, surrounding the Nuwa
Alliance’s army and defending them from the Waterflame Apocalypse
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Nuwa
Alliance was in a state of disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deaths of so many
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals had dazed them…but for Fuxi to be
the culprit had completely struck them dumb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GONGGONG!” An
agonized scream rang out. Shennong stared in disbelief at Gonggong,
who was standing right next to him. Gonggong had a cold look in his
face, and his right hand…had pierced directly into Shennong’s
chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Shennong’s
entire body disintegrated. As Shennong died, a look of agony and pain
was in his eyes as he murmured his final words. “Gonggong is dead…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die,” Gonggong
said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kuafu, what are
you…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundergod attacked
me first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance suddenly found themselves thrown into chaos as a
furious battle broke out within their own ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was all too
sudden! Ji Ning, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Daoist Three Purities,
Buddha Jueming, Houyi, and the others were all stunned. Fuxi had
first activated the ‘Waterflame Apocalypse Formation’ and
attempted to wipe out all their Empyrean Gods and True Immortals with
utter cruelty…and then Elder God Gonggong and other major powers
had suddenly attacked them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop fighting!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Buddha
Jueming, Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata, and the others began
to make their move. They had been vigilantly watching their
surroundings, and so they knew exactly which major powers had
attacked first. Thus, they immediately attacked the offenders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ambushers quickly
began to withdraw from the ranks of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop right there.”
Elder God Gonggong’s body suddenly transformed to become a million
kilometers tall, waves swirling around his entire body as though he
was an ocean world unto himself. His palm swung out, and as it did it
seemed to be a massive tidal wave that was crashing towards his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Triult Swords
transformed into that semi-translucent golden sword, then struck
directly against that titanic tidal wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His attack was actually
stopped!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gonggong is actually
this powerful?” Ning was stunned. Previously, Gonggong had battled
against Old Man Yuan for quite some time. From what Ning could tell,
Gonggong didn’t seem to be that powerful, appearing to be weaker
than Ning himself. But now, it was evident that Gonggong definitely
had the power of an elite Elder God. In fact, no one in either
alliance had anyone who was definitively more powerful than Gonggong
right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the deceased Lord
Demonheart was unquestionably more powerful than him, while Houyi had
been heavily injured and was no longer capable of slaying any Elder
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ink Bamboo, you…!”
Keeper Everwood stared in disbelief at the distant Daofather Ink
Bamboo. “Y-you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You hid your power
quite well.” Daofather Ink Bamboo gave him a cold glance, then
quickly fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate were suddenly thrown into turmoil as well as they began
attacking each other. The Lord of All Fiends was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase him down!”
The Lord of All Fiends quickly came back to his senses. His eyes
became filled with fury and murder as he chased after the major
powers who had just launched sneak attacks against their friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can stop right
there.” Old Man Yuan, who was within the Seamless Gate’s ranks,
said these words softly as he flicked out his horsetail whisk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Countless white strands flew out from his whisk, covering the skies
like a series of giant white waves that protected the fleeing,
traitorous major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Murder
radiated from the Lord Allfiend’s eyes as he clutched his weapon.
He had never wanted to kill someone more than he did right now. Only
a few major powers had died during the battle between the two sides,
but this sudden ambush had resulted in him losing more than twenty of
his major powers! This loss caused the Lord of All Fiends to go
berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Old Man Yuan,
who was protecting these traitors? The Lord of All Fiends wanted to
kill him more than anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. The white
strands of the horsetail whisk undulated, blocking off all paths. No
matter how the Lord of All Fiends tried to move past them, he was
unable to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the Lord of
All Fiends came to a halt. All of the traitors had already fled. He
stared coldly at the distant Old Man Yuan, who had used the horsetail
whisk in his hands to prevent any pursuit. The traitors of the
Seamless Gate had joined together with the Nuwa Alliance, and they
had docilely flown to Old Man Yuan’s side as if they were children
running to the side of their father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
fell completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance had
been dealt a grievous blow. More than thirty thousand Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals had perished, while more than twenty major powers
had died. Fortunately, Ning had been able to block the Waterflame
Apocalypse Formation; otherwise, their losses would have been even
greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Seamless
Gate’s major powers had collected its Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals, more than twenty major powers had been slain. The Seamless
Gate had fewer major powers than the Nuwa Alliance to begin with,
which meant that their casualties were proportionally higher. Once
those major powers had died, the traitors who had slain them had also
seized their items and estate-treasures, including the Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals contained inside. It was obvious what would happen
to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two alliances both
stared furiously at the traitors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan continued
to hold his horsetail whisk in his hands, a smile on his face. Behind
him stood a group of towering major powers, including Gonggong, Fuxi,
Daofather Ink Bamboo, and more than thirty other True Gods and
Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power which Old Man
Yuan controlled was actually just as formidable as the power of
either alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nuwa Alliance
lost thirty thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.” Old Man
Yuan smiled. “I’ll make things fair. Children, release the
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the Seamless
Gate traitors released the many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals they
were holding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than twenty major
powers of the Seamless Gate had been slain, while more than ten had
turned traitor. Each major power had collected nearly ten thousand
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, and so a total of nearly thirty
thousand were released!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Seamless Gate’s losses during the previous battle had been
very heavy; thirty thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals
represented more than half of their total forces!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can all die
now.” Old Man Yuan laughed calmly, the countless strands of his
horsetail whisk surrounding every single captured member of the
Seamless Gate. Before the abductees even had a chance to react…boom!
All of them were slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood, Lord
Allfiend, and the others all stared with bloodshot eyes, but to no
avail…all of the captured Seamless Gate members were slain.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had just
slain nearly thirty thousand Empyrean Gods and True Immortals with a
smile on his face. This caused the Seamless Gate and the Nuwa
Alliance to feel two things…cold fear, and burning rage! They all
stared at Old Man Yuan and the large group of major powers behind
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all dead.”
Lord Tathagata had a pained look on his face. “Those ‘traitors’…all
of them are already dead.”

Chapter 27 - The Nine Divine Generals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why would you say
that they are dead?” Old Man Yuan flicked his whisk, a smile on his
face. “They are alive and well. Isn’t that right, Gonggong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Gonggong spoke in a low, respectful voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon Gonggong say the
word ‘master’, whispers broke out within both the Nuwa Alliance
and the Seamless Gate. Looks of pain and hatred appeared in the eyes
of Ji Ning, Daoist Three Purities, and the others. They wanted
nothing more than to kill Old Man Yuan right now. They weren’t
fools; they could tell that it was Old Man Yuan behind all of this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it was you, Old
Man Yuan, who caused them to turn traitor?” The Lord of All Fiends
growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all my
children. Why speak of ‘betrayal’?” Old Man Yuan smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in both
alliances, be it Ji Ning, Daoist Three Purities, the Lord of All
Fiends, or Keeper Everwood, was completely enraged. Still, they knew
that they had to maintain their calm. They knew very well that this
was a critical moment; they had to be even more careful than they
were before. Old Man Yuan’s ambitions were truly terrifying, and he
was in control of so many major powers. Once he mobilized them…he
would be even more dangerous than Lord Demonheart had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve taken
control of them?” Ji Ning suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soul control. This was
something which terrified any and every cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It meant to be
controlled, to lose all free will, to feel complete and slavish
devotion. If the master ordered the soulslave to die, the soulslave
would commit suicide with a smile on his face. This was what made
soul control so terrifying! Once you were controlled, it might look
as though you were still alive, but you would lose all of your free
will. It would be no different from death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos, there were certain supreme major powers who knew
soul control techniques. However, they would generally only be able
to use it against weaklings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, Old Man
Yuan had actually been able to make the likes of Fuxi and Gonggong
his soulslaves. This meant that he was most likely incredibly skilled
in ways of heartforce, perhaps to the point of being an actual,
terrifying Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He definitely is a
Heartforce Cultivator.” Godfiend and Witherspike were both watching
from far away, and both of them were stunned. Saber immediately said,
“To be able to stealthily take control over so many major powers
without revealing any flaws at all…this Old Man Yuan is definitely
a terrifyingly powerful Heartforce Cultivator. He’s even more
terrifying than Houyi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For someone like
Houyi to appear within this local chaosworld is one thing, but how
could a true Heartforce Cultivator appear here? Aren’t they
supposed to be extremely rare and extremely mysterious, with very few
legacies left behind for others?” Godfiend Witherspike felt his
heart grow cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No Heartforce
Cultivator could be underestimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce…it was
ephemeral, formless, and extremely strange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators of the
endless primordial chaos were primarily divided up into three major
paths: Fiendgod Refiners, Ki Refiners, and the mysterious Heartforce
Cultivators! Fiendgod Refiners primarily focused on refining the
body, Ki Refiners focused on cultivating their Immortal energy, and
Heartforce Cultivators focused on cultivating the ephemeral power of
heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just before you
joined the Seamless Gate, you sought me out,” Ning said. “You
suddenly launched a heartforce attack against me. Were you attempting
to take control over me as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Old Man Yuan
smiled. “Your rise to power was simply far too sudden, much faster
than I had expected. Given that the Endwar was nigh, I didn’t have
any time to slowly infiltrate your soul defenses. To be honest, I
acted against you in a brutish and rather inelegant manner, and I
knew that my chances of succeeding would be much lower as a result.
When I took over Gonggong and Fuxi, I slowly worked on them over the
course of countless years, causing them to fall under my control
without even knowing about it. I tried to do the same against Three
Purities and Tathagata as well. These locals naturally weren’t able
to notice a thing, but their hearts were far too powerful. There was
no way for me to truly control them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Three
Purities and Tathagata were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So Old Man Yuan had
tried to secretly take control of the two of them as well. They had
automatically defended against it without even knowing about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was simply too
terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, you local
yokels…how could you possibly understand how truly formidable
heartforce is?” Old Man Yuan laughed coldly, then glanced at the
distant Houyi with a look of praise in his eyes. “But for someone
like you, Houyi, to emerge in a backwater chaosworld is quite
admirable. You received no legacies at all, but you were actually
able to come up with a few heartforce techniques on your own.
Although you are a child when compared to true Heartforce
Cultivators, you are still quite impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce
Cultivator?” Lord Tathagata’s face changed. “You are a
Heartforce Cultivator?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had acquired quite
a bit of information from alien Outsiders they had slain. They knew a
bit about what Heartforce Cultivators were and knew exactly how
terrifying they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Old Man Yuan
smiled and nodded, continuing to look at the distant Houyi. “Houyi,
I actually wanted to take control over you a long time ago. I knew it
would be easy, because your spirit has an obvious weakness…her.”
Old Man Yuan waved his hand, causing an absolutely peerless beauty to
appear by his side. The woman looked towards Old Man Yuan with
absolute adoration on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chang’e.”
Houyi’s face changed. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I said, your flaw
is obvious. Although your heartforce is powerful, I’m completely
convinced that I could take control over you. Alas…after the war
that ended the Primordial Era, I was never able to find you. I had no
chance to seize your soul.” Old Man Yuan shook his head. “So you
were hiding by Subhuti’s side all this time. You hid yourself quite
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did you do to
Chang’e…” Houyi was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” Old Man
Yuan glanced at Chang’e, who stood by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chang’e called out in
a soft voice, “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sight caused Houyi
to feel even more miserable. Still, he quickly regained his calm…but
his eyes remained as cold as the edge of a blade as he stared at Old
Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop trying to scare
me. You can’t actually kill me with your eyes, you know.” Old Man
Yuan shook his head. “If you were at full power, I’d need to use
a bit of effort to deal with you, but now, after killing the Lord of
the Demonheart? Hmph. Although I look down upon you local bumpkins, I
have to admit that he had the power of a supreme Elder God. In
killing him, you most assuredly did considerable damage to your own
vital essence as well. I could just stand here and let you attack me
as you please, but even if you used up all of your divine power you
still wouldn’t be able to kill me. And…I won’t actually let you
hit me, of course. Your techniques might be useful against other
major powers, but against me? You are still just a kid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
said in a cold voice, “From what you are saying, I assume you
already started to take part in our wars during the Primordial Era?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan said, “I
arrived in this place during the Primordial Era. Back then, it was
still the Pangu Chaosworld. I was heavily injured when I arrived, so
I possessed Old Man Yuan and took his body for my own. Back then, he
wasn’t that powerful, and he was a very solitary figure. After I
took his body, I slowly began to grow more powerful and took control
over other major powers. I’ve been here all along, partially
because I wanted to take the Worldheart, and partially because I wish
to acquire Subhuti’s spacetime techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You honor me too
much.” A white-haired old man in Daoist robes appeared next to Ji
Ning. It was Subhuti’s incarnation. “So all those years ago, when
you risked your life to save this old Daoist, it was all part of your
plan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…who in the
puny little Pangu Chaosworld could possibly do anything to me?
Everything was part of my plan.” Old Man Yuan shook his head. “The
Dao of Spacetime…it truly is quite incredible. Once you reach a
truly high level in this Dao, you can effortlessly travel through
both space and time, making it impossible for your foes to find and
kill you. I really did want to acquire those abilities of yours and
learn them from you…but you refused to teach them to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have no talent
in that regard.” Subhuti shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You simply refused
to give me the techniques you came up with.” Old Man Yuan’s gaze
was icy cold. In the primordial chaos, spacetime techniques were
considered incredibly valuable techniques, far more valuable than
most divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was a prime
example of why this was the case. At his level of mastery, he could
leave a place whenever he wished. He was different from the Lord of
All Fiends; the Lord of All Fiends had managed to merge the Dao of
Wind and the Dao of Space to an unfathomable degree, resulting in him
being able to move at incredible speeds. Subhuti, however, had
completely surpassed speed itself. He operated in the realm of
spacetime and was able to transport himself to a completely different
time continuum, making it impossible for any enemies to catch up to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was quite a
terrifying ability, especially when used for subterfuge,
assassination, or escaping. The value of this technique was actually
greater than that of the Worldheart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, I’m a
patient man.” Old Man Yuan smiled. “I’m never hasty. I always
wait for the end before making any move. I was quite patient during
the war that ended the Primordial Era as well…and it was a good
thing I did. I watched as Nuwa, Lord Demonheart, and the Lord of All
Things fought against each other. I saw Nuwa make her sudden
breakthrough and dominate all her foes…and because I waited and
watched, I managed to avoid bringing disaster upon myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, however,
the two sides decided to stop fighting, forcing me to make my move.”
Old Man Yuan shook his head. “A true pity. As a result, I won’t
be able to acquire Subhuti’s spacetime technique. This disappoints
me greatly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a secret
sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had only
transmitted his spacetime technique to Redsnow, teaching it to no
others at all. The only people who even knew that Redsnow had learned
this technique were Ji Ning, Crazy Ji, and Subhuti himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it wasn’t for
that, Old Man Yuan would probably have gone after Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spacetime techniques
are actually this valuable?” True God Redsnow, protected behind the
Nuwa Alliance’s formations, was shocked upon hearing this. He had
lost one of his clones during the chaotic battle just now, but
fortunately he had a total of eighteen clones. Prior to this, he had
simply believed spacetime techniques to be powerful…but he had no
idea that they were this powerful! Now, it seemed as though the
‘Worldheart’, an item which countless alien Outsiders would go
mad for, was not necessarily as valuable as his spacetime techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. Can’t
win’m all. If I can’t get it, I can’t get it.” Old Man Yuan
turned his head to glance at the distant dark-golden castle.
“Witherspike, do you still remember that black lotus? If you do,
give me a hand. I’ll definitely reward you heavily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike
and Saber were located deep within that dark-golden castle. Upon
hearing these words, both their faces changed, with Witherspike’s
face turning completely ashen. He had always believed Old Man Yuan to
be a local, but upon listening Old Man Yuan’s soliloquy he started
to have a feeling that something was off. Now…he finally understood
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s him.”
Godfiend Witherspike was stunned. “Him. He’s one of the Nine
Divine Generals under the command of God Emperor Blacklotus…the
Mindlord. Why has he appeared in this backwater?! Let’s leave!
Let’s leave right now! We need to get the hell out of here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the Nine
Divine Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus?” Saber’s face turned
pale as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the nine were
supremely powerful Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals who were
utterly, terrifyingly powerful. Compared to them, lone wanderers like
Witherspike and Saber were nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark-golden castle
instantly fled, disappearing like a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How useless.” Old
Man Yuan watched as the dark-golden castle fled at high speed, then
shook his head. “Kids like them are as slippery as eels. As soon as
they sense a bit of danger, they’ll immediately slip away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. Chang’e is an
important part of the Houyi legend in Chinese mythology. She was his
wife, and in many versions of the story she betrayed him, be it
intentionally or accidentally.  ↩

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
dark-golden castle had fled far away, Godfiend Witherspike had left
an incarnation behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually one
of the Nine Divine Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus…” Godfiend
Witherspike watched from afar. “Hmph. I need to keep my true body
far away from this man, but this battle is still worth watching. I
might still have a chance.” Godfiend Witherspike was far less
nervous now that his true body wasn’t at any risk. There was no
longer any danger here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nine Divine
Generals are all famous figures, with the Mindlord being a
particularly formidable Heartforce Cultivator.” Godfiend
Witherspike’s eyes suddenly lit up. “They’ve started to fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that the
formations which Nuwa left behind are just so-so after all.” Old
Man Yuan said calmly, “Assemble my formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Gonggong,
Daofather Ink Bamboo, Fuxi, and the other major powers all quickly
assembled into formations. They drew upon the power of chaos,
centering it around Old Man Yuan and forming an enormous formation
around him. A giant black lotus flower began to bloom around him, a
lotus flower with a total of three lotus petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan stood atop
the center of the black lotus, flywhisk in hand. Next to him stood
Chang’e, the mistress of the Lunar Palace which was also known as
the Frozen Palace. Elder God Gonggong, Daofather Ink Bamboo, and Fuxi
each commanded a squad of major powers, with the three squads
standing on those three black lotus petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos energy began to
surge violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan and his
subordinates had joined their powers together perfectly, and their
combined aura was far more powerful than that of Lord Demonheart’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Old Man
Yuan’s eyes were filled with lofty disdain, as though he was
staring down at a pile of ants. This was his true face, the face of
the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate and
the Nuwa Alliance had both become enraged long ago. The sudden
betrayal had caused devastating losses to both their sides, and their
hearts were filled with endless hatred. The only reason why they had
not attacked was because they wanted to get a better understanding of
Old Man Yuan first. Now, they understood that Old Man Yuan was
actually a terrifyingly powerful alien Outsider, one who had lain in
wait for a long period of time and who had silently taken control
over quite a few major powers. He was an even more terrifying figure
than the long-deceased Lord of All Things had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three dazzling streaks
of light shot through the air towards Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These streaks of light
were Ji Ning’s Triult Swords, Daoist Three Purities’ Immortal
Slaying Swords, and the Lord of All Fiend’s shuttle. These were the
three fastest attackers. Because Old Man Yuan was somewhat closer to
the Seamless Gate, the Lord of All Fiend’s attack was actually the
first to arrive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You backwater
locals.” Old Man Yuan calmly willed the lotus petals to swivel
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The sharp shuttle
stabbed directly against the slowly swiveling black lotus petals but
was completely blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! The attacks
from the Triult Swords and the Immortal Slaying Swords arrived as
well. The black lotus simply slowly swiveled to block the two
attacks. Although it trembled, it was still able to endure the
strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the enormous
lotus petals gently brushed against the body of the Lord of All
Fiends, who had moved into close combat range. He was knocked flying
backwards and he vomited up a mouthful of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t take
those attacks head-on. Those lotus petals are as powerful as
Demonheart was.” The Lord of All Fiends sent a hurried mental
message to the others. He was more than fast enough to have dodged
the attack, but he wanted to test those black lotus petals and see
how powerful they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the major
powers in both alliances to feel their hearts grow cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Three
Purities, the Lord of All Fiends…the three of them striking out
essentially represented the three most powerful attackers in both
alliances striking out. Although they had caused the black lotus
petals to tremble, it was still clearly quite stable and far from the
point of breaking down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And a single, simple
strike from a petal was comparable to a blow from Lord Demonheart?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">T-this…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The enormous
black lotus came smashing straight towards the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should we stop
him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance were both panicking. After
suffering such heavy losses a few moments ago, both sides were now
much weaker than before. Even the attacks of Ji Ning, Three Purities,
and the Lord of All Fiends had been useless against the black lotus.
Most likely, even if everyone in both alliances attacked together
they still wouldn’t be able to breach its defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a solution.
It might be able to kill Old Man Yuan.” A voice suddenly rang out
in the minds of the overlords of both the Nuwa Alliance and the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti.” Three
Purities, Tathagata, and the others were intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Ji Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was standing
atop the clouds, staring at past the skies towards the war in the
Three Realms. He was able to see everything very clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong…given
what has come to pass, it is time to use that flower.” A hint of
grief could be seen in Subhuti’s eyes as a fiery red flower
appeared in his hands. “A pity that you won’t be able to see it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them were
standing together at a farm deep within the primordial chaos. There
was a thatched cottage by the side of the farm, and Shennong, dressed
as an old farmer, was smiling as he pointed towards a certain plot.
“See that, Subhuti?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The restrictive
formations covering the field had already been withdrawn, revealing
its true appearances. There were small creeks and many different
plots, with a fiery red flower having appeared in the very center of
the field.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Subhuti paused for a moment, then his face changed slightly. “I-I…why
do I sense your aura in it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong said softly,
“That’s because I used my own blood and soul to nourish it.
Finally, just before the Endwar, it has come to maturity. This is the
most terrifying plant that I have ever created in all my life.
Normally, I delight in creating medicinal plants that can save lives.
But this time…I have a bad feeling about this Endwar. I feel as
though there has to be someone causing it, someone scheming behind
our backs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Who is causing
this great calamity?” Subhuti frowned as well. “The Seamless Gate
has coexisted peacefully with us for countless ages now. Why, then,
am I now subconsciously sensing that destiny is telling us that
either we survive or they survive? What is happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve poured my
heart and soul into the art of plants and flowers.” Shennong
smiled. “I’m afraid that I won’t be of that much use when the
war begins. I suppose this flower is the only real contribution I can
make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This flower is for
you to use.” Shennong looked at Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me?” Subhuti was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa trusted you. I
trust you as well.” Shennong nodded. “This flower has a very
simple name. It is the ‘Lifeseizer Flower’. When the flower
blooms, it shall seize away life! Right now, it has yet to bloom.
Once you fill it with your divine power, you’ll be able to make it
bloom…and once it does, everything within thirty meters shall be
attacked by it. Even Elder Gods will see their souls shattered and
even their truesouls annihilated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was shocked by
what he heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, you need to
get within thirty meters of your target,” Subhuti said. “My
concern is that the instigator of the Endwar will appear and be too
powerful for me to handle. If I’m too weak, I won’t even be able
to draw near him. But you, Subhuti, have incredible mastery over the
Dao of Spacetime. You can silently draw near our opponent…although
you’ll probably have to sacrifice a bit of divine power once you
lose that clone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Subhuti
nodded. This definitely was a killer weapon for them to keep hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti…remember,
you can’t use this weapon casually. It can only be used once, after
all,” Shennong said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Subhuti nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong nodded slowly
as well. “I hope to one day see the beauty of the flower
blooming…and yet, I also hope that day will never come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the flower to bloom
meant that they were in truly desperate straits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You might be
worrying just a bit too much.” Subhuti smiled. “You know how
powerful our side is, and we also have the three guardian formations.
On the whole, we should be overwhelmingly more powerful than the
Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can predict
the future. It is best to be cautious.” Shennong turned to stare at
the creeks flowing through his fields and the tiny little eddies
within them. “You and I are different. Suiren and I both watched as
our fragile little human race slowly rose to prominence. Many of our
comrades died during that process. That’s why I know that life and
death are both unpredictable things. There will always be unexpected
events in every war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at those little
eddies in the creeks. They can represent all the deceased heroes of
the human race. Their risked their lives for the sake of giving their
descendants a brighter, safer future. This tribulation is a great
tribulation for all the Three Realms. I hope that the Three Realms
will be able to safely endure it and once more return to peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Subhuti
sighed as well. He, too, was concerned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war of the
Primordial Era had resulted in both chaosworlds being shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would happen this
time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us fight. If
someone wishes to take over our home or destroy it, we shall fight
them to the bitter end.” Shennong waved his hand, causing the
flower to fly over and land within it. He lowered his head to look at
it, then handed it to Subhuti. “I entrust it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Subhuti
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The present day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a solution
that might allow us to kill Old Man Yuan.” Subhuti’s voice rang
out within the minds of Ji Ning, Jueming, Three Purities, Houyi,
Everwood, and Allfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as I can get
within thirty meters of him, I’ll have a very good chance of
killing him! Even if he doesn’t die, he will still be heavily
wounded,” Subhuti said. “However, the issue is that this black
lotus formation has completely locked down spacetime around him.
There’s no way for me to draw near him. I need all of you to help
me breach that black lotus formation. Without it locking down
spacetime, I’ll be able to instantly appear next to him and launch
my attack.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti, are you
really sure about this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we can
temporarily breach the formation, Old Man Yuan has a host of servants
guarding him. He himself is also unfathomably powerful.” Everyone
began to question him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti continued to
stand there atop the clouds of the Crescent world. His divine body
suddenly split in half, resulting in a second Subhuti appearing next
to him. “I’m sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that he had
faith in himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was that he had
faith in Shennong! Shennong had said that even Elder Gods would see
their souls shattered and their truesouls destroyed by this flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Keeper
Everwood sent mentally, “Subhuti, my old friend, I believe in you.
I never would’ve thought that we would have the chance to fight
alongside each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe in you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no other
options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, how should
we break that black lotus formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The overlords were all
speaking mentally to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi had been silent
this entire time. Suddenly, he sent mentally, “I need your help.
All of you, attack the black lotus formation! Put it under some
pressure, and then I’ll use my archery to break through it with one
strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the othesr
were all stunned upon hearing Houyi say this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had great
confidence in Houyi, because Houyi was the one who had slain Lord
Demonheart! However, Houyi clearly was heavily injured right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This arrow will be
my most powerful arrow, an arrow that will be far stronger than the
ones I used to kill Lord Demonheart,” Houyi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. We’ll do as
you say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various major
powers quickly came to a decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, we no
longer have any other way out of this.” Lord Tathagata let out a
growl as he and the Empyrean Gods around him all stared at the black
lotus formation as it assaulted the distant army of the Seamless
Gate. Everyone’s eyes were filled with hatred…and then they
summoned the natural energy of Heaven and Earth, quickly forming a
Pangu Genesis Formation around Lord Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…we’ve
been forced to the brink. My fellow Daoists, come fight by my side!”
Daoist Three Purities let out a laugh as the Pure Yang True Immortals
around him quickly joined together into the Nuwa Heaven Repairing
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow
Diremonster brethren, let us kill this Old Man Yuan! After we kill
him, we’ll drink and feast together!” Sun Wukong let out a loud
roar which was immediately followed by the cries and cheers of the
many Diremonster Gods around him as they formed into a Pangu Genesis
Formation around him. The massive Pangu-Wukong charged forward
through the Void towards their enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Yuan…today
is the day you shall die.” Buddha Amitabha took control of a Nuwa
Heaven Repairing Formation as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kuafu…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jade Cauldron…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Maitreya…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these powerful
figures who were close to the overlord level took control of a grand
formation. None of the Empyrean Gods or True Immortals within the
formations shirked back from their duty. They all fearlessly followed
their major power leaders into war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amitabaha…to be
able to join so many friends in battle is truly a blessing,” Buddha
Jueming said with a smile as he sped through the Void towards the
black lotus formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brightmoon.” In
this moment…Ning’s mind was filled with images of his daughter,
Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one will be able
to harm you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black lightning
serpent streaked across the Void, charging towards the black lotus
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation had been watching this battle from afar. Upon seeing all
the experts of the Three Realms charge straight towards the black
lotus formation, Witherspike felt astonishment. He couldn’t help
but reminisce to himself as he murmured softly, “By all rights, the
Mindlord isn’t someone that these locals can defeat. They are fools
to true! And yet…when I see this, I can’t help but hope for their
victory, much like how I hoped that my own homeland would win that
great war. Alas…in the end, this world is a world where the strong
reign supreme.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan showed no
mercy at all. The black lotus petals ground away at the attackers
like a meat grinder, quickly causing the deaths of many major powers
and the destruction of multiple formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Buddha
Jueming, Keeper Everwood, and the Lord of All Fiends had charged to
the very front, seeking to aid the other major powers as much as they
could. They relied on the power of their divine bodies or the
strength of their defensive techniques to charge into the most
dangerous situations, ensuring that their allies would suffer fewer
losses as they furiously attacked the black lotus formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Triult Swords, the
Immortal Slaying Swords, and other streaks of jade light, bloody
light, sword-light, and various Chaos weapons all struck out towards
the grand formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both alliances were
attacking with full strength, holding nothing back whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, Houyi calmly watched this all happen. “Everyone…I
promise that I will not let you down.” He drew his bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had been
calmly watching everything happen from within his black lotus
formation. Upon seeing Houyi draw his bow, Old Man Yuan’s face
changed slightly as he stared at Houyi. He knew exactly how
formidable every single Heartforce Cultivator could be. Although
Houyi only knew some techniques he had devised on his own, he had
been able to use those techniques to kill the Lord of the Demonheart!
Old Man Yuan didn’t dare to underestimate Houyi’s attacks. This
was one of the reasons why he had taken control over Chang’e all
those years ago; he wanted to be able to influence and perhaps
restrict Houyi’s actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi.” Old Man
Yuan issued a silent order, causing Chang’e to immediately fly in
front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to act
against me, you’ll have to kill Chang’e first.” Although Old
Man Yuan felt confident that he could handle this next arrow, he
still acted with caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi.” As Houyi
drew his bow, he felt as though he had returned to those bygone days,
the most beautiful days in his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi, have a taste.
Does it taste good?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything you make
is wonderful, Chang’e.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although certain things
happened afterwards that broke his heart, the beauty of those oldest
memories had never faded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi smiled as he
pulled the bow to a full draw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the Void shook
as a flood of chaos energy began to fill Houyi’s divine bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the bowstring
also began to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi’s divine body
transformed into a breathtakingly brilliant beacon of light…and
then all the light was also poured into that arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos energy was his
bow. Heartforce was his bowstring. His own body, his very life
itself, was his arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an arrow which
Houyi had developed over the course of countless years of melancholy
and spiritual sorrow. An arrow which required the life of the archer…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bowstring sang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow flew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing left in
the Void was Houyi’s divine bow, which seemed to be sobbing in
pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow pierced
through the skies, gathering and swallowing all of the chaos energy
and natural energy nearby. This arrow streaked through the Void like
a meteor, becoming increasingly brilliant as it flew forward. The
entire Void seemed to have turned silent. All the major powers,
Empyrean Gods, and True Immortals were staring at this arrow. They
were frantically assaulting the black lotus formation, precisely so
that they could give this arrow a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They understood that
Houyi had sacrificed his very life for this arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they felt
sorrow, they also felt hope. Hope that this arrow would succeed. If
necessary, they would be willing to make the exact same sacrifice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A suicide arrow.”
Protected by his black lotus formation, Old Man Yuan frowned. “This
Houyi truly is a madman. He is tremendously talented in heartforce,
but why is it that every single technique he came up with is
borderline suicidal? He used what could be described as a desperation
attack in order to kill Lord Demonheart, but this arrow? It’s
completely a suicide attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow was too fast.
There was no way to dodge it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These madmen.” Old
Man Yuan frowned. The grand formation was being battered by everyone
in both alliances. Although the individual cultivators were quite
weak, when they joined forces they were so powerful that even Lord
Demonheart would find it hard to withstand them. The black lotus
formation truly was under a significant amount of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow had expanded
to become an utterly enormous comet, and it slammed directly against
the black lotus formation, causing a tremendous boom. The formation
had already taken a tremendous amount of punishment…and now, it
could take no more. With a bang, it blew apart and dissipated, but as
the lotus petals broke apart the giant comet became much dimmer as
well. The arrow within it could now be seen as well as it continued
to shoot straight towards Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan stood
there, horsetail whisk in hand. The strands of his whisk coiled
around him, forming multiple layers of protection. He also ordered
Chang’e to stand in front of him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow streaked
forward without changing course.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It pierced both through
the body of Chang’e and the whisk-barriers. As it appeared before
Old Man Yuan, Old Man Yuan struck out with his palm against the tip
of the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan was
knocked quite a few steps back. Blood leaked out from the corner of
his lips, but he grinned. “You were able to breach my formation,
but in doing so you lost all your power. You were only able to
consume up a small bit of my divine power.” The only thing which he
was worried about was Houyi and his arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chang’e fell to her
knees, holding a hand to her chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A blurry shadow
appeared in front of them, a shadow with Houyi’s appearance. It was
his truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chang’e.”
Houyi’s shadow looked at Chang’e. He gently stretched out his
hand, touching her face. He said in a soft voice, “I…never…hated
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chang’e just looked
at him, her eyes as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…two tears
silently streaked down her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She felt pain in her
heart. She knew exactly what had happened, but there was nothing she
could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the two
tears streak down the face of Chang’e, Houyi’s shadow smiled
gently. And then…it dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used a suicide
arrow attack, but was actually able to keep his truesoul intact for a
brief moment out of pure willpower?” Old Man Yuan glanced coldly at
Chang’e. She had fallen to the ground and her aura was already
beginning to weaken. Her body had been penetrated by that terrifying
arrow; how could she possibly survive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Old Man
Yuan waved his hand, causing a surge of divine power to sweep out and
smash down upon her body, transforming it into ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Old Man
Yuan’s face changed…because right behind him, a white-haired old
man in a Daoist robe had suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly dazzlingly
flower flew out from Subhuti’s hand, and as it did so it began to
bloom. The petals of the flower began to spread out, revealing what
could truly be described as the most indescribably beautiful flower
to ever grace the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Buddha
Jueming, Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, the Lord
of All Fiends, the Keeper of the Everwood, Kuafu, Sun Wukong, Crazy
Ji, Jade Cauldron, Buddha Maitreya, Amitabha, and all the other major
powers were watching. They stared at that flower as it bloomed.
Everything they had done…Houyi’s sacrifice…it was all for the
sake of letting this flower bloom.

Chapter 30 - Unto Death
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flower bloomed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Subhuti watched
as the flower bloomed…and then, his gaze grew dim. Although divine
power still rippled through his body, his aura of life had completely
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
watched from afar, staring hopefully at Old Man Yuan who stood at the
center of that giant black lotus. A look of horror appeared on Old
Man Yuan’s face, and his aura trembled then weakened dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all stunned. The Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms
were in a state of shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually didn’t
die.” Daoist Subhuti, back within the Crescent world, let out a
soft sigh. His own clone had been instantly slain and so he knew
exactly how terrifyingly powerful that flower had been. Old Man Yuan,
however, had actually been able to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shennong said that
even Elder Gods would have their souls shattered and their truesouls
wiped out. Old Man Yuan, however, is far more powerful than ordinary
Elder Gods.” A hint of grief was in Subhuti’s eyes. He understood
that since the Lifeseizer Flower had failed to seize Old Man Yuan’s
life, the upcoming battle would be the cruelest, deadliest battle of
them all. If Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Buddha
Jueming, Crazy Ji, Ji Ning, and the others were not able to withstand
Old Man Yuan…then all living beings in the Three Realms would truly
be annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That flower…?”
Godfiend Witherspike’s incarnation was still watching from afar. As
he saw this, he nodded to himself. “Subhuti’s clone no longer has
any aura of life around it, but the body of the clone is fine. It
would appear as though that flower doesn’t distinguish between
friend or foe; it should be something that attacks all souls and
truesouls around it. Alas…the flower might’ve been powerful, but
the Mindlord is a powerful Heartforce Cultivator. Heartforce
Cultivators have more techniques for protecting their souls and
truesouls than ayone else. Still, it looks as though the Mindlord was
heavily injured; even his life aura has grown unstable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities,
Lord Tathagata, the Lord of All Fiends, Keeper Everwood, Ji Ning,
Buddha Jueming, and the rest of the major powers were briefly
disappointed, but then their eyes turned red with bloodlust as they
let out furious roars and began to launch all-out attacks with
abandon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s face
turned ugly. He barked out in a cold voice, “Kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew quite well that
this was the critical moment. As he gave the order, his soulslaves
immediately sprang into action, forming into multiple smaller
formations and engaging the Nuwa Alliance and Seamless Gate in
battle. The three guardian formations of the Nuwa Alliance were
particularly deadly, and the ones under the command of Buddha
Maitreya, Buddha Amitabha, and Daoist Jade Cauldron were actually
able to hold the upper hand, tying down the likes of Elder God
Gonggong for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus Guard.”
Old Man Yuan sat down into the lotus position and activated a secret
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the area
around him transformed into countless lotus flowers. He was seated
atop a lotus throne, while the sea of black lotuses around him and
spread out to cover an area of nearly ten thousand kilometers.
Spacetime around him instantly became sealed, blocking out any
movement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.” Daoist
Three Purities, Lord Tathagata, the Lord of All Fiends, Keeper
Everwood, Ji Ning, and Buddha Jueming were clearly more powerful than
the other major powers. They either charging forward alone or
attacked from afar with the help of mighty formations, furiously
assaulting Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were seven
figures in total, as Ji Ning was using both his true body and his
Primaltwin. This represented seven elite Elder Gods assaulting Old
Man Yuan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
forces on both sides had joined together to attack him; even Lord
Demonheart at his peak would have been suppressed in power.
However…although Old Man Yuan had clearly been heavily injured, he
was able to rely on his ‘Blacklotus Guard’ to block all attacks.
The lotus petals slowly swiveled around him, rendering the area
around him completely impervious to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan was one of
the Nine Divine Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus. He was a supreme
Elder God, and an extraordinary one at that! He was most skilled in
heartforce and knew many secret arts, and he naturally knew the
‘black lotus techniques’ which God Emperor Blacklotus had
developed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Black Lotus
Guardian was something which Ji Ning and the others were not capable
of breaching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Old Man
Yuan, seated atop the lotus throne, had an ugly look on his face. He
reached out with his right hand which instantly expanded in size and
glowed with black light, stretching out hundreds of thousands of
kilometers to strike at Daoist Three Purities. Daoist Three Purities
wasn’t too far away, as he had to rely on his Immortal Slaying
Swords to attack. Only Houyi, who attacked with arrows, was capable
of attacking from a greater distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old man Yuan’s
fingers reached out towards him like the very pillars of heavens
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
black-robed Ning immediately willed his Triult Swords to arc out in a
streak of curved light, stabbing towards that palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daoist
Three Purities also used his Immortal Slaying Swords to strike out at
the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And here I was
worrying that he would keep hiding inside without coming out.” The
Lord of All Fiends was the fastest of them all. He instantly appeared
next to Old Man Yuan’s elongated right arm, then whipped down his
long shuttle at the arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attacks from the
three major powers forced Old Man Yuan to withdraw his arm once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! His body is
comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic treasure?” This exchange of
blows caused the hearts of Daoist Three Purities, Ji Ning, and
Allfiend to clench. When their attacks had landed on Old Man Yuan’s
arm, they had only been able to cause a few sparks to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that I’d have to fight with full power in order to kill you
backwater locals of the Three Realms. That flower should have been
devised by Shennong, I believe? It was quite nasty.” Old Man Yuan’s
face was quite pale. He put away his horsetail whisk, then a total of
six arms suddenly appeared on his body. His six arms all dramatically
elongated, striking out at the various major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan continued
to sit there atop his black lotus throne, striking out with his six
arms in every direction, his hands executing different types of
marvelous palm-arts and finger-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heavy injury he
suffered just now was to his soul. Now, he’s using up his divine
power as well. Every bit of divine power he uses up, a bit of his
soul is used up as well.” Lord Tathagata sent mentally, “Everyone,
keep fighting. If we can hold on for long enough, he won’t be able
to endure it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you can go
die.” Old Man Yuan also knew that he wouldn’t be able to stay in
battle for too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with six
attacking arms at once, Ning and the others had to fend for
themselves by themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s giant
palm clashed directly against Keeper Everwood’s wooden ruler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible wave of
power struck out at Keeper Everwood’s soul. Keeper Everwood’s
wooden ruler turned sluggish, giving the palm a chance to slip past
it and strike directly against his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood!” Lord
Allfiend’s face twisted. He never would’ve expected that Keeper
Everwood, so skilled in defense, would actually be the first to fall
into danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be able to
escape.” Keeper Everwood quickly understood that he wouldn’t be
able to avoid death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mind became filled
with thoughts of how he had journeyed as a mortal through the
Seamless Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He thought of a wooden
house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood had
played an everwood flute in front of that house as a certain woman
had danced by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wish I
could go back…but I never will…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant palm pierced
straight through Keeper Everwood’s body…but as it did, Keeper
Everwood actually laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body suddenly
exploded. Pierced through by that palm, he had unhesitatingly chosen
to self-detonate. This explosion, the self-detonation of an Elder
God, rocked the entire battlefield. The power of this explosion was
great enough to cause the already-injured Old Man Yuan’s face to
turn even paler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These damn locals.”
Old Man Yuan knew that at a critical time like this, he had to either
kill these Immortals and Fiendgods or be killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He never would’ve
imagined that he would be in such a dangerous situation. It was all
due to that flower!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No…it was all because
of Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it wasn’t for
Houyi, his black lotus formation wouldn’t have been breached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Old Man Yuan
grew even more berserk. This time, he simultaneously struck out with
two of his palms against Daoist Three Purities. Daoist Three
Purities’ ‘Immortal Slaying Swords’ had tremendous penetrative
power. As a result, his attacks were actually the most damaging to
Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoists,
are you willing to accompany me unto death?” Daoist Three Purities
knew that he wouldn’t be able to survive this attack; the defensive
power of his ‘Nuwa Heaven Repairing Formation’ was far lower than
that of an Elder God’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is our honor to
follow you, Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the giant palms came
smashing towards them, Daoist Three Purities and his 3600 True
Immortals all smiled. Then…they transformed into an incomparably
dazzling sun that was even more brilliant than the Solar Star itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve gone ahead
of us, my old friend,” Lord Tathagata murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear I will slay
this Outsider!” Ning’s eyes were filled with crimson bloodlust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amitabha.” Buddha
Jueming was even more berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These damn yokels!”
Old Man Yuan was going crazy from rage as well. Keeper Everwood had
chosen to self-detonate, then Daoist Three Purities and several
thousand True Immortals had chosen to do the same, allowing all of
the Immortal energy in their body to completely burst forth. The
explosive power was simply too great; even Old Man Yuan was injured
by the waves of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die! Die!” Old Man
Yuan then sent three of his palms to strike out towards Ji Ning.
Aside from the Immortal Slaying Swords, Ji Ning’s Triult Swords
were the most dangerous weapons on the battlefield. The two people
Old Man Yuan wanted dead above all others were Ji Ning and Daoist
Three Purities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body was
able to block one palm…but the other two palms continued forward to
strike against Ning’s Primaltwin. The black-robed Primaltwin’s
body was quite weak, after all; he wouldn’t be able to resist any
close range attacks that landed against him. Ning’s true body had
been helping out this entire time, but now that three palms were
simultaneously striking out against him…the only possible result
was death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsider…” The
black-robed Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another dazzling,
enormous sun suddenly lit up.

Chapter 31 - The Destiny of the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the distant
incarnation of Godfiend Witherspike saw those enormous suns erupt one
after the other, even he was moved by the grief he could sense
radiating from them. Some of his most ancient memories were stirred,
and he couldn’t help but sigh softly, “Even I hope that they can
kill the Mindlord. Perhaps the Mindlord really will end up falling by
the hands of these locals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood, dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
and his 3600 True Immortals, dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji
Ning, dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, you yokels! All
of you, die!” Old Man Yuan was utterly enraged. Even if he won this
battle, his soul would have been so heavily injured that even he
didn’t know how long it would take for it to heal. He sent three of
his enormous arms reaching out towards Lord Tathagata the Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha murmured in
a soft voice, “If I do not go to Hell, who shall? My friends, are
you willing to venture into Hell alongside me?” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am willing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am willing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods by
his side were all extremely calm as the most unforgettable memories
of their lives slowly drifted through their minds. They all had
things they had once sworn to protect, and they would not shirk back
from their duty, not even it cost them their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three enormous
palms descended upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Buddha and his
5800 Empyrean Gods were all completely calm and peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blindingly brilliant
sun erupted once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Lord Tathagata
had an indestructible golden body, he knew very well that he was
still just a True God. If he didn’t self-detonate, Old Man Yuan
would end up suppressing him and then sealing him away. The end
result would still be death, and he wouldn’t even be able to harm
Old Man Yuan! Thus, Lord Buddha didn’t hesitate at all. He
immediately self-detonated, the shock of the explosion causing Old
Man Yuan’s hands to shudder and quickly draw backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s face
turned even uglier to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Old Man
Yuan had already made up his mind to wipe them all out. His next
target was Buddha Jueming. Buddha Jueming’s protective divine
ability was incredibly formidable. Given that he was also an Elder
God…he made Old Man Yuan rather uncomfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amitabha. Northrest,
my benefactor…this monk won’t be able to travel to Vastheaven
Palace.” Buddha Jueming silently murmured these words to himself,
smiling as he watched those three massive palms descend towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming also
transformed into a dazzlingly bright sun, the power of the explosion
furiously draining away Old Man Yuan’s divine power. However, given
that Old Man Yuan was a Heartforce Cultivator, he’d still be able
to survive even if the only part of him left was his truesoul! When
World God Northrest had fled, he had lost both his body and his soul.
The only part of him left was his truesoul, and his truesoul was
actually beginning to dissipate as well. Despite all that, he had
managed to stay alive for a long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Obviously, Old Man Yuan
wasn’t as formidable as Northrest. However, although quite a bit of
his divine power and soul had been consumed, he was still able to
continue to launch attacks of tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the difference
between himself and Lord Demonheart. He was one of the Nine Divine
Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still not
dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is he not
dead?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance and the Seamless Gate all felt heartbroken over their
losses, and yet somehow Old Man Yuan was still alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, die.” Old
Man Yuan next sent five of his arms to strike at Ji Ning. Ji Ning’s
true body had mastered the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent], making it
extremely hard for Old Man Yuan to kill him with just one or two
arms. However, Old Man Yuan’s arms were all capable of attacking as
fast as the limits of the Heavenly Daos. When five of those arms
attacked simultaneously, there really was no way for Ji Ning to
dodge, especially since he had been fighting in close combat to begin
with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…Ji Ning
never even considered fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the other major
powers had additional clones like he did, yet they had all decided to
self-detonate in the hopes of exhausting more of Old Man Yuan’s
divine power. Ning had clones. How could he flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, he
threw all other thoughts to the back of his mind. He focused on just
one thing…to injure Old Man Yuan as best he could. Perhaps he might
be the straw that broke the camel’s back, causing Old Man Yuan to
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Keeper Everwood had
died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
and his 3600 True Immortals had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Primaltwin Ning had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Tathagata the
Buddha and his 5800 Empyrean Gods had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming had
died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, even Ning’s true
body was going to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow
Daoists…I’m not afraid of death, but I have to ensure that the
Seamless Gate will live on. If all of us were to die here, the
Immortals and Fiendgods who died for our sake would have died for
nothing.” The Lord of All Fiends finally decided to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re leaving the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
began to collect the major powers of the Seamless Gate mid-battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this Endwar had
begun, these major powers had all handed their closest friends and
loved ones over to the Lord of All Fiends for safekeeping. They all
had faith in the escaping abilities of the Lord of All Fiends. The
reason why they were willing to risk or even to give up their lives
was to ensure that the ones they cared about would be able to
continue living.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. All of
you, let’s go.” Subhuti appeared next to the major powers of the
Nuwa Alliance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Sun
Wukong’s eyes turned red, as did the eyes of many others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood
that continuing to fight like this would be pointless. The whole
point of them fighting was to keep the soulslaves occupied,
preventing them from assisting Old Man Yuan! Now, however, there was
no point. It was all up to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These other True Gods
and Daofathers were too weak to make a difference; they simply
couldn’t keep Old Man Yuan tied down. If Old Man Yuan wanted to
flee, he could do so whenever he wished to. Only the likes of Ji
Ning, the Lord of All Fiends, and the other overlords were capable of
forcing Old Man Yuan to stay and fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
evacuated the Seamless Gate, while Subhuti evacuated the Nuwa
Alliance. Both sides had already made their preparations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning’s
self-detonation failed to slay Old Man Yuan, then they would leave
the Three Realms and enter the endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning’s
self-detonation succeeded in exhausting Old Man Yuan’s store of
divine power, rendering him helpless…then they would counter-attack
and win!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all up to Ji
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those five massive
palms reached out for Ning from five different directions, covering
the Void like five massive stormclouds. All of them moved as fast as
the speed of light, giving Ning’s true body no chance to run.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the Three Realms
about to be destroyed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have a
slight chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was calmer than he
ever had been before. The reason why all of those overlords had
sacrificed themselves was because they saw that same slight chance as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.”
Ning’s heart was as still as water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Old Man Yuan’s five palms slammed down with no mercy
whatsoever towards Ning’s true body. With the Lord of All Fiends
having fled, the Three Realms no longer posed any threat to him
whatsoever. As for the likes of Buddha Maitreya or Sun Wukong, those
major powers were too weak in comparison. If he wanted to fight them,
he would; if he wanted to flee from them, he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was the last
one who could pose a threat to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, then.” Old
Man Yuan’s eyes were filled with cold savagery as he mentally
steeled himself for Ji Ning’s self-detonation. “I can take
another blast. I can still hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
had fled far off into the distance and was watching through his
senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti was
also far away by now, and by his side stood Buddha Maitreya, Buddha
Amitabha, Sun Wukong, Jade Cauldron, and the others. They, too, were
watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation was also watching from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The destiny of the
Three Realms itself hung in the balance, and everyone was waiting to
see how the scales would be tipped. Even the Heavenly Daos were
shuddering. They understood that a critical moment had arrived…but
there was nothing they could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the countless
living creatures of the Three Realms, they continued to peacefully
live their ordinary lives. Some struggled for political power, some
wooed their lovers, some chanted poems, some focused on their
studies, and some were fighting in their own wars…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had no idea…that
the fate of the entire Three Realms would be decided in this next
instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…What’s going
on?” The Lord of All Fiends, Patriarch Subhuti, Godfiend
Witherspike, and the others all grew puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Old
Man Yuan’s giant palms had descended upon Ji Ning, clutching him in
their grasp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no
detonation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t
self-detonate?!” The Lord of All Fiends boggled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti and the rest of
the Nuwa Alliance were all stunned as well. Even Godfiend
Witherspike’s incarnation was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them believed
that this was because Ji Ning was afraid to die. Ji Ning had to know
that if Old Man Yuan captured him and sealed him away, the end result
would still be death, and a pointless one at that. He wouldn’t even
be able to injure Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were shocked. Old
Man Yuan himself was shocked. He had already mentally prepared
himself to deal with Ji Ning’s self-detonation, but even as he
finally wrapped his fingers around Ji Ning, Ji Ning still did not
self-detonate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The destiny of the
Three Realms shall be decided in this instant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning saw the palms
draw near him, he had decided to self-detonate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, his
heart was calmer than it ever had been before. He stood there all by
himself, his friends and allies all far away, his spirit in a state
of complete silence…and suddenly, he found that spark of insight
within his divine body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A spark of insight
that can only be found in endless solitude…” As death descended,
Ning suddenly gave up his plans of self-detonation. Instead, he
immediately activated the [Solitary World God] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to advance
through the [Solitary World God], one had to find a spark of insight
hidden within one’s divine body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, when he had
broken through to become a True God, he had succeeded because of the
effort he had spent on mastering the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens.
This time, however, it was because in this moment where the entire
destiny of the Three Realms hung in the balance, his soul had become
so extraordinarily calm and silent that he was able to sense that
tiny little spark inside himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Old Man Yuan’s
fingers clenched around Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning did not
self-detonate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.” The
Lord of All Fiends shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finished.”
The major powers of the Nuwa Alliance all shook their heads, despair
written plainly on their faces. They had tried so hard…but for some
reason, Ji Ning had refused to self-detonate. The last hope of the
Three Realms was gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Patriarch
Subhuti continued to watch. He wouldn’t believe it. He refused to
believe that his disciple was a craven man who feared death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boundless amounts of
chaos energy suddenly began to appear in a great flood, forming an
enormous chaos vortex that was centered…directly above Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not finished.
The Three Realms isn’t finished.” When Subhuti saw the chaos
vortex suddenly appear, he let out a hoarse cry. “The Three Realms
is not finished!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. This is a very
famous Buddhist saying which was actually attributed to Bodhisattva
Kshitigarbha, who swore that he would not allow himself to become a
Buddha until he rescued all living things who were trapped in Hell.
When asked by others why he was doing this, he countered with the
question, ‘If I do not go to hell (to rescue those people), who
shall?”  ↩

Chapter 32 - Half-Step World God
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends,
the major powers of the Nuwa Alliance, and Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation all stared at the chaos vortex which had suddenly
appeared. All of them tensed as they sensed that aura of tremendous
power expand and wash over them. The source of that terrifying
aura…lay in the center of Old Man Yuan’s giant palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. This is
impossible.” Old Man Yuan was still seated on his lotus throne, but
his face now completely changed. He could keenly sense the terrifying
power emanating from Ji Ning, who he still held within his grasp.
Clearly, Ji Ning was striving to push him back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He made a
breakthrough?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had
experienced the war that ended the Primordial Era. It was at the very
end of that war when Mother Nuwa had broken through to become a World
God, absorbing enormous amounts of chaos energy and then dominating
all her foes. For a chaos vortex to appear at a moment like this…Old
Man Yuan knew right away that Ji Ning had begun to make a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…Ji Ning had only
trained for roughly a thousand years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s barely a
thousand years old. There’s no way he could possibly become a World
God so quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And judging from the
size of this chaos vortex, it doesn’t appear as though he has
become a World God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as he isn’t
a World God, he still won’t be a match for me.” Old Man Yuan had
been heavily wounded. He knew that this was a critical moment, and he
truly did not wish to lose. To lose meant dying in the hands of these
local yokels, and so he repeatedly consoled himself by telling
himself he would win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get over here!”
Old Man Yuan sought to tighten his grip around Ning and pull him
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
manifested three heads and six arms. His six arms trembled violently,
but he was still able to push Old Man Yuan’s palms aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast flood of chaos
energy continued to pour into Ji Ning’s body. Ji Ning’s divine
body was continuously improving and transforming as his True God
power was rapidly converted into Elder God power. This caused his
aura to continue to grow in power, allowing him to fight back with
greater and greater efficacy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” This time,
Old Man Yuan struck out with all six of his massive palms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BOOM! BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to block
and occasionally counter-attack. Only part of his mind was on the
fight; most of his efforts were directed towards converting his
divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body continued to
grow more and more powerful…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be? How
can he be this strong? Even if he has become an Elder God, it doesn’t
make sense for him to become this strong.” Old Man Yuan grew
frantic. The amount of power which Ji Ning had revealed already
surpassed that which an Elder God should be capable of. Old Man
Yuan’s six arms were now completely incapable of suppressing Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, Old Man Yuan
had no idea that Ji Ning had trained in both the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] and the [One True Body] divine abilities. Upon becoming an
Elder God, Ning would be as strong as seventeen Elder Gods added
together. This was even more effective than seventeen Elder Gods
joining together into a formation; he could be considered a half-step
World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan couldn’t
be blamed for his miscalculation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This combination of
techniques was extremely rare, even amongst Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals. Less than one in ten thousand would be at such a level of
power. The King of Pangaea himself had only risen to prominence
amongst Elder Gods after he had mastered the third level of the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], which allowed him to fuse all eighteen of
his bodies together. When he later became a World God, he became an
incredibly powerful one thanks to his enormously strong and stable
foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan can no
longer hold him down.” The Lord of All Fiends revealed a look of
joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can’t hold
Darknorth down any longer.” Buddha Maitreya and the others began to
grow excited as well. Why had so many major powers, Immortals, and
Fiendgods sacrificed their lives earlier? It was all for the sake of
defeating this alien Outsider and defending their Three Realms.
Now…they could see hope!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to win. You
HAVE to win!” Patriarch Subhuti grew excited as well, his body
beginning to visibly tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die! Die! DIE!”
Old Man Yuan’s six arms struck out at Ji Ning with wild, berserk
abandon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flood of chaos
energy continued to pour into Ning’s body, causing even more of his
True God power to be converted into Elder God power. By now, more
than seventy percent of the divine power in his body was Elder God
power, and the rest was still being converted. He was now so strong
that his punches and kicks were enough to completely block Old Man
Yuan’s attacks. In terms of raw power alone, he had definitely
surpassed Old Man Yuan already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A half-step World
God…unless a true World God made an appearance, a half-step World
God could be described as capable of utterly dominating all
opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this
happen? How could he be this strong? What the hell type of divine
abilities and secret arts has he trained in?” Old Man Yuan was
beginning to panic. “I need to leave, now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no time for
slow pondering. Old Man Yuan immediately chose to flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As one of the Nine
Divine Generals, he was an extremely crafty figure. He knew very well
that given how Ji Ning had learned the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent],
it would be extremely difficult for him to flee. This was one of the
reasons why he hadn’t tried to leave earlier and had instead
focused on attempting to wipe out the experts of the Three Realms.
Now, his plan was to take advantage of the fact that Ji Ning was
making a breakthrough and use the remaining time to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Old Man Yuan
immediately began to flee at high speed atop his black lotus, and as
he did so he gave orders to his many soulslaves. “Stop Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to run?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was continuing
to convert his divine power, but he immediately transformed into a
streak of black lightning and chased after Old Man Yuan. Although his
divine power was not yet fully converted, and although combat would
slow down the breakthrough process, that wouldn’t make much of a
difference. When Mother Nuwa had made her breakthrough to become a
World God, she had caused an even greater disturbance and needed to
convert even more divine power, but she was still able to dominate
all her foes during the process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The black
lightning serpent flashed forward through the Void, easily dodging
past the other major powers and chasing after Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Old Man
Yuan felt hatred and regret. He had made so many preparations and
backup plans, and he had even managed to avoid exposing himself
during the war that had ended the Primordial Era after seeing Mother
Nuwa make her breakthrough. This time, he had only chosen to reveal
his true self after Lord Demonheart had died and the two alliances
had come to a ceasefire…but then he ended up running into this
monster, Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was a monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was a monster
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi had slain Lord
Demonheart and breached the first black lotus formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong’s Lifeseizer
Flower had heavily injured him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The self-detonations of
the various major powers had depleted the majority of Old Man Yuan’s
divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given all of my
abilities, if I was at peak power I wouldn’t be afraid to battle
this Ji Ning head-on. But…this body is a body that I took over
through possession. It is too slow!” Old Man Yuan shook his head.
He wasn’t even able to fly as fast as the speed of light; there was
no way he would be able to escape. And, unlike Subhuti, he didn’t
have any techniques that allowed him to flee to a different spacetime
continuum. His only choice was to face Ji Ning head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus Guard.”
Old Man Yuan sat down in the lotus position once more, the black
lotus flowers once more circling around him and covering an area of
ten thousand kilometers. The lotus petals began to swivel in place as
he stared icily at the white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
in the Void, his aura continuing to grow more and more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninety percent. A
hundred percent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chaos vortex above
him finally began to vanish. Ji Ning looked at Old Man Yuan, his eyes
filled with a terrible, terrifying light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsider…today is
the day you die.” Ning’s body blurred briefly as he manifested
his three heads and six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A yokel like you
dares to put on airs in front of me?” Old Man Yuan sat there atop
his black lotus throne as he replied in a cold voice. “I might be
heavily wounded, but if I have to fight to the death I can still kill
a bumpkin like you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning let out an
angry snort. His six arms instantly stretched out through the Void,
expanding many tens of thousands of kilometers as they simultaneously
struck out towards Old Man Yuan’s black lotus flowers. Ning’s six
mighty arms were like six enormous axes, and he furiously chopped
down upon the black lotus flowers with power comparable to Pangu’s
when Pangu cleaved apart Heaven from Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine
ability…[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep dreaming.”
Old Man Yuan felt complete confidence in himself. The Blacklotus
Guard was a secret art of God Emperor Blacklotus. It possessed
incredible defensive strength and was so durable that the
simultaneous attacks of Ji Ning, Daoist Three Purities, the Lord of
All Fiends, and Keeper Everwood had been able to do nothing to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six massive explosions
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black lotus flowers
surrounding him shuddered violently. Even his lotus throne shuddered,
and quite a few of the lotus petals began to crack apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Old Man
Yuan was shocked. How was this possible? He had been personally
taught this technique by the God Emperor. Even supreme Elder Gods
should find it difficult to breach this technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning actually
frowned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew better than
anyone else how shockingly powerful he had become. He was now a
half-step World God, and his six palms were all comparable to Chaos
weapons. His skills in sword-arts were incredibly high, and when he
used the ‘Heavenbreaker stance’ to strike his blows definitely
possessed the power of a supreme Elder god. He had also used the
[Starseizing Hand], making his blows more powerful than even Lord
Demonheart’s had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had struck out with
six palms at the same time…and yet, the black lotus flowers hadn’t
completely shattered?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you. Today is
the day you die.” Ning retracted three of his six arms, then
manifested a blood-red sword within one of them - Violetjewel. Ning’s
eyes were filled with murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t use
Violetjewel and instead used brute force strikes, he would probably
still be able to eventually break apart the Blacklotus Guard or to
completely exhaust Old Man Yuan’s divine power and then kill
him…but Ning felt far too much hatred towards Old Man Yuan. He
wasn’t willing to wait, and so he immediately took out the most
powerful weapon he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A half-step World God
body…a supreme sword-art…the [Starseizing Hand]…and
Violetjewel, a weapon that was comparable to a Dao weapon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s power had
already crossed the threshold of a World God’s power.
</P>

Chapter 33 - Curtain Call
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sword?” When Old
Man Yuan saw Ji Ning pull out a sword, he gritted his teeth. “My
black lotus is incredibly tough and durable. It’s perfect against
swords and sabers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
took a step forward, his body rapidly expanding in size to become
thirty thousand kilometers in height, comparable to the size of the
black lotuses. He then lifted up the similarly enormous Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall break for
me!” Ning raised Violetjewel up high, filling it with a savage
torrent of divine power that passed through the sword’s
quintessence and made it even more powerful. The towering Ning held
Violetjewel high in the air, then furiously chopped down towards the
protective black lotus in front of him. The anger infused into this
chop made it even more savage than any of his previous strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wasn’t even
able to breach my defenses when using all six arms. Now, with just a
single sword…” Old Man Yuan smiled coldly as he took firm control
over his Blacklotus Guard…but then, his cold smile turned stiff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like the Heavens
had collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that the
blow connected with the black lotus flowers, the flowers completely
folded under its power. Countless lotus petals were instantly torn
apart, causing the entire black lotus to begin to break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao weapon.” Old
Man Yuan stared as Ning struck out with Violetjewel. “Is that a Dao
weapon? It has to be a Dao weapon. Otherwise, there’s no way it
could be so powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many grades
of magic weapons. Above Chaos weapons was the realm of Dao weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, Dao
weapons were exclusively used by World Gods and Chaos Immortals. It
was almost impossibly rare for an Elder God or an Ancestral Immortal
to be lucky enough to acquire one! A weakling simply wouldn’t be
able to keep his hands on a Dao weapon for long, and in truth Ji Ning
wasn’t strong enough either. Previously, when he filled it with his
True God power, it had still been so weak that his strikes weren’t
particularly impressive. Not even experienced figures like
Witherspike or Old Man Yuan had suspected that his weapon was a Dao
weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that his divine
power had become dramatically stronger, the power of his weapon also
became much more apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Triult Swords or
the Immortal Slaying Swords, for example, could be said to have just
barely surpassed Chaos weapons in might; they could be considered to
have nearly reached the level of Dao weapons. However, they were only
comparable to the weakest of Dao weapons; there was still a
noticeable difference between them and true Dao weapons. Now that
Ning had become a half-step World God, his divine power was capable
of truly linking to and activating the core quintessence of the
sword, allowing it to reveal its true might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only the most supreme of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would be
qualified to even dream of possessing a Dao weapon. They would
furiously battle for the right to wield such a weapon, and only the
most powerful of them would ever be able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without a Dao weapon,
Ning would at most be considered a supreme Elder God and be just
slightly more powerful than Lord Demonheart. They would still,
however, belong to the same general level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With this Dao weapon,
he had truly reached the World God threshold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” After Ning
broke apart the black lotuses, he returned to his normal shape and
size as he transformed into a black lightning serpent that streaked
towards Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I kill you,
your Dao weapon shall be mine.” A look of greed was in Old Man
Yuan’s eyes. “Time to go all out. I have no way out anyhow. My
only option is to use my heartforce in a last-ditch attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Endwar, he
hadn’t tried to use his heartforce to attack Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because he had
discovered during his previous ambush attempt that Ji Ning’s soul
protection technique was extremely formidable. He simply didn’t
feel confident in using heartforce against Ji Ning…but now, he had
no other options. Use divine power? He had almost run out, and thanks
to the Dao weapon Ji Ning had just barely reached the World God
threshold of power. Old Man Yuan’s only shot, his final shot, was
to use heartforce in one last attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning charged
towards him, Violetjewel in hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan sat there
in the lotus position, striking out with his six arms to block Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
chopped out with his sword once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan was
knocked flying backwards, his hands aching and starting to split
apart. He couldn’t help but feel shocked by this. “With this Dao
weapon in hand…in offensive power, at least, Ji Ning is as powerful
as a World God. My body is comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic
treasure, but it is at the verge of breaking down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A true World God would
be able to effortless smash apart any top-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasure…and Ji Ning was already strong enough to cause
damage to such treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Old Man Yuan used his palms to block Ning’s repeated attacks.
Although he was sent flying backwards each time, his defenses
remained utterly airtight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at Old Man
Yuan as the latter struck out repeatedly, six arms moving like a
blur. He felt a greater desire to kill this man than he had ever felt
before, and the future of all living creatures of the Three Realms
was riding on his shoulders. Ning felt calmer and more zen-like than
he ever had before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years, he had
mastered the ninety-eight stone sword-steles which World God
Northrest had left behind, but he had never been able to gain
proficiency in the [Nameless] sword-art. However, as he stared at Old
Man Yuan’s six illusory arms, a light suddenly flashed in Ning’s
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a very strange
feeling…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
surrounding Void had become part of his own demesnes, as though the
Void itself had become brimming with sword-intent. It was as though
countless swords were resonating with him and were calling out with
joy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is my
world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt a sense of
total and utter control. In this moment, Ning suddenly understood the
true meaning of the first stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the
‘Heartsword’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Heartsword’
stance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t meant to
make his sword stronger! It wasn’t meant to make his sword faster!
On the surface, it seemed as though it wouldn’t make Ning’s sword
attacks better in any measurable way, but in reality…the true
meaning of the ‘Heartsword’ stance lay in truly understanding how
to use and control the sword. It taught the wielder how to become the
true master of his sword, allowing him to truly unleash the
appropriate amount of power with every single strike. It taught one
to be agile when necessary, strike with full force when necessary,
block when necessary…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a sense of
control that one would only possess when one reached a truly profound
level of insight into the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartsword Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at Old Man
Yuan’s six illusory palms, then strode forward through the Void and
struck out with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The sword
knocked one palm aside, causing an opening to appear in the movements
of the other five palms. In the past, Ning would have never been able
to notice such a minute flaw…but he now had a sort of absolute
control over the Void around him, making it almost impossible for any
flaw to escape his notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He struck out with
three consecutive sword-strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan didn’t
even have a chance to react before Ning’s sword-light pierced
through his six blocking arms, stabbing straight towards his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this…”
Old Man Yuan was in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even an ordinary Elder
God who had mastered the first stance of the [Nameless] sword-art,
the ‘Heartsword’ stance, would become comparable to a supreme
Elder God in battle. This stance represented a certain level of
mastery over the sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with impending
doom, Old Man Yuan didn’t attempt to block the sword-strike. In
truth, there was no way for him to block it, even if he wanted to…and
so all he did was stare into Ji Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple of power
instantly surged towards Ning and attacked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as if a gray
seed suddenly burrowed itself into Ning’s body, attempting to
penetrate his very soul. This gray mental seed caused Ning to feel a
dim sense of danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce soul-lock!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he became a
half-step World God, he had hurriedly strengthened his soul and once
more protected it with the heartforce soul-lock technique which World
God Northrest had transmitted to him. It was as though an
incomparably thick steel plate had appeared before the gray seed. The
gray seed did its best to burrow through it, but it actually began to
shatter after repeatedly ramming into the steel plate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stab!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
didn’t slow down in the slightest as it pierced straight through
Old Man Yuan’s forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s
fastest and most penetrating attack. Old Man Yuan’s protective
divine ability was unable to block this strike. His forehead was
pierced straight through…and he finally ran out of divine power. As
Violetjewel unleashed its power, Old Man Yuan’s truesoul was
completely ground apart and destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan…had
died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void was completely
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s body
continued to sit there in the lotus position, with Ji Ning standing
in front of him, holding a sword that had been driven through his
forehead. Old Man Yuan’s life aura had completely dissipated…but
on his face was a look of resentment and unwillingness to accept this
outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, his final
attempt at a heartforce attack had also been easily blocked by Ning.
This made him feel quite resentful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tears appeared in the
eyes of the Lord of All Fiends as he beheld this sight. He murmured
softly to himself, “Everwood, we won. The Three Realms won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the Nuwa Alliance’s
side, Patriarch Subhuti, Buddha Maitreya, Sun Wukong, Jade Cauldron,
Kuafu, and the other major powers stared hard as well, afraid that
they were seeing things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead. Old Man Yuan
is finally dead.” Daoist Jade Cauldron mumbled to himself, “Master,
the Three Realms has been saved. It’s saved. We won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won.” Sun
Wukong murmured softly, “My senior apprentice-brothers and junior
apprentice-brothers…we won. Do you know? We won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A number of major
powers couldn’t help but begin to shed tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had
won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the distant
incarnation Godfiend Witherspike found itself breathless. When he saw
Ji Ning pierce through Old Man Yuan’s forehead with his sword, he
waited for Old Man Yuan’s life aura to completely vanish before he
mumbled to himself, “I never would’ve thought that the Mindlord
of the Nine Divine Generals would end up dying in the hands of a
local bumpkin from this chaosworld. These yokels actually won. This
is unbelievable. Truly unbelievable.”

Violetjewel out of Old Man Yuan’s corpse. His body was comparable
to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure; destroying it would be no
easy feat. Ning would have to attack multiple times at absolute
maximum power in order to succeed. Still, Ning couldn’t actually be
bothered to do that; he would simply use his Five Elements Cauldron
to annihilate the body of this alien Outsider who had sinned against
them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wouldn’t even
make use of the Five Elements essence from this body, because he
viewed it to be filthy! Ning truly felt far too much hatred towards
Old Man Yuan, because far too many had died because of him. Many of
Ning’s old friends, his fellow apprentices, and even overlords had
died because of him. All the waters of the universe still wouldn’t
be enough to wash away the hatred he felt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Subhuti,
Buddha Maitreya, Daoist Jade Cauldron, Kuafu, and the other major
powers flew over. The Lord of All Fiends, Daofather Bloodswan, and
the other major powers of the Seamless Gate flew over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He finally died.”
Subhuti stared at Old Man Yuan’s corpse, then said in a low voice,
“This alien Outsider has finally died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the most
terrifying Outsider I have ever encountered.” The Lord of All
Fiends let out a sigh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms’
tribulation has finally come to an end.” Buddha Amitabha had a look
of grief and sorrow in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An end?” A voice
suddenly rang out from afar. “Don’t be so quick to celebrate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the major powers
surrounding Old Man Yuan’s corpse turned to look. They saw Godfiend
Witherspike fly towards them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godfiend
Witherspike?” The Lord of All Fiends frowned. “No, this is just
his incarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
could also tell that this was merely Witherspike’s incarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witherspike, what do
you mean by that?” The Lord of All Fiends frowned. “Are you
scheming something?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flicker of a killing
intent flashed through Ji Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation glanced at Ning, then laughed. “Sword Immortal
Darknorth definitely stands at the very peak of power amongst Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals. How would I dare to scheme against
him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why would you
suggest that the tribulation has not ended?” Ning frowned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t say that.
I just said…don’t be so quick to celebrate.” Godfiend
Witherspike’s incarnation side. “To tell you the truth, all of
you have to thank me. I truly feel sympathy for you locals, after
having seen you all fight so hard to protect your Three Realms. As
for the Mindlord, I really rather dislike the man. That’s why I’ve
come to tell you a few things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mindlord?” Ning
and the others listened, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan had an
extraordinary background,” Godfiend Witherspike’s incarnation
said. “He is one of the Nine Divine Generals of God Emperor
Blacklotus, whose name is spoken of with awe throughout the entire
Badlands Territory. God Emperor Blacklotus is a World God, while his
Nine Divine Generals are his nine most trusted subordinates, each of
whom is a supreme Elder God or Ancestral Immortal. Every single one
of them is more powerful than Lord Demonheart was, while Old Man Yuan
was the ‘Mindlord’ of the nine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
frowned upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the territory
that was closest to the Three Realms. Once one traversed through that
spatial vortex that led outside the Three Realms, one would reach the
vast region commanded by the Badlands Everworld which was known as
the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how
powerful he was, he’s dead now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Godfiend
Witherspike shook his head. “I only reached this place during the
Three Realms Era, while the Mindlord arrived here during the
Primordial Era…but what’s strange is that when I was in the
Badlands Territory, I actually saw the Mindlord once from afar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You saw the Mindlord
in the Badlands Territory during the Three Realms Era?” The faces
of Ji Ning and everyone else all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan had
arrived during the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could the Mindlord
have been present in the Badlands Territory during the Three Realms
Era?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Godfiend
Witherspike nodded. “As you’ve probably guessed by now, the
Mindlord rose to power step-by-step, starting as an ordinary mortal.
He has a Primaltwin! His true body has been following and serving God
Emperor Blacklotus this entire time, while his Primaltwin has
generally been the body he used to wage war. My guess is that the
‘him’ that died here was nothing more than his Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He still has a true
body?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of the
Three Realms were all enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But why is it that
all of his soulslaves died as well?” Ning pointed towards the
corpses of the major powers that were floating through the Void. As
soon as Old Man Yuan had died, all of his soulslaves had silently
passed away as well. “If he has a true body…his true body and his
Primaltwin should share the same soul. Both would be capable of
controlling his soulslaves. When his Primaltwin died, the soulslaves
should remain alive, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spot on.” Godfiend
Witherspike’s incarnation sighed. “Logically speaking, after he
died he should’ve immediately ordered his soulslaves to attack you,
trying to do as much damage as he possibly could, regardless of the
price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And yet…he did
not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Instead, when he
died he willed all of his soulslaves to die as well.” Godfiend
Witherspike’s incarnation smiled. “That’s because he didn’t
want you to realize that he still had a true body around.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t want us
to know?” The major powers of the Three Realms began to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation glanced at Ning, then let out a sigh. “Sword Immortal
Darknorth…you’ve started to frighten the Mindlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Frighten?” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. You are
starting to scare him.” Godfiend Witherspike continued, “Because
of what Old Man Yuan, the Three Realms has suffered far, far too
much. I trust that all of you here would be willing to do almost
anything to tear him apart, dining on his flesh and drinking his
blood. If you all knew that he had a true body out there…it’s
entirely possible that you would choose to venture out into the
Badlands Territory to seek revenge upon him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you have
remained within just this single chaosworld, with no one to provide
you with any guidance…and yet, you all have still managed to train
to such levels of power. This is even more true for you, Sword
Immortal Darknorth…you are already ridiculously strong, and your
sword-arts are particularly terrifying. Very few Elder Gods or
Ancestral Immortals would be a match for you. In fact, not even the
Mindlord’s true body would necessarily be a match for you! And
you’ve only trained for a bit over a thousand years…given your
potential, it is entirely possible that you might become a World
God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you were to seek
him out in the future for the sake of revenge…you tell me, wouldn’t
the Mindlord be worried? Wouldn’t he be frightened by this
possibility?” Godfiend Witherspike’s incarnation smiled. “If
you were to perpetually remain at your current level of power, he
wouldn’t be worried; he’s protected by God Emperor Blacklotus
after all. But you’ve been improving far too quickly. He can’t
help but feel afraid…and so, in the moment of his death, he
extinguished the souls of all his soulslaves, putting on a show of
being truly slain. This was all for the sake of deceiving you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense. Even if
Old Man Yuan had ordered his soulslaves to launch an all-out assault,
Ning would’ve been able to effortlessly wipe them all out. Far
better to use them to deceive Ning instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…well, I’ve
said everything I’ve come to say.” Godfiend Witherspike’s
incarnation smiled. “No need to thank me. Ahahaha…great men like
the Mindlord have always looked down on minor figures like us. I’m
delighted that I’m able to ruin things for him!” As he laughed,
his incarnation slowly dissipated and faded away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, at the very
end of the Three Realms. A dark-golden castle was hovering in the
Void here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mindlord…hmph. You
wanted to make a clean break and avoid any future troubles? A pity
for you that I’ve stirred up the trouble you wanted to avoid.”
Godfiend Witherspike laughed coldly. ‘Old Man Yuan’ truly had put
on a perfect show; Ji Ning and the others had no idea that ‘Old Man
Yuan’ still had a true body outside the Three Realms, much less
what his true identity was. It really would’ve been difficult for
them to take revenge on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…Godfiend
Witherspike had told them everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, did you just
say that Ji Ning slew the Mindlord?” Saber was shocked. “Is Ji
Ning really that powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is.”
Godfiend Witherspike thought back to that final clash, when Ji Ning’s
terrible sword-art had easily pierced through Old Man Yuan’s palms.
The power of the ‘Heartsword’ stance had truly frightened the
Godfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Heartsword’
stance was a technical stance. Ji Ning was now a half-step World God,
and his body was filled with incredible power. An incredible
technique, matched with incredible power…and a Dao weapon as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of all the Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals I’ve ever seen, he can rank in the top
three.” Godfiend Witherspike sighed softly. The reason he said this
was because he had seen how terrifyingly brilliant Ji Ning’s final
sword-art had been. If Ji Ning merely relied on powerful divine
abilities and his Dao weapon, he would be nothing more than a stronge
brute…but the Heartsword stance had truly allowed him to unleash
his power in a perfect manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that
powerful?!” Saber was truly shocked now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke?
Godfiend Witherspike had been alive for ages now, and had seen more
than a hundred individuals on the same level as the Mindlord. Despite
all that, he actually dared to claim that Ji Ning could rank in the
top three?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. To be
able to watch as two figures of such power battled to the death…this
entire trip was worth it.” Godfiend Witherspike no longer harbored
any more designs on the Three Realms at all. His dark-golden castle
flew out of the Void, entering the endless primordial chaos and once
more beginning their drifting journey through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After listening to
Godfiend Witherspike’s words, Ning had a feeling that the man had
told them the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Old
Man Yuan had once said this to Witherspike: “Witherspike, do you
still remember that black lotus?” When Witherspike had heard those
words, he had been so terrified that he immediately fled. The ‘black
lotus secret art’ which Old Man Yuan had used had also been truly
formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan?
Mindlord?” A killing intent arose once more within Ning’s breast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to venture
into the endless primordial chaos eventually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All signs pointed to
Old Man Yuan being the Mindlord; Ning assessed that there was at
least an 80% chance of this being the case. After Ning ventured off
into the Badlands Territory, he would probably be able to quickly
verify whether or not this was the case. A technique as powerful as
that black lotus art had to be quite famous. Not just anyone could be
allowed to learn it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…can the
Seamless Gate rejoin the Three Realms once more?” The Lord of All
Fiends suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_35___The_New_Three_Realm"></A>
Chapter 35 - The New Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance all changed slightly. Suhbuti, Maitreya,
Jade Cauldron, Kuafu, Sun Wukong, and the others all hesitated before
answering. They wanted to refuse…but just now, both alliances had
worked together to defeat Old Man Yuan. Keeper Everwood had gone so
far as to unhesitatingly sacrifice his own life by detonating his own
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance had been very close to Everwood. Subhuti
and the already-deceased Tathagata and Three Purities…they had all
been very good friends with Keeper Everwood. For them to expel the
Seamless Gate right after Keeper Everwood had died for the Three
Realms…it really wasn’t very appropriate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they felt
confident that the Lord of All Fiends wasn’t a warmonger, who could
say what the future would hold? When the Seamless Gate gave birth to
new overlords in the future, who could say what would happen? If the
Seamless Gate was permitted to stay in the Three Realms, they would
continue to be a potential source of trouble. It was entirely
possible that in the future, a new war would once more erupt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what do
you think?” Buddha Maitreya spoke out, causing all the major powers
present to look towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was now the
unquestionably most powerful expert of the Three Realms. He now had
the power to dominate all others, much like Mother Nuwa before him.
This meant that his words now held much more weight than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They can rejoin the
Three Realms.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Subhuti and
the others stared towards Ning in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of All Fiends
and the others were all shocked and overjoyed. For the Lord of All
Fiends to venture through the dangers of the primordial chaos was one
thing, but the other major powers and the Seamless Gate’s Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals were far too weak. Life in the Three Realms
would be better by far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…you all
must swear lifeblood oaths.” Ning waved his hand, producing a jade
globe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A lifeblood oath?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The major powers of
both sides looked towards the jade globe in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that an
oathstone?” The Lord of All Fiends was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ji Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then today, the
troubles of the Three Realms shall all come to an end.” The Lord of
All Fiends laughed. Why was it that the various organizations of the
vast primordial chaos were able to remain so unified? It was because
of lifeblood oaths! Even the most durable of faiths and promises
could be slowly worn away by the passage of time, after all. Only the
compulsive power of lifeblood oaths was truly eternal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right there in the
Void, before the corpse of Old Man Yuan, the major powers of the two
alliances set down and swore the Three Realms Oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all of the major
powers finished swearing their lifeblood oaths, the atmosphere
between the two alliances immediately became noticeably friendlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Subhuti
pointed at the corpses of the major powers that were floating around
in the Void. “We can’t just let their corpses continue to float
around like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I think…Holyflame.”
Subhuti turned his head to look at Daofather Holyflame. “Let us
cremate them and send them to their final rest, never to be disturbed
again. Allfiend, what do you say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The Lord
of All Fiends nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
corpses of major powers wouldn’t be buried. The concern was that
some might plunder their graves or perhaps even go so far as to
refine their corpses into treasures. For example, when the Three
Realms slew the alien Outsider known as Rahu, they had used his
corpse to create multiple different treasures such as the Rahu Bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Holyflame
nodded, then waved a finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling, sacred
white flame suddenly flew out from his finger. This was the holy
flame which Daofather Holyflame had devised, a flame that was far
more powerful than the samadhi truefire he had once used. It was
still somewhat weaker than the likes of Golden Solarfire, Zhurong
Godfire, or the Eternal Kindlefire, but since these corpses weren’t
as tough as top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures, his holy flame
was enough to cremate them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corpses of the
Immortals and Fiendgods began to blaze with that pristine, holy white
fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Subhuti,
Allfiend, and the others all watched silently. Their hearts were all
filled with grief. Far, far too many of their friends and brothers
had died on this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life and death are
part of a cycle,” Subhuti said softly. “Although they have died,
the Three Realms shall never forget them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Sovereigns
of Mankind - Suiren, Fuxi, and Shennong…” The Lord of All Fiends
nodded. “Tathagata…Three Purities…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everwood…Jueming…Gonggong…Devilhand…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They will become
legends. The humans…the Buddhists…the Daoists…the Seamless
Gate…the countless living creatures of the world…they shall sing
about them for generations to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the
forefathers, the ones who had ensured that this world of theirs would
survive and prosper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It didn’t matter what
the future held in store for the human race. It didn’t matter that
the Three Realms would eventually collapse and give birth to a new
chaosworld. Hundreds of chaos cycles could go past, but so long as
the human race continued to exist, it would still forever remember
those three ancient Sovereigns who had protected them and guided them
in the earliest, weakest days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although they are
dead, they shall still live forever.” Ji Ning, who had truly fought
shoulder-to-shoulder alongside all of them, felt even more grief than
the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If in the future…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If after a hundred
chaos cycles…a thousand chaos cycles…or an even longer period of
time…if I ever reach the true apex of power possible for
cultivators and become capable of reviving all those who were slain…I
swear that I definitely will do so. I’ll make it so that we’ll
all be able to sit down and drink with each other once more.” Ning
was silently praying to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of his
lifeblood oath, he had to go to Vastheaven Palace. But even if it
wasn’t for the sake of the oath, he still would’ve wanted to
leave and travel to more distant realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps one day, he
would find a technique which would allow an extinguished truesoul to
be brought back to life once more. If he did, he would no longer have
any more regrets in life. He would be able to bring back all those
who had died…but Ning knew quite well how incredibly hard it would
be for him to find and become capable of using such an incredible
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had made up
his mind. No matter how long it took or how hard it would be, he
would continue to go down this path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to this great
war, the Three Realms had lost many of its major powers, Empyrean
Gods, and True Immortals. Its vital essence had been dramatically
weakened, and even the Celestial Court had been shattered by the war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
major powers had worked together to remake a new Celestial Court!
They had re-established the Netherworld Kingdom! They rebuilt the
great Six Paths of Reincarnation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In rebuilding the Six
Paths of Reincarnation, Ji Ning served as the principle power while
Subhuti served as the assistant. This was because the Six Paths of
Reincarnation involved the power of spacetime. Although Ji Ning’s
divine power was the strongest and purest in the Three Realms, he
still needed Subhuti’s help. After three years of hard work, the
Six Paths of Reincarnation were repaired and remade, allowing the
Three Realms to go completely back to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
Immortal cultivators must be extremely restrained and cautious in
choosing disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao is not to be
casually transmitted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A veritable ocean of
Celestial Immortals, True Immortals, Empyrean Gods, and other
cultivators had died as a result of this war. The burden on the Three
Realms was significantly lessened as a result. However, everyone knew
that if the Three Realms continued to produce Immortal cultivators at
as fast a pace as before, it was likely that many new Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals would emerge in the not too distant future. Thus,
certain changes had to be made. Immortal cultivation had to become a
more difficult path, one filled with even more dangers than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the major powers
of the Three Realms gave the orders, the entire Three Realms began to
change. All Immortal cultivation schools were relocated to mountain
tops, and the Immortal cultivation clans and tribes would rarely
admit new disciples. To embark upon the path of Immortal cultivation
would be a hundred times more difficult than it had been in the past.
It required even greater determination and willpower for someone to
be permitted into an Immortal school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred years
passed after the great war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms has
changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man in Daoist
robes was alongside a white-robed youth. The two were standing atop a
cloud, staring at the vast world before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daoist robed elder
let out a sigh. “The Three Realms has become more peaceful as a
whole. Immortal cultivation has become more difficult, which means
that fewer and fewer Immortal cultivators are around to take part in
mortal wars and battles. At most, you’ll only see the occasional
Zifu Disciple taking part. Now that there are so few Immortal
cultivators, there are also much fewer people fighting over resources
and natural treasures, making conflicts amongst cultivators much
rarer than in the past as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ji Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
Three Realms had turned over a new leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you truly going
to leave the Three Realms?” Subhuti looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to leave.”
Ning nodded. “I have no other choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti understood what
Ning was hinting at, knowing that Ning had to be under some sort of
compulsion. “Then what of the Three Realms? Your daughter?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “I’ll
set up an Immortal estate very close to the Three Realms in the
primordial chaos. My Primaltwin will stay there permanently and
protect the Three Realms. My true body will traverse that spatial
vortex and journey to the Badlands Territory. Everything else aside,
the Mindlord remains a source of potential trouble. If I ever have
the chance to kill him, I will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Subhuti
revealed a hint of delight on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For someone was
powerful as Ji Ning, going out adventuring through the primordial
chaos was quite normal. Mother Nuwa was born an Elder God and thus
did not have a Primaltwin. Ji Ning, however, had started an ordinary
mortal and slowly had risen to power. Although he was going to leave,
he would only send his true body out adventuring; his Primaltwin
would remain behind,c lose to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strong is your
Primaltwin, compared to your true body?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With my Primaltwin
here, we wouldn’t need to worry even if we encounter more figures
on the level of Old Man Yuan,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his Primaltwin
was a bit weaker than his true body, it was still a first-tier
Ancestral Immortal. When using the ‘Heartsword stance’, it
absolutely had the power of a supreme Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Subhuti
suddenly glanced downwards and smiled. “See what your daughter is
doing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced downwards
as well, his gaze piercing through the Void. He saw Brightmoon tease
and toy with an ordinary scholar in a mischievious manner. She was
pretending to be an ordinary young lady from a mortal clan of nobles,
and she and her ‘maidservant’ were both teasing this ordinary
mortal scholar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His daughter was able
to live freely within the Three Realms, to be happy and carefree.
Ning was satisfied. In the past, his daughter had been forced to hide
within the Crescent world, and if they had lost the war she would’ve
been forced to risk her life adventuring through the primordial
chaos. Ning truly did not wish to see this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s doing well.
That’s all I want.” Ji Ning smiled.
