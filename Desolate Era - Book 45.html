<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fate
had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Extermination</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
divine sword had pierced through all eight layers of clouds, and so
Ji Ning and the others were able to see everything happening inside
the Grassland World. They couldn’t help but feel shocked by
Iyerre’s might. Bolin’s avatar was newly created and fairly weak,
but for it to be destroyed in just a single blow was insane.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin,
was your avatar actually destroyed?” Autarch Ekong asked, “Even
though you are in control of the Samsara Daobirth Essence, you still
weren’t able to escape?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really was destroyed. Not even a scrap of energy was left,” Bolin
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
even just a shred of his energy had managed to escape, he would have
‘survived’. This was much like how Bolin’s true body had been
almost completely exterminated, but he had managed to survive at the
border between life and death thanks to the Samsara Daobirth Essence.
That tiny shred of life had entered the ‘false death’ state and
hidden itself. Given that Bolin had access to nigh-infinite amounts
of energy, he was able to quickly and soundlessly heal himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
when Iyerre had attacked his avatar didn’t have any chance to
escape at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
become even more powerful,” Autarch Mogg said solemnly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “In this world of grass, his every strike is empowered by
the blue energy of the surrounding area. He has indeed become more
powerful here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Neither
dead nor alive… he’s managed to cut off all karmic links?”
Iyerre had sought to use karma to link his strike and use it to
attack Bolin’s true body, but it had been completely cut off from
all karma and so the attack was unable to proceed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
Iyerre was in a foul mood. His specialty lay in light. Karma? Life
and death? He wasn’t really skilled in either of these two Daos. As
an Omega Autarch his insights into the Dao of Life and Death
surpassed Bolin’s Samsara Daobirth Essence by just a hair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for destroying Bolin’s avatar? It made no difference at all,
because the avatar was a new one. To destroy a peak avatar that took
many years to strengthen would’ve been a resounding success, but a
new avatar… Autarch Bolin would be able to recreate it in a
twinkling!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you won’t come in, I’ll come for you!” Iyerre reached out with
both hands. Whoosh! Whoosh! One enormous violet-gold chain after
another began to clatter, their very auras transforming as they
soared into the heavens. They seemed to transform into inviolable
parts of heaven and earth which nothing could sunder. Moments later,
their bodies began to glow with white light, and as they lashed out
against the giant black serpent they seemed to represent the
punishment of the supreme heavens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
Bang! Bang! The fish-like sword-light in front of the black serpent
sought to block for it, but the violet-gold chains cracked them all
apart. There was no way to defend at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good. These chains just became even more powerful, far more powerful
than they were previously. Our Karmic Wurm isn’t going to be able
to withstand this.” Ning and the others were all shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The enormous sword quickly shrank in size as it flew closer towards
the giant black serpent, seeking to reinforce it. Inside the giant
black serpent were their avatars, after all, and some of those avatar
were at peak strength. There was no way Ning and the others wished to
lose them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the divine sword flew over to reinforce the snake, the snake quickly
retreated and attempted to flee. However, five more violet-gold
chains lashed out towards the giant sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang! Ning and the rest of the seven had poured tremendous
power into the giant sword, giving it incredible strength, but the
five violet-gold chains were just as tenacious. The worst part was,
their movements now became incredibly profound as well! Ning’s
group clearly had a slight advantage in power, but the sword was
still unable to shake off those violet-gold chains!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was due to the difference in depths of insight between them and
Iyerre. It was much like how three of those Autarch-class void
dwellers had encircled Bolin to no avail. Even if they truly had
attacked Bolin with their full power, they wouldn’t have been able
to do anything to him. If your insights were lacking, you wouldn’t
be able to defeat your foe unless you had an absolute advantage in
personal strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant sword had been tied down by five violet-gold chains! As for the
remaining four, they simultaneously struck out to attack the giant
black serpent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Explosions rang out as they clashed again and again. The
giant black serpent hurriedly fled while trying to defend as best it
could, but the violet-gold chains were now being marvelously
controlled by Iyerre and tremendously strengthened by the ignition of
the world’s quintessence core! Although Autarch Titanos was in
control of the black serpent and the five avatars worked in harmony
to defend, the defensive perimeter was still breached after just one
round of blows.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiip.
One of the serpentine heads was securely latched onto by a
violet-gold chain, then physically ripped off!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
Moments later, another serpentine head was delivered a furious blow
from up high by a different violet-gold chain, and the force of the
collision was so great that Autarch Ekong’s avatar (located inside
the head) was completely destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, the four violet-gold chains’ furious attacks
had caused the giant black serpent to completely collapse. All five
avatars died in battle, with none being able to escape!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
caused Ning and the others to feel both sorrow and grief, but there
was nothing they could do. It had all happened too quickly! As soon
as Iyerre had returned, he had killed Bolin’s avatar and then
immediately used those nine violet-gold chains to launch a series of
consecutive attacks. There had been no chance to flee at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Grassland World was a vast place, while spacetime was suppressed
here. The black serpent needed to slowly fly away if it wished to
escape, but Iyerre wasn’t going to give it the time needed. This
was the exact reason why Ning and the others hadn’t dared to risk
their true bodies inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Going
in would be easy. Coming out would be very difficult!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee.”
The giant sword quickly fled backwards, while the nine violet-gold
chains immediately swung to attack it. For a time, both sides
appeared to be equal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant sword was different from the black serpent. The sword had been
formed from a complete merger of the energies of the seven Autarchs.
This was far superior to the black serpent, which simply represented
five Autarchs working together in harmony! The giant sword was a
single whole and guided by Ning’s Sword Dao. Every single strike of
the sword was filled with tremendous power, making it impossible for
the nine violet-gold chains to defeat it, much less destroy it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short moment later, the giant sword flew out from the grayish clouds
and escaped from the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
raised his head, glaring. If he had poured in all of his power he
would’ve been able to prevent that sword from escaping, but there
was no point. That sword had simply consisted of energy and some
Universe treasures. Ning and the others could’ve quickly forged
more Universe treasures to replace them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
should keep my true killer attacks hidden until the very end. It
isn’t worth exposing it on just a few Universe treasures.” Iyerre
raised his head, staring at the formation-incarnation in the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
incarnation was staring at Iyerre as well. Moments later, it waved
its arm and then retreated from the clouds as well. Whoooosh! The
gray clouds quickly closed over, allowing the Grassland World to grow
calm again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
outside world. The great formation continued to cover the entire vast
area surrounding the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning, Titanos, Mogg, Bolin, Skyfeeder, Ekong, and Stonerule felt both
sorrow and anger as they stared at the ovaloid Grassland World before
them. Three of the five avatars they had just lost were peak-strength
avatars, but they had been wiped out in just a twinkling. This taught
them a lesson with regards to just how powerful Iyerre was once he
joined together with the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Iyerre had carried the Grassland World with him in his mission
to kill Ning. Alas, Ning managed to escape before he reached that
temple! Thus, Iyerre had chosen to separate from his Grassland World
and gone Autarch-hunting! Autarch Mogg had managed to survive thanks
to his Golden Bridge of Freedom, while Autarch Bolin had nearly died
while only barely surviving thanks to comprehending the Samsara
Daobirth ESssence at the critical moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
and the Grassland World combine to form a much more deadly opponent,”
Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has a far higher level of insight than us.” Stonerule slowly shook
his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what if he does? We’ll kill anyone who dares to invade our
Chaosverse, even if it costs us our very lives.” Autarch Stonerule
gritted his teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment… boom! The ovaloid ‘Grassland World’ quickly
shrank in size inside the formation. Moments later, a spacetime rift
appeared next to it. Swoosh! It flew straight into the spacetime
rift. This caused Ning and the others to feel their hearts lurch.
They had suspected all along that their formations were unable to
bind Iyerre, but seeing it with their own eyes was still rather
demoralizing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait,
he didn’t leave yet!” Ning and the others turned to stare at the
rift which had just appeared outside the reach of their formation.
The ovaloid Grassland World had actually just flown out there!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivator
leaders, did you think that I had fled? No, no. How could I flee?”
Iyerre’s voice echoed throughout every inch of the void. “ Let’s
see just how powerful your formations are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“BREAK!!!”
Iyerre let out a furious shout, and those nine violet-gold chains
suddenly appeared on the surface of the ovaloid object. The
violet-gold chains expanded in size, each becoming a trillion
kilometers in length as they swept through the void with ineffable
majesty. With Iyerre in control of them and with the ignited
quintessence strengthening them, they began to furiously smash down
upon Ning’s enormous formation! Iyerre was able to immediately see
the flaws in this formation and so his every attack was aimed at a
weak spot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The entire formation immediately began to shudder as a
level of power comparable to the divine sword’s began to hammer
down upon its various weak spots. This wasn’t a defensive
formation; there was only so much punishment it could take!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
leave for now.” Ning and the others were all quite patient. All of
them had prepared escape-type treasures, and they had also opened up
a spacetime tunnel within the formation itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning and the others immediately flew into the spacetime corridor and
departed.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">1.
In China, the plum blossom symbolizes perseverance, hope, and beauty.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_002__The"></A>
Chapter 2: Weakness, Hunt</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that Ji Ning and the other Autarchs were no longer actively
maintaining the grand formation which covered this region, it quickly
crumbled beneath the strikes of the violet-golden chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, four figures emerged from the grayish clouds which
constituted the surfaced of the ovaloid Grassland World. It was
Iyerre and his three allies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
fled,” the silver-robed woman murmured softly. “Iyerre, this is
their homeland. These cultivators can fight or flee as they please.
If we aren’t able to trap them, we won’t be able to kill them at
all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are all extremely wily. As soon as the odds turn against them, they
immediately flee.” The red-robed man frowned as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree with everything you two just said.” Iyerre nodded. Killing
Ning and the Autarchs would be very difficult, because they all fled
at the first sign of bad news! Iyerre was constantly being suppressed
by this local Chaosverse, and so once they fled in unison he wouldn’t
be able to chase them down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
could suppress spacetime to make it impossible for them to flee, then
warp through spacetime after them… but as he tried to warp close
enough to do this, ripples would be generated. Once Ning and the
others sensed this, they would instantly flee far away. Iyerre still
wouldn’t be able to catch them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why he had been able to do this to Mogg was because he had
gotten close enough to use something akin to a domain-field to
prevent Mogg from escaping. Now that Ning and the others were all
together and working in concert, Iyerre’s domain would no longer be
able to bind them any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words… neither speed, suppression of spacetime, nor domains
would work. There was nothing which could actually trap Ning and the
others. They could come and go as they pleased! It must be remembered
that the native Autarchs were in no hurry to conclude the war right
away. The longer it dragged on for, the better. If it somehow dragged
on for a few million chaos cycles, their Chaosverse would have given
birth to another batch of experts that might include new Autarchs or
Omega Emperors!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that the cultivators had the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’, the rate at
which they produced Autarchs would naturally increase significantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are slippery and cautious. They won’t give us a chance to catch
them,” Iyerre said. “Our plan was to use the sudden appearances
of myself and the Grassland World to achieve dramatic successes, but
in the end both failed. However… in the end, none of it matters.
I’ve fully mapped out all possibilities for this entire war. They
won’t be able to escape their fate. In the end, we shall still win
this war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
three allies were rather puzzled. Such self-confidence… where did
it stem from? If they couldn’t even catch or hunt down their foes,
how were they supposed to beat them?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me repeat myself. I’ve fully mapped out ALL possibilities for this
entire war,” Iyerre said with a smile. “Have you forgotten that I
sent out the Annihilation Hive at the very beginning of this war?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Annihilation Hive?” The three were startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haven’t
the cultivators already discovered a way to counteract the
Annihilation Hive? It’s no longer functioning, right?” the
silver-robed woman asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Imbecile.”
Iyerre glanced sideways at her. “I released the Annihilation Hive
for two reasons. The first was on the off-chance that I might be able
to gain total victory if it succeeded in devouring a great deal of
this Chaosverse’s energies and caused it to weaken enough for me to
take over. This objective failed… but the second objective was the
true objective.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
sent it out to make it the most lethal weak point in this entire
Chaosverse for the cultivators!” Iyerre’s eyes flashed coldly.
“Right now, a single one of their avatars is responsible for
maintaining the formation that is tying down the Annihilation Hive.
All we need to do is charge towards it and destroy the avatar inside
the Annihilation Hive, at which point it will start to function
again!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Annihilation Hive will once more begin to devour the energies from
the Chaosverse, causing it to weaken! The cultivator leaders will be
forced to try and stop us. They can’t just sit back and watch as
their Chaosverse wastes away… which means that so long as we wait
for them at the Annihilation Hive, they’ll be forced to come to us!
They’ll obediently step into the battlefield we have parepared.”
Iyerre smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
silver-robed woman and the other two revealed looks of delight. They
had thought that the Annihilation Hive was of no further use now that
it had been counteracted. They hadn’t fully thought through all the
other implications.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive.
So long as the Annihilation Hive continues to function, the
cultivators will be forced to come and assault it no matter how
reluctant they may be. We don’t need to do anything at all. They’ll
come to us!” the red-robed man chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go wipe them out in the battlefield of our choosing,” the
black-robed man said grimly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
rush.” Iyerre smiled. “A war must be carried out step-by-step.
You might see an occasional setback, but if you fully planned for all
possibilities then you’ll still end up the ultimate victor.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right
now, what we need to do is strengthen our forces! Let’s go rescue
those trapped Exalts first,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Violet-gold chains began to fly out towards the still-trapped Nine
Cicadas Temple. The sealing formation surrounding it was nothing more
than a joke to Iyerre. A mere heartbeat later the
seemingly-complicated formation had been completely undone, granting
the nine Sithe Exalts freedom once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine Exalts immediately flew over. When they saw Iyerre standing atop
the distant gray clouds, they hurriedly bowed: “Almighty Iyerre!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
here. We shall head to the next location.” Iyerre nodded. The Sithe
Exalts immediately put away the Nine Cicadas Temple and flew into the
Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, the Grassland World once more tore through spacetime and
vanished. As soon as it did, a group of figures suddenly appeared off
in the distance. It was Ji Ning, Autarch Titanos, and the others. The
seven of them hadn’t fled too far through spacetime. They had
quickly warped back in secret to scry this place from nearby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
movements didn’t cause any disturbances, because they were
protected rather than rejected by the Chaosverse. In fact, they were
even able to borrow the Chaosverse’s energies to ‘watch’ their
opponents from afar!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was Ning’s primary responsibility to ‘watch’ them, as he was
extremely skilled in spacetime and well-rounded in many other areas.
Given that he was within his own Chaosverse, simply keeping watch on
someone from afar was quite simple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
were ambushed by them previously. There’s no way we’re going to
let them just disappear again. We have to keep tabs on their location
at all times,” Autarch Titanos said. “All of our avatars have
been destroyed, which means we have no choice but to simply send our
true bodies to carry out this task. Darknorth, for now we’ll have
to trouble you to carry this out as the rest of us work on remaking
our avatars.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. The others had all lost their avatars, while his was
still in the Annihilation Hive and in peak condition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could still sense them from afar. He could follow the ripples
generated by the Grassland World warping through spacetime and ‘see’
where it was heading.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning began to warp through spacetime with the other six in tow,
maintaining a distance of roughly a realmverse from the Grassland
World. To Ning, a realmverse of distance was nothing at all. His
godsense alone vastly outstripped this, and when he relied upon the
powers of the Chaosverse and his link to the prime essences he was
able to ‘watch’ from an even more ridiculously great distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
long as the two sides maintained a distance of just a realmverse
away, Iyerre wouldn’t be able to easily detect Ning thanks to the
Chaosverse constantly suppressing his powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
Ning continued to pursue the Grassland World, Titanos and the others
created their new avatars. These avatars merely had 50% of their true
power, which was the best they could do on such short notice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Judging
from the direction they are taking, they should be going to go rescue
another temple,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
let us destroy it in advance,” Autarch Titanos said. “Given our
power, we are completely capable of working together to destroy the
temples in a short period of time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
they hadn’t considered the temples to be much of a threat. They
didn’t want to attack the temples and reveal the techniques they
could use when fighting together, as this would give their opponents
a chance to prepare for them in the future. The reveal had to be
reserved for the Grassland World… and in the end, they had
successfully destroyed one of the conduit formations and forced the
ignition of its quintessence core!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
keep following the Grassland World. Whenever it tries to rescue a
temple, we’ll fly up ahead and destroy that temple,” Autarch
Ekong said with a cold smile. “We warp through spacetime far faster
than that thing does.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others held a significant advantage in both flying speed and
warping speed. Even Iyerre was able to just barely meet Autarch
standards of speed in warping through spacetime, but of course this
was because he was being heavily suppressed by the local Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivators spent nearly a month travelling at high speed. In about
six or so days, the Grassland World would reach a new temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skyfeeder,
Mogg, the two of you should have your avatars continue to track the
Grassland World’s movements. Make sure you know where it is at all
times. Don’t lose sight of it!” Out of an abundance of caution,
Autarch Titanos gave this task to Skyfeeder and Mogg. The two of them
were skilled in time and space, respectively. “The rest of us will
head out and move towards the nearest temple at maximum speed and use
all our power to destroy it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The avatars of Mogg and Skyfeeder were both extremely confident.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_003__The"></A>
Chapter 3: Skycleaver Stance</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
great star-like temple was silently floating within the Great Dark,
surrounded by formations and flowing barriers that surrounded it and
kept it completely sealed away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip.
A rift in the darkness appeared, followed by Ji Ning and the rest of
the seven emerging from within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
begin.” Ning, Titanos, and the others exchanged smiling glances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
will be the first time we have the Sword Titan release its full power
in battle,” Ning said with a laugh. All of them began to pour
energy into the formation-bases they were holding. Boom! They quickly
summoned the awesome power of the Chaosverse, which began to swiftly
condense into the form of a nearly nude giant who was clad in just a
fur loincloth. This titan stood there in the Great Darkness, his long
dark hair spilling across his shoulders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had two arms and a face which looked similar to Ning’s but had more
of the cold, pure remorselessness of the Dao of the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan had two different ‘modes’. The first mode was the
seven-faced, fourteen-armed mode they had used previously. This mode
used up more energy but it had so much power that the other six
Autarchs could each be responsible for controlling two arms as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second mode was this mode. It had just a single face and two arms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others had already concluded that they would have to fight
together during the final battle. If they had enough time, they would
of course set up formations to prepare the battlefield. Before the
battle near the Nine Cicadas Temple, they had actually spent nearly a
month setting up that grand formation (the ‘real’ time they spent
was 100x as much). However, oftentimes battles would break out
suddenly and without warning, giving you no chance to slowly
establish the formations you needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
such times, they would need to make use of mobile formations they
could carry with them. They would have to shrink the size of the
formation while preserving as much of its power as possible… and so
they developed the ‘second mode’ of the Sword Titan!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second mode was activated by the various formation-bases which Ning
and the others carried with them at all times. It allowed them to
summon the power of the Chaosverse and then materialize this body.
Given that it had access to less power, they had to be a bit more
sparing with their energy usage and so they only kept the two
strongest arms which Ning controlled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two arms which Ning was in control of was where most of the power of
the entire Sword Titan was concentrated. More than 90% of the power
was there!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
let us use the Skycleaver stance in cracking this temple,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The other six understood and agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the loincloth-clad Sword Titan strode through the void, a longsword
appearing within one of its hands. This was one of Ning’s Northbow
swords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Mogg, Autarch Stonerule, Autarch
Ekong, and Autarch Bolin were inside the Sword Titan. They
immediately unleashed their various techniques, filling the Sword
Titan’s body with their six roaring streams of energy. Under Ning’s
guidance, all of the different energies merged perfectly into the
Omega Sword Dao, allowing the Sword Titan to unleash the most
powerful of its many fusion attacks – the Skycleaver stance!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The Sword Titan’s two hands came together to grasp the Northbow
sword in a double grip, then lifted it high into the air. A heartbeat
later, it brought the Northbow sword down in an utterly indomitable
chop towards the trapped astral temple before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Crack! The entire astral temple began to shudder. This strike
destroyed three of the six formations protecting it, and even the
remaining three formations were shuddering as explosions rang out
across the temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
in the world is happening outside?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Didn’t
almighty Iyerre say that he’s about to arrive and save us? Why are
our formations collapsing?!” The seven Sithe Exalts inside all felt
quite terrified, but the formations sealing them in here prevented
them from seeing what was happening outside. All they could sense was
that just now, an incomparably sharp power had come crashing down
upon them and had nearly blasted the entire temple apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
The Sword Titan delivered a second chop, then a third chop. Every
single blow was filled with utterly terrifying power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why these two arms were the ‘strongest’ arms was precisely
because these were the arms which Ning was in control of. The other
six Autarchs worked together to unleash their Daos, while Ning guided
the power of their Daos into ‘his’ two arms to unleash the most
powerful of attacks. If they were in the ‘first mode’ with
fourteen arms, the other Autarchs would individually control the
other twelve arms. However, they were unable to make perfect use of
their colleagues’ energies. They were only able to mobilize a
fraction of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words, those twelve arms combined weren’t nearly as strong as
the two arms which Ning controlled. Thus, even when the Sword Titan
was at ‘peak’ power, more than 90% of its strength came from
these two ‘primary’ arms!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick,
go into lockdown mode!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Completely
seal the temple off from outside attacks!” The Sithe Exalts within
the temple were panicking like mad. The formations had already been
disposed of. Now, their only choice was to try and use the natural
sturdiness of the temple itself to defend against these attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Titan did not elect to blink inside the temple. Instead, the
sword Titan continued to launched frenzied blows from outside using
the Skycleaver stance! Every single strike contained the full power
from seven Autarch-class combatants which had been perfectly fused
together via the Eternal Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a level of power that far surpassed that of the ‘giant sword’
and the ‘black serpent’ which had fought in the Grassland World,
and it was also mightier than the violet-gold chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The temple was even sturdier than Universe weapons, but
after nearly a hundred blows it finally began to crumble. Moments
later it completely blew apart, with the Sithe Exalts inside being
reduced to dust by the leftover power from the final Skycleaver
stance. This was as to be expected – even the Autarchs, the
creators of the Skycleaver stance, would’ve been destroyed in one
blow from this overwhelmingly powerful fusion attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
felt incredible! Unleashing the full power of the Sword Titan was a
wonderful feeling.” The Sword Titan broke apart, revealing the
figures of the seven. Autarch Ekong was particularly excited by what
they had just done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been a long time since I’ve had that much fun. The Skycleaver
stance truly is astonishingly powerful,” Autarch Titanos said with
a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
my opinion, all the various techniques and trump cards we have
accumulated over the aeons should make it so that we are entirely
capable of fighting the Grassland World head-on,” Autarch Ekong
said. “Last time, we retreated before we really had a chance to
test ourselves. That was irritating! I think we were entirely capable
of winning if we fought them head-on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “Don’t underestimate the Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
is right. There’s no need for us to risk ourselves like that. The
longer we can delay the final battle, the greater our advantage shall
be. We need to slowly bide our time and allow our natural advantage
to accumulate into an overwhelming one. You need patience to win a
war,” Autarch Titanos said. “We don’t need to be anxious. It is
the Sithe, it is Iyerre, who need to be anxious!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
sides were led by wily old bastards who had been alive for
unfathomable ages. Both had plenty of patience. Iyerre, for example,
had made preparations for all possibilities. Even though he had
encountered repeated setbacks, he felt certain that it wouldn’t
impact the grand scheme of things. He knew that victory would be his.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivators, in turn, knew what their own advantages and
disadvantages were. If they could make maximum use of their
advantages, they’ll gain victory in the end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Iyerre was seated in the lotus position on the grass within the
Grassland World, which was hurtling through spacetime. Suddenly, his
face tightened. He could sense that the auras of the seven Sithe
Exalts he had been planning to rescue had suddenly vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dead?”
Iyerre frowned. “Did the cultivators somehow predict that we were
going to go rescue them and so moved ahead of us to destroy the
temple and kill the Exalts?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
began to feel rather suspicious. “Let’s head in another
direction.” Iyerre immediately sent the Grassland World to move
towards a different temple, the Six Seals Temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Half
a month went past. Iyerre had yet to reach the Six Seals Temple, but
he could sense that it had also been destroyed. This caused his face
to darken.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
another half-month, the final remaining temple was also destroyed,
with the six Sithe Exalts within being slaughtered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.
This Chaosverse continues to suppress us, making it so that we cannot
warp through spacetime as fast as those weak natives. In fact… are
they perhaps following us in secret?” Iyerre was quite irritated,
but there was nothing he could do. He was at an environmental
disadvantage here. “Fine then. The Exalts didn’t make too much of
a difference. We shall still win without them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hear
my orders.” Iyerre’s voice suddenly echoed throughout the entire
Grassland World. His three colleages, the Autarch-class void
dwellers, and the Exalts including Bowenya all heard his voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
are heading to the Annihilation Hive right away! The cultivators must
fight us, which means they must engage us in battle. There’s no way
for them to avoid this! They’ll have to battle us to the end…
which means that this is the last battle. If we win, we’ll have
achieved victory and I, Iyerre, promise to give you everything you
desire. If we lose, none of you will survive.” Iyerre’s face was
cold and calm, and his voice was very peaceful as well, but his
subordinates all shivered when they heard it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The Grassland World suddenly changed directions once more, moving
towards the Annihilation Hive!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was possible that the cultivators were secretly following them from
behind, but Iyerre didn’t care. He was going to head straight
towards his target openly. The cultivators might know what he was
doing, but it wouldn’t matter. They would still have to come and
fight him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
avatars of Autarch Skyfeeder and Autarch Mogg were charged with
following the Grassland World. After following its new trajectory for
over half a day, they were able to realize where the Grassland World
was now headed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Annihilation Hive?” The two avatars traded a glance in the
darkness. Both of them understood what the Sithe were planning, and
they couldn’t help but turn pale.</P>

Chapter 4: Within the Annihilation Hive</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe are heading for the Annihilation Hive?” Ji Ning, Titanos,
Mogg, Skyfeeder, Stonerule, Bolin, and Ekong fell silent. They stood
there within the Great Dark, staring at each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos
said in a low voice, “I imagine you all know what their plan is.
They are going to go to the Annihilation Hive and destroy Darknorth’s
avatar! That will allow the Annihilation Hive to continue devouring
power from our Chaosverse. We have to fight them there. We can’t
let it just continue to weaken our Chaosverse unabated. Yes… we
have no other options.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
do have another option!” Hard light flashed through Autarch Ekong’s
eyes. “We’re faster than them. Let’s get to the Annihilation
Hive first and destroy its quintessence core!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
the sphere of annihilation?” The others were all intrigued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
it possible?” Autarch Titanos looked at Ning. Ning knew more about
it than anyone else present.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
quintessence of the Annihilation Hive holds the mysteries of a type
of destruction which I have named ‘Oblivion’ within it. It is
incomparably profound and also tremendously powerful. I’m not even
close to being strong enough to destroy it,” Ning said. “However…
when we work together, we are also tremendously powerful. Perhaps we
might just manage to destroy it after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to! Once we destroy the sphere of annihilation, they’ll have
nothing to threaten us with,” Autarch Ekong said eagerly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
the sphere of annihilation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
we join forces, we are virtually unstoppable. We were able to crush
entire temples in head-on attacks. I refuse to believe we can’t
crack that thing!” Autarch Bolin’s eyes were filled with
malevolence as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of them wanted to be led around by the nose by their foes!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
they all knew that it was uncertain as to whether or not they would
be able to damage the ‘sphere of annihilation’. It was a
completely foreign object that they knew nothing about… but they
had to make the attempt! If they succeeded, they’d celebrate. If
they failed, then they would have to go stop the Sithe!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope this works.” Ning looked at his six comrades, silently praying
to himself as he did. His avatar had been analyzing the sphere of
annihilation for many years, and the more he understood the more
nervous he felt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come.
Let us go to the Annihilation Hive!” They immediately began to
speed towards the Annihilation Hive at maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Roughly
one month later, they finally reached the Annihilation Hive. Iyerre’s
team was still far away; they’d probably need over half a month
before they would arrive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Annihilation Hive.” The seven of them stood shoulder-to-shoulder,
staring at the great hive before them. It remained vast beyond
measure, but the sucking power from it was now much weaker than when
it was at full power. It was still able to destroy the raw darkness
in the area around it, but the energies released by the destroyed
darkness all returned to the prime essences of the Chaosverse. There
was no way to steal them away at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
try and see if we can destroy the entire thing first,” Autarch
Titanos said. “If we can, we don’t need to worry about destroying
the sphere of annihilation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sphere of annihilation, by itself, didn’t have the power to
forcibly take energy from an entire Chaosverse. It was all thanks to
the formation supporting it that made this possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Bolin looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
try using the Skycleaver stance with full power,” Ning said. The
Skycleaver stance wasn’t necessarily the best technique to use in
actual combat, but it was definitely the best for causing
destruction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
the towering, loincloth-clad Sword Titan once more appeared within
the emptiness of space. He strode towards the behemoth hive, glowing
with pure sword-intent. Every single movement he made radiated power
and destruction, and he quickly reached the surface of the behemoth
hive. He then drew an enormous sword with his right hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skycleaver
stance!” The Sword Titan held the sword in a two-handed grip,
lifting it up high over his head. The six Autarchs began to use their
various techniques, allowing Ning to guide their different Daos to
merge together and unleash the Skycleaver stance! This was actually
just one stance of an entire set of sword-arts which Ning had created
for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The divine sword came crashing down, shattering spacetime and
splintering the Five Elements. It destroyed all in its path as it
came crashing down with absolutely terrifying power towards the
surface of the Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A massive explosion occurred, causing even the enormous behemoth hive
to tremble. As for Ning’s Sword Titan? A powerful counter-force
pushed back against him, sending it stumbling a few steps backwards
in space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was simply too powerful. Not even Ning’s Sword Dao was able to
completely deflect this counter-force, and so the Sword Titan had to
endure much of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
does it look? Any cracks?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
we cause any damage to it?” Ning and the others carefully inspected
the behemoth hive while asking each other the same question. They
were all hoping that the thing had been at least slightly damaged.
Even the tiniest of cracks would symbolize that if they continued to
hammer away at it, they would be able to completely destroy it in
time. Alas, none of them could discover any cracks at all, which was
why they were all asking the others if they saw anything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t find any. I don’t see any damage at all.” Their hearts
all began to sink.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
try a few more attacks and see if that does anything,” Autarch
Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning and the others nodded. They once more joined forces, having the
Sword Titan raise its sword up high for the Skycleaver stance once
more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! The Sword Titan delivered the terrifying Skycleaver
stance again and again, furiously smoting the Annihilation Hive and
causing it to shudder and even fly backwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within a three-hundred meter hidden space inside the Annihilation
Hive, there was a formation-base with a long-haired man seated in the
lotus position atop it. The long-haired man’s hair was half black
and half white, and he was nervously keeping track of the hive’s
status.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Every single explosion caused the entire Annihilation
Hive to shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
is attacking the Annihilation Hive from outside?” Exalt Anitya was
rather startled and nervous. He was only able to see what was
happening within the hive; he was unable to see the outside world.
“The entire Annihilation Hive is actually trembling. This level of
power far surpasses what Emperor Darknorth can accomplish. Can it be
that the cultivator leaders have joined forces?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Anitya was rather nervous, but a short while later the attacks came
to a halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
dealt over a thousand strikes, but they weren’t able to even
scratch the Annihilation Hive.” Exalt Anitya let out a sigh of
relief. The Annihilation Hive was one of the most important Sithe
trump cards, and it had been just as expensive to create as the
Grassland World. It was far more powerful than the various temples.
It wouldn’t be easy to destroy it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.
Outsiders have just come inside.” Exalt Anitya stared at the images
which appeared before him. They displayed a stream of power that flew
inside the hive and towards its core hive. The light and power
surrounding the figure was so blinding that Exalt Anitya was unable
to see who it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to report this.” Exalt Anitya immediately contacted Iyerre.
The formation-base below him slowly began to swivel as a pillar of
light appeared. A figure appeared within the pillar of light which
solidified into the seated form of Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Anitya rose and bowed respectfully: “Almighty Iyerre, new invaders
have entered the Annihilation Hive. They tried to assault the hive
from outside, and they attacked over a thousand times with shocking
levels of power. However, they still weren’t able to even scratch
the Annihilation Hive!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Iyerre’s eyes flashed coldly. “Someone actually dared to assault
the Annihilation Hive? It must haver been those cultivator leaders
working together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are moving closer and closer towards the core. They’ll reach the
sphere of annihilation soon. Will they be able to destroy it?”
Exalt Anitya was worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
keep watching. Don’t take any other action,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
Exalt Anitya said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The pillar of light vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the behemoth hive. Ning and the other Autarchs had already reached
the black pyramid located at the center of the vortex of astral
clouds, reuniting with Ning’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the sphere of annihilation?” Autarch Ekong stared at the
nearby shadowy black orb, which continued to devour everything
surrounding it. It was like an endless hole that swallowed and
destroyed all things! It embodied the essence of ‘Oblivion’,
causing the Autarchs to feel a sense of trepidation when they looked
at it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
type of profound mysteries does this thing hold, for it to be able to
destroy all things? It seems as though there is nothing whatsoever
which surpasses it,” Autarch Stonerule said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had attuned to many different Daos before, but the mysteries embodied
by this sphere of annihilation were more profound than any they had
ever studied. It eclipsed all Daos they had seen. The so-called
‘Omega Daos’ and ‘Daobirth Essences’… they would all be
devoured and destroyed by this power of ‘Oblivion’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
avatar has been meditating here for many years and is able to
replicate a bit of Oblivion’s power.” Ning shook his head. “But
I still do not understand its true nature.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
Destruction Daobirth Essence is shallow and crude in comparison,”
Autarch Ekong sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
might be at the same level of insight as this ‘Oblivion’ Dao,”
Autarch Mogg said. “But maybe not. He’s so far above us that we
cannot judge him accurately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Autarchs had extremely profound levels of insight, perhaps as
profound as the mysteries of Oblivion. Both were far beyond the likes
of these seven to comprehend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, it is simply a naturally-occuring quintessence core. It’s
unable to fight back against us. The seven of us, when working
together, can summon the power of the Chaosverse itself. We should be
able to destroy it,” Autarch Ekong said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_005__The"></A>
Chapter 5: Laughter</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning and the rest of the seven stared at the shadowy black orb. There
was utter stillness. Even their auras seemed to have frozen. All of
them had experienced countless things as they had ascended the path
of cultivation to reach their current heights, but they now felt a
sense of tremendous pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sphere of annihilation was an inimical threat to their entire
Chaosverse. If they could destroy it then things would be much
simpler… but if they failed, they would have no choice but to begin
the final, deadly battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
seven of them exchanged a glance, nodding silently to each other.
They were out of options. They had already tried to destroy both the
behemoth hive and the black tower, but they were unable to do so!
Now, their last chance lay in attacking the ‘sphere of
annihilation’ at the center of the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
an awesome amount of the Dao’s power was being gathered here, with
Ning and the rest of the seven guiding it to form the towering,
loincloth-clad titan. They simply didn’t have enough time to set up
the full formation, as the Sithe would be arriving in nearly half a
month. Using the second mode of the Sword Titan was the best they
could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
the sphere of annihilation!” The Sword Titan strode through the
air, a greatsword appearing within his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
Ning ordered. Within the Sword Titan, the six Autarchs immediately
began to unleash their most powerful attacks. Six massive streams of
energy quickly began to course through the Sword Titan’s body, then
slowly began to coalesce into one. The Sword Titan lifted up its
arms, double-gripping a massive greatsword and then delivering a
furious blow towards the shadowy orb before it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the sword chopped out, it destroyed all the different types of energy
that were in its path, reducing them to nothingness. This was the
Skycleaver stance!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has to break.” Ning and the rest of the six watched hopefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The sword smote furiously upon the shadowy orb, which instantly began
to twist and distort. The power of this sword was simply too great!
The orb was distorted, transforming from being a perfectly round
globe into an ovaloid shape. Some cracks actually began to appear at
its edges as the sword slashed right through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
we succeed?” When Ning and the others saw the black orb elongate
and crack, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of wild excitement.
But then… their hearts turned cold. The shadowy black orb once more
returned to its normal spherical shape, continuing to devour
everything around it while the cracks went back to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Try
again!” Autarch Titanos commanded desperately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Again!”
Ning gritted his teeth. He truly didn’t wish to admit defeat!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The Sword Titan began to strike again and again against
the shadowy black orb, each strike filled with such incredible power
that the black orb repeatedly cracked apart… but each time, it
quickly healed afterwards and then continued to devour away at its
surroundings. It wasn’t weakened in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
striking several thousand times, Ning and the others finally gave up.
Their hearts were ice-cold. The Sword Titan vanished, revealing the
bodies of Ning and the other six. They all stared silently at the
shadowy black orb.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
long silence ensued. Suddenly, Ning spoke out: “We haven’t failed
yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The other six looked at Ning. They had already attacked with all
their might. Could it be that Daolord Darknorth had another
suggestion?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin…
ever since you mastered the Samsara Daobirth Essence, I’ve been
ruminating on creating a new sword-art,” Ning said. “When we came
together to form the Sword Titan, the Skycleaver stance we used was
based off a sword-art I created which was meant to use the Space
Daobirth Essence, Time Daobirth Essence, Claw Daobirth Essence,
Illusion Daobirth Essence, Destruction Daobirth Essence, and Karma
Daobirth Essence!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
employs six types of Daobirth Essences… but now, brother Bolin, you
have also mastered the Samsara Daobirth Essence. I think I can create
an even more powerful set of sword-arts which employs seven different
Daobirth Essences, which would make our Sword Titan even more
powerful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos,
Bolin, and the others were all delighted by this. Right! Their
sword-art was based off of using six Daobirth Essences. There was no
reason why they couldn’t upgrade it to use seven instead!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
already have the rough outline of this sword-art in my mind,” Ning
said, “But I’ve still been in the process of perfecting it. Give
me enough time to finish it and make it even more powerful!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
accelerate time for you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
it at your own pace, Darknorth. Don’t try to rush. We still have
more than half a month.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos
and the others instantly worked to assist him. If he was able to
create a new sword-art, even if it wasn’t enough to destroy the
sphere of annihilation it would still strengthen their Sword Titan
and make it more formidable during the battle to come.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder took over the responsibility for accelerating time, letting
Ning calmly set his mind upon perfecting this sword-art. Ning himself
had long ago mastered the Samsara Sword Dao. All he had to do was to
link it to Bolin’s Daobirth Essence, which was fairly easy.
However, what Ning was trying to do was to perfect this technique and
make it even more powerful! He actually had Titanos and the others
try the new stance out, then went back to continue working at it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one day after another. The power of this new fusion
sword-art grew increasingly mighty. Meanwhile, the avatars of Mogg
and Skyfeeder continued to follow Iyerre’s Grassland World, ready
to report anything that needed reporting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
still have two more days before Iyerre’s world of grass arrives
here,” Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already completed the sword-art.” Ning nodded. “I won’t be able
to make any improvements unless I’m given another ten thousand
years.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were a total of four stances to this fusion sword-art! Their names
remained unchanged: Skycleaver stance, Brightcave stance, Dawnmoon
stance, and World stance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that my Omega Sword Dao is guiding seven different types of Daobirth
Essences when using this sword-art, the power has increased by nearly
30% compared to before,” Ning said. Titanos and the others were
delighted to hear this. Given how powerful the Sword Titan was,
increasing its power by even a tiny bit was extremely difficult. A
30% increase was absolutely incredible! This was primarily due to the
fact that the Samsara Daobirth Essence was an extremely powerful
Daobirth Essence to begin with, one which empowered the new sword-art
tremendously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
us begin.” The seven exchanged glances, then stared at the distant
shadowy orb. They activated the various formation-bases they were
carrying, summoning the power of the Chaosverse and converting it to
form the loincloth-clad Sword Titan. The Sword Titan hefted a
greatsword, once more preparing to unleash its supremely powerful
Skycleaver stance! This time, of course, it was the new version of
the Skycleaver stance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seven
different streams of Daobirth Essence power coursed through the Sword
Titan. Ning was able to easily unite the seven streams into a single
whole, forming his Omega Sword Dao with their powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skycleaver
stance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan once more chopped down at the shadowy orb, but this time
it was noticeably more powerful than before. Boom! Boom! Boom! The
divine sword plunged deep into the shadowy orb, causing a series of
explosions to ring out. The black orb began to crack and shatter in
many different places as the sword went into the orb and out the
other side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black orb looked heavily damaged, but some invisible law once more
pulled it back together. It quickly returned to its normal shape and
began to once more calmly devour everything around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Still
no permanent damage?” Ning could hardly believe his eyes. They
launched another hundred strikes, but the result was the same. Each
time, the black orb looked as though it was so heavily damaged that
it would most assuredly break apart, but instead it would quickly
heal. It was like a globe of water. No matter how much ‘damage’
they caused to it, it would easily reform into a globe once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan vanished. Ning and the other six stared at the black orb
in disbelief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn,”
Ning muttered, gritting his teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!
Oh well.” Autarch Ekong actually began to laugh loudly, a frenzied
look in his eyes. “I’ve wanted to have a good fight against the
Sithe for ages now. We have so many tools at our disposal, but we’ve
never dared to take on the risk of actually using them because we’re
afraid to lose. Now? Now, we have no way out. They’ve forced us to
stand and fight! Good. Let’s fight then! We’ll risk it all in
this battle. I want to see who will be the survivors – the Sithe,
or us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ekong’s
right. Discard all your fears and all your worries and pour
everything you have into the next battle.” The wily old Autarch
Titanos began to laugh loudly as well. “I’ve been alive for far
too long. I’ve almost forgotten what life used to be like when I
was a weak young cultivator who had to experience one
life-threatening challenge after another. It has been a long time
since I’ve had this sort of feeling where my very truesoul is
shivering in anticipation. Let’s do our best and fight them to the
bitter end!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
joined in their laughter, as did Skyfeeder, Bolin, Mogg, and
Stonerule. Hah! If there was no way out, they would fight. They’d
literally fight the Sithe to the death in this next battle!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen.
It is my honor to be able to battle with you to the bitter end,”
the only female Autarch, Autarch Skyfeeder, said with a smile.</P>

Chapter 6: The Final Battle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
friends, I can’t even describe how happy I am to be able to fight
alongside all of you in this battle,” Autarch Bolin said with a
smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
fight to the bitter end together.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
come! I think we need to share some wine before this battle begins.”
Autarch Ekong waved his hand, causing an estate to appear before him
which was filled with stone tables and chairs. Ji Ning and the others
all smiled as they sat down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
picked up his wine cup, then glanced at his six friends. He felt as
though this was almost a dream. He could still clearly remember how
he had been reborn from the Netherworld Kingdom into the Ji clan of
the Grand Xia, and how he had slowly trained step-by-step until he
had reached the apex of the cultivator world. Now, he would stand
alongside his six friends and peers, entering into a lethal battle by
their sides. This was a battle which would determine the fate of all
cultivators!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they lost, it would all be for nothing. His friends, his family, and
all of civilization would be destined to die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y’know,
I was thinking. Darknorth… should we have your true body stay out
of this final battle?” Autarch Titanos suddenly said. All of the
other Autarchs nearby were stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
take part?” Ning was stunned as well. “Titanos… are you saying,
the rest of you would fight but I wouldn’t?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
avatar could,” Autarch Titanos said slowly. “Here’s what I’m
thinking. We could have your avatar form the Sword Titan with us.
Your avatar has 80% of your true power! You are already the strongest
of us seven. Your avatar is more than strong enough to merge our
powers together. I wager it’ll still be able to keep the Sword
Titan at 90% of its full strength.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we lose, at least your true body would still be alive! So long as you
are alive, our civilizations will have a chance to eventually
recover.” Autarch Titanos looked at Ning. The other five began to
hesitate, considering his words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
my true body doesn’t get involved in this fight, it’ll have a
major impact on our combat prowess,” Ning said. “Both my avatar
and myself will take part in this fight, guiding the six of you in
forming the Sword Titan! If my avatar guides your avatars in forming
a giant, it’ll have roughly 50% to 60% of the the strength of the
main one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
have one Sword Titan and one Avatar Titan. That way, we’ll be able
to unleash the maximum amount of power possible. If my true body
doesn’t take part, we’ll only have a single weakened Sword
Titan,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Avatar Titan would be using the same type of formation. The other six
avatars were only at half power while Ning’s avatar was at 80%
power, but the Avatar Titan would remain a powerful tool in this
fight. It would be even stronger than the giant sword they had used
in the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
if we lose, we’ll have lost all hope,” Titanos said hesitantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Titanos!” Ning said sharply, “Are you still thinking about a
‘backup plan’ at a time like this? Do you really think that I can
reverse the situation all by myself if I’m the only one to survive?
Even if I do eventually become an Omega Autarch, by then I would’ve
had to watch as the Sithe bound our Chaosverse and Iyerre became a
Chaoslord. In the end, I would still die!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
should put everything we have into this fight instead! We’ll use
both the Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan to maximize our chances.”
Ning stared at Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
I agree with Darknorth. This time, screw the backup plans,” Autarch
Ekong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
fight.” Autarch Skyfeeder was by nature a fearless woman. She had
previously been planning to attempt to bind the Chaosverse, even
though the others who had tried all died!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree that we should do everything we can to win this battle.”
Autarch Bolin, Autarch Mogg, and Autarch Stonerule all turned to look
at Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
their level, life and death mattered very little. They actually
approved of Ning throwing himself into danger, because they had to
consider what was good for the whole of civilization. They wanted to
live… but they didn’t want to live a life that was worse than
death! They didn’t fear death… so long as their deaths were
meaningful!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos hesitated a moment, swayed by the rebukes of his six
colleagues. He then let out a self-mocking chuckle: “All my life,
I’ve laid schemes upon schemes and have always had a backup plan
ready. All of you are right. Even if Darknorth survives by himself,
the chance of him being able to reverse a defeat here is minuscule.
Him leaving would lower the strength of our forces. It’s better for
us to fight them to the bitter end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
more like it! How miserable would I feel, watching you all perish
while I survived by myself?” Ning lifted up his tankard of wine and
poured a cup for Titanos. “Come, Titanos, come! I’m going to
punish you with some wine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
accept, I accept.” Titanos immediately took the wine cup.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
seven had already decided to do their utmost in this upcoming battle.
They no longer felt any worries, and so they happily drank together
while awaiting Iyerre’s arrival.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
will be arriving in two hours,” Autarch Mogg said suddenly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
still have two hours left?” Ning and the others exchanged glances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go out and get ready to welcome these outsiders.” Titanos rose to
his feet, as did Ning and the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
They all put away their respective estates and flew out together,
blinking out of the black tower. This time, Ning brought his avatar
out alongside him. The Annihilation Hive once more exploded with
power and began to generate that incredible sucking pour, but the
Sword Titan formed from the seven Autarchs was able to easily pass
out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the Annihilation Hive began to furiously devour the energies of the
outside world at its previous pace as a vortex once more appeared
around it. Ning and the Autarchs, however, simply ignored it.
Although it was a formidable weapon, it needed to devour energy for
an extremely long period of time to do real damage. A few weeks
wouldn’t make much of a difference. Not even a century would have a
real impact.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
for now they would ignore the Annihilation Hive and focus their
efforts on the Sithe. Neither side was going to shirk away from this
battle! Victory or defeat would be determined very soon. The winner
would rule this Chaosverse. The loser would never be able to rise
again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Two figures suddenly warped over to them. It was the avatars
of Autarch Mogg and Autarch Skyfeeder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
our avatars are here. We’re ready to fight now. A pity that we lost
one of the Golden Bridges of Freedom. Otherwise, we’d be at
absolute maximum power,” Autarch Titanos said with a chuckle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
quickly separated into two squads, both led by Ning. The seven true
bodies stood together on one side, while the seven avatars stood next
to each other on the other side. Fourteen Autarch-class combatants
were ready to do battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
all my fault for losing that Golden Bridge.” Autarch Bolin shook
his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t to blame. Those things simply required far too many precious
ingredients. I did everything I could but was only able to create
seven of them. Sometimes, I can’t help but think to myself about
what a coincidence it all was. We originally had an extra, but
Darknorth rose just in the nick of time to round out the seventh,”
Titanos said with a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be able to battle alongside my six predecessors is Darknorth’s
honor,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
seven of them stood in empty space, their hearts at peace. They had
already cast aside all their worries. At a time like this, worrying
wouldn’t make any difference. They simply had to do everything they
could to win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they died, all of civilization would die with them, but there was
nothing for that. The seven of them had truly done all they could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
ovaloid sphere continued to warp through space. Atop its outermost
layer of grayish clouds stood a tall, gray-robed man who was slightly
balding. His eyes seemed to contain the cosmos within them as he
calmly stared at the empty space before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is finally time for the last battle.” Like the cultivators, Iyerre
knew that he had reached the most critical moment in his entire life.
He would either soar to the heavens and become a Lord of Chaos,
becoming the most invincible figure in all the Infinite Void aside
from his master… or he would be defeated and never have this
opportunity again, even if he managed to survive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
hadn’t worried about the sphere of annihilation being destroyed,
because he knew just how marvelous an object it was. There were only
two ways by which it could be destroyed. The first way was to
overpower it. As an Omega Autarch, outside of this foreign Chaosverse
he himself would just barely be able to summon enough power to
destroy it. The second way was to comprehend the apocalyptic
mysteries it contained, at which point one would be able to easily
deconstruct it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Neither
Autarchs nor Omega Emperors would be capable of such a task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
realm truly is a mesmerizing one,” Iyerre murmured. “This realm
and all things within it should be mine to rule. These weaklings have
continued to bar my path. Now, I shall sweep them all away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Grassland World warped through spacetime one final time. By the
time it reappeared, Iyerre could now see the enormous Annihilation
Hive off in the distance, surrounded by that even-larger vortex which
was destroying and devouring all things around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the fourteen figures standing here were even more noticeable than the
vortex of destruction. Ning and his peers stood side-by-side, while
the seven avatars did the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fourteen calmly watched as that ovaloid object flew through space
towards them. The only person standing on the surface of the ovaloid
object was Iyerre, and he smiled thinly when he saw the fourteen. He
swept his gaze across them, then let out a chuckle which echoed
throughout spacetime: “No more running? No more hiding?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nowhere to run,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
give you what you want. We’re going to fight you to the death.”
Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
I hope you don’t piss yourself when you see our real power,”
Autarch Ekong said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
think he probably will piss himself,” Autarch Bolin smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all smiled or laughed as they spoke. Iyerre wasn’t
angered by this. He simply smiled back and nodded. “You natives are
quite brave.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_007__The"></A>
Chapter 7: Doll</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two sides stared at each other from far. They seemed relaxed, but the
atmosphere was already beginning to tense up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Talking won’t solve anything. Come and stop my Grassland World, if
you dare,” Iyerre said, then sank into the gray clouds and
vanished. At the same time, the ovaloid object transformed into a
streak of light and shot towards the vast behemoth hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning and the others traded glances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
vastly surpasses us in terms of insight. Now that he’s personally
in control of the Grassland World, no formation we can use would be
able to slow it down.” Autarch Titanos smiled. “The Grassland
World can enter the Annihilation Hive with ease, protecting it and
allowing it to continue devouring our Chaosverse’s energies. The
only way to stop it is to go inside of it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Charge
into the Grassland World and break it apart.” Autarch Bolin nodded
slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the only option. Gentlemen, let’s do this.” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
have to trouble you to lead us in this fight, Darknorth. We’ll need
your guidance for the Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan,” Autarch
Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can serve as the leader, but I’ll need all of your support.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
do this.” Ning and the others shared a few quick words, then began
to make their moves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The seven Autarchs and their seven avatars began to
simultaneously call upon the power of the Chaosverse, gathering it
around them to form vortexes of energy that quickly transformed into
a pair of towering titans! Both titans were nearly nude and clad only
in fur loin-cloths, but one had a slightly more powerful aura than
the other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan advanced side-by-side towards the
ovaloid object.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
appeared out of nowhere within the palace hidden deep within the
Grassland World. Flanking him was the silver-robed woman and the two
men, while below him stood the Sithe Exalts and the three
Autarch-class void dwellers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Vilesky,
you three come over here to the center,” Iyerre instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class void dwellers exchanged puzzled glances, then
nervously advanced to the center of the palace. The cyclopean bear,
the red-eyed white-furred humanoid, and the tentacled stormcloud
harbored distrust towards the Sithe, but unfortunately they were much
weaker than Iyerre. There was nothing they could do! In the Infinite
Void they were weaker than Iyerre, and even here in the Grassland
World they were still weaker than Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
native cultivators are about to attack. This shall be the final
battle.” Iyerre glanced down at the three void dwellers, then
smiled: “I’ll need you three to be prepared to make sacrifices
for our victory.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
tell us what you need us to do. We’ll do everything in our power,”
the three responded respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Excellent.”
Iyerre nodded. “What I need is for the three of you to offer me
your lives.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Surprise
appeared in the eyes of the cyclopean bear and the other two, only to
be quickly replaced by utter terror. Suddenly, nine violet-gold
chains appeared in the area around them. Each chain moved in an
abstruse and profound manner, and they howled through the air as they
lashed out at the three Autarch-class void dwellers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
what the hell are you doing?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Didn’t
you promise to give us our freedom if we helped you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
are you attacking us?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three void dwellers tried to fight back, but now that Iyerre was
personally controlling the violet-gold chains, the void dwellers were
vastly outclassed in both power and technique. The violet-gold chains
immediately began to land brutal blows on them, causing their bodies
to explode. The chains then quickly wrapped around their life-cores.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Sithe Exalts all watched in shocked silence. None of them
dared to say a word. They knew how ruthless Iyerre was. To him,
anyone and everyone was but a pawn to further his goals. The
‘promises’ those three Autarch-class void dwellers had believed
in were nothing more than jokes!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
you your freedom?” Iyerre stared down at them, his eyes flickering
coldly. “Did you three idiots really think you were qualified to
negotiate terms with me? If it wasn’t for the fact that I had a use
for you, I never would’ve let you remain alive for this long.”
Iyerre then reached out with his right hand, producing three
adorably-shaped black dolls. The three black dolls flew out to hover
directly above the center of the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hiss.
Hiss. Hiss. The shattered remnants of the void dwellers’ bodies
began to fly towards the black dolls. Even their life-cores, still
entangled by those chains, began to fly towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…
but… no!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class void dwellers suddenly felt a sensation of
infinite terror. Those ordinary looking dolls were exerting lethal
amounts of gravitational attraction, causing their life-cores to
uncontrollably fly towards them. Their splattered bits of blood and
flesh were also flying towards the black dolls, and as soon as they
touched the dolls they were swallowed up with a hiss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
you’ll definitely fail. You’ll fail!!!” a life-core with the
illusion of a cyclopean bear inside screamed frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
die! The cultivators will kill you all!” The life-core which was
filled with an illusion of a tentacled stormcloud was struggling and
braying as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
you, Iyerre! You are shameless!” the phantom of the red-eyed,
white-furred beast bellowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three life-cores flew towards the three black dolls, which
effortlessly devoured them as well as the flesh and blood from their
corpses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
couldn’t help but secretly feel amazed by this. “Master’s
skills in artifice are simply incredible. Those Autarch-class void
dwellers might be foolish, but their bodies are incredibly sturdy. It
is their bodies which gave them Autarch levels of power, but the
dolls were able to devour them with ease. I may also be an Omega
Autarch, but I’m far from being Master’s equal when it comes to
artifice.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
master was a Lord of Chaos. Although they were both Omega Autarchs,
Iyerre felt that his master remained superior to him in many
different areas!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how Bolin, Titanos, Mogg, and the others were all
Autarchs but shared different insights and were at different levels
of power. There was indeed a great difference in power between Iyerre
and his Master. The creation of the Annihilation Hive and the
Grassland World had only been possible because his master had
provided him guidance from behind the scenes. As for the black dolls,
his master had personally created these things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The three black dolls floating in midair suddenly began to
dramatically expand in size, transforming into a trio of towering
black scaled beasts which now lay on the ground. They pulsed with
auras of power but didn’t move in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Separate
into three squads as I previously instructed.” Iyerre glanced at
his other subordinates. The silver-robed woman, the black-robed man,
and the red-robed man immediately acknowledged the order while the
many Sithe Exalts quickly took up positions behind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
now on, each squad will be in charge of controlling one of these
machine warbeasts,” Iyerre said. “Although each has devoured the
full power of an Autarch-class void dweller, it will only be able to
fight at peak power for roughly one hour. Thus, we must achieve
victory as soon as possible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the silver-robed woman and the other two said. They had known all
along that this was going to happen. Indeed, the reason why Iyerre
had invited them to take part in this invasion was for them to
operate the machine warbeasts. Ordinary Exalts were a bit too weak to
truly unleash the potential of these things in battle. Each of the
three would control one, with the other Exalts providing assistance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
go,” Iyerre commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh!!! The silver-robed woman and the others quickly flew
inside the enormous machine warbeasts and took control of them. This
was a major trump card which their Lord of Chaos had bestowed upon
Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAAR!”
The three black warbeasts raised their heads and howled. Their auras
were actually stronger than those of the Autarch-class void dwellers,
because the machine warbeasts were burning up all of their power at a
rapid pace while holding nothing back. They could also attack with
marvelous techniques; they weren’t nearly as clumsy as those void
dwellers were!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are coming.” Iyerre raised his head to stare towards the skies. He
could see two towering giants wielding divine swords chop through the
grayish clouds as though the clouds were nothing more than rotted
wood. The two titans charged downwards, easily piercing through the
layers of clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
my orders.” A savage look appeared on Iyerre’s face. “Each of
you can only fight for an hour, so we need to do everything we can to
annihilate them during that period of time! This is the Grassland
World, a battlefield of our choosing. We’re definitely going to
win. Now go! Kill these cultivators!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. The three black warbeasts quickly warped
through space and disappeared from the temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Iyerre, his eyes were blazing as he barked, “Quintessence,
ignite!” Instantly, the quintessence core located deep within the
Grassland World once more began to erupt with power, filling every
inch of the entire world with tremendous might. The battle had just
begun, but everyone was already preparing to fight like a madman!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
disappeared from the palace, going forth to face his foes.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_008__The"></A>
Chapter 8: World of Liberation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan both continued to charge downwards.
Whoosh! Whoosh! The clouds had become much sturdier now that the
quintessence had been ignited, but before the might of Ji Ning’s
Sword Titan and Avatar Titan they remained unspeakably fragile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sword-light
flashed as they pierced straight through the clouds, charging all the
way down to the second layer of clouds. Right at this moment, they
all suddenly sensed danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning was the leader of this formation and was constantly on guard for
any possible movements. Suddenly, three enormous black warbeasts
appeared from the clouds nearby. They looked much like armor-clad
apes, but they each had a pair of curved horns on their heads. Their
knees were bent into a half-stooped position, and they stared
intently at the Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
the hell did these three come from?” Autarch Ekong sent mentally.
“All of them seem dangerous.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is probably one of the trump cards the Sithe have been hiding the
entire time. Now that the last battle has begun, they no longer see a
need to hide themselves,” Titanos sent back. “These three beasts
have odd auras. Be careful, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die,
cultivators!” The three warbeasts attacked simultaneously, first
surrounding the nearby Avatar Titan. The Avatar Titan lifted up his
twin swords, ready to meet their attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
furious claw-strikes of the warbeasts caused the very heavens to
darken as they lashed out with overwhelming power towards the Avatar
Titan. In turn, the Avatar Titan swept out with his right hand,
generating an ephemeral streak of sword-light in the air which struck
out at the warbeast. Whoosh! The sword-light immediately retracted,
while the warbeast simply howled and continued to press the attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
three machine warbeasts are extremely powerful.” Ning and the
others were all shocked. “They’re actually able to fight our
Avatar Titan to a standstill. Our sword-arts will only be enough to
hold off two of them at most.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
The three warbeasts fought with uncommon ferocity. Clearly, they
wanted to destroy this weaker-looking titan as soon as they could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The nearby Sword Titan had already charged over, sending an awesome
stream of sword-light slashing through the air with unstoppable
force. One of the warbeasts immediately used both of its paws to
block this attack head-on. Both combatants had extremely marvelous
techniques, but an explosion rang out as soon as the paws struck
against the horizontal sword-strike. The warbeast was sent flying
backwards, and it only managed to catch its footing after flying a
million kilometers backwards. Then, it once more charged over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is extremely strong, and its scales are just as tough as the black
tower which houses the sphere of annihilation. There’s no way to
injure it at all.” Ning was secretly alarmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang!!! A series of clanking sounds could be heard as one
violet-gold chain after another began to appear. They were like great
serpents which blotted out the skies, emanating auras of awesome
power as they swept out towards the weaker Avatar Titan and sought to
destroy it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
chains aren’t that dangerous.” Ning didn’t worry too much about
them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three black warbeasts and the nine violet-gold chains continued to
furiously assault the Avatar Titan, but the Avatar Titan and the
Sword Titan fought alongside each other. The Sword Titan was
especially mighty, with each of its blows sending the black warbeasts
flying with ease and making it impossible for them to gain a true
advantage over the Avatar Titan. The warbeasts truly were rather
troublesome, as their techniques were brilliant and they were
completely impervious to damage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning, Titanos, and the others suddenly sensed a new threat
approaching. They hurriedly turned to look towards the skies, only to
see the figure of Iyerre appear. Iyerre’s robes were fluttering
around him, and his body was covered by an awesome aura of power
formed from the energies released by the ignited quintessence core.
He was currently diving downwards head first, his hands folded in a
prayer position before him. An absolutely dazzling stream of golden
light was emanating from between his hands, preparing to spread
outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omnipresent…
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
almost instantly illuminated the entire Grassland World. The light
was blinding, and it weighed down heavily upon both the Sword Titan
and the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
Iyerre changed his stance, pulling back his left hand while pushing
out with his right. He had once used this technique against Mogg, but
now that he was using the ignited quintessence core’s power this
strike was now much stronger than before. When fighting Mogg, he had
to spend quite a bit of time to accumulate the amount of energy
necessary. This time, he was quite fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
isn’t all that powerful, but he’s at such a high level of insight
that he can employ his energies to terrifying effect.” Ning
immediately made the Sword Titan to slice upwards with a sword,
blocking Iyerre’s downwards palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
This unfathomably powerful palm crashed head-on against the
all-encompassing sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
staggered a few steps backwards, a frown on his face: “This
formation-giant is incredibly strong. Darknorth is making perfect use
of these native cultivators’ powers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
The Sword Titan had been able to block Iyerre with ease. Even when
Iyerre was using his most powerful strike, he was only 30% more
powerful than the machine warbeasts. It wasn’t enough to threaten
the Sword Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Light!”
Boom! Iyerre began to glow with even more dazzling light. The light
was everywhere, filling the entire world with an iridescent glow.
What worried Ning the most… was that he could no longer find
Iyerre! After releasing that blast of infinite light, Iyerre had
actually vanished into the light itself. Ning could neither see him
physically nor track him via godsense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
an alabaster arm reached out to grab at the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
Iyerre!” The Avatar Titan hurriedly moved to block. Since Ning was
controlling both titans, he was able to make them work in perfect
concert. The Sword Titan immediately went over to help out as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dazzling light continued to suppress both the titans, while Iyerre
launched one sneak attack after another with incomparably profound
techniques. Blocking his attacks was very taxing, and eventually one
would get through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone,
prepare the World of Liberation,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Titanos, Mogg, and the others all knew that the moment had come. They
had been planning to save this trump card for use at a critical
moment, but they were now at such a disadvantage that they were
finding it hard to even maintain their defenses. It was too hard for
the Sword Titan to defend against the warbeasts, the chains, and
Iyerre at the same time. The Avatar Titan was in tremendous danger
right now, and once it was destroyed their foes would be free to
focus their attacks against the Sword Titan. When that happened, the
situation would become even grimmer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
six surges of power shot out simultaneously. Golden bridges began to
appear directly beneath the feet of the Sword Titan and the Avatar
Titan. It was the Golden Bridges of Freedom! The six Golden Bridges
of Freedom joined together into a hexagonal shape, forming a single
complete edifice! They began to accumulate awesome amounts of power
from the Chaosverse that surpassed even the power of the ignited
Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that the Golden Bridges of Freedom were modeled
off the Daoguard Towers. They were able to accumulate and make use of
large amounts of the Chaosverse’s energies. Once they linked
together, they were able to use even more!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“WORLD
STANCE!” Ning roared. This was the only domain-type stance he had
created for the fusion sword-arts – the World stance!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
Ning, Titanos, Bolin, Skyfeeder, Mogg, Stonerule, and Ekong began to
simultaneously unleash their respective domains. Autarch Bolin
actually unleashed two domains, one for the Claw Daobirth Essence and
one for the Samsara Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he was responsible for controlling and unleashing the
Eternal Omega Sword Dao Domain!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
eight domains came together, drawing upon the power of the Chaosverse
as well as the power of the golden bridges themselves!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
‘Omega Sword Dao Domain’ was able to perfectly connect together
all of these different domains, allowing the different types of power
to merge together into dazzling streams of sword-light. The entire
world became filled with countless streams of sword-light, each of
which was formed from a different type of domain-energy. The power of
this domain vastly surpassed Iyerre’s domain of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is…” Iyerre and the warbeasts felt as though countless streams of
sword-light had enveloped them and were pressing down on them,
forcing them to resist it with every single movement they made.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
eight different types of domain-energy and the power from the Golden
Bridges of Freedom have been perfectly joined together to form this
domain – the World of Liberation.” Ning and the others were all
excited. As soon as the ‘World of Liberation’ domain was
released, Iyerre and the others were dramatically weakened. Even the
nine violet-gold chains were weakened significantly, and as a result
Ning and the others immediately gained the upper hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Join
forces to kill Iyerre! Once Iyerre dies, those three indestructible
warbeasts will begin to fall apart on their own,” Titanos sent
mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
Iyerre!” Bolin barked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
Their eyes were filled with murder. The three warbeasts had been
suppressed by their domain, reducing them to 70% of their normal
power. Even if all of them joined forces against the Avatar Titan, it
would still be able to defend against them using the Cavebright
stance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the powerful Sword Titan, it had only one target: Iyerre!</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

Chapter 9: Death Battle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan charged incredibly fast towards Iyerre, whose face
tightened. Even before the World of Liberation domain had started to
suppress him, he wouldn’t have dared to fight the Sword Titan in
sole combat. Now that he only had around 60% of his full power, he
would probably be destroyed in just ten strikes if he tried to fight
the thing head-on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe these natives have actually forced me to do this.”
Iyerre immediately took a step forwards, vanishing into thin air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
The Sword Titan’s greatsword chopped through where Iyerre had just
been, hitting nothing but air. Ji Ning, Bolin, Titanos, and the
others were secretly infuriated by this. However, even in the outside
world Iyerre was able to disengage from battle as he pleased. Here in
the Grassland World, it was even easier for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
he’s fled, let’s first capture those three warbeasts then destroy
the Grassland World’s core. Without the Grassland World and the
three warbeasts, Iyerre won’t be able to cause much trouble.”
Ning and the others all knew that Iyerre wasn’t able to summon much
power due to the local Chaosverse suppressing him. He had to create
and use powerful treasures in order to pose a threat to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
the more powerful the treasure, the greater the cost to make it. It
had taken Iyerre aeons to construct the Grassland World and the
Annihilation Hive. If they managed to destroy the Grassland World, it
would be ages before Iyerre would be able to challenge them again. By
then, the cultivators would have grown far more powerful than they
were right now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Sword Titan gripped the Northbow sword in both hands as it
charged towards one of the warbeasts. Although they were
indestructible, capturing them was still a possibility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaaar!”
“Gwaaaaar!” “Gwaaaaar!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three black warbeasts separated, moving in three different
directions. Suddenly, all of them raised their heads, causing a
strange black-white glyph to appear from their foreheads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan both turned to stare upwards at
the figure which had just appeared above them. It was Iyerre, who had
disappeared just moments ago. Iyerre’s forehead also had a
black-white glyph emanating from it. Countless strands of black and
white light reached out, piercing through the air and connecting
Iyerre to all three of the warbeasts. Together, they formed an
incredibly marvelous formation which transformed Iyerre and the three
warbeasts into one being!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
energy leaking out from the ignited quintessence core was being
sucked up into this enormous formation, while the energies of the
three warbeasts were also being rapidly consumed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
and the three black warbeasts began to glow with blurry black-white
light, and their auras increased dramatically in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe these natives have actually forced me to use my last
trump card.” Iyerre gritted his teeth. In the end, this final
battle had surpassed Iyerre’s expectations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
had believed that with the battle being held within the Grassland
World, the combined forces of himself, the three warbeasts, and the
violet-gold chains would be more than enough to gain victory! Alas,
Ning had first created an even more powerful sword-art with an extra
Daobirth Essence in it, then unleashed the suppressive power of the
World of Liberation domain. All this had forced Iyerre to unveil his
very last card! He had truly gone all-out now, with nothing held
back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
master had been the one to create the black warbeasts! When they
fought individually, they weren’t all that powerful, but when
merged together into a single whole they were able to unleash their
true power. This was why his master had also bestowed the Yin-Yang
Formation upon him, allowing him to perfectly join together with
those three beasts. However, this would cause the three warbeasts to
run out of power even more quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
Iyerre was above them while the three warbeasts circled around them.
The four all glowed with unearthly halos of black-white light, and
countless strands linked them together as they charged towards the
Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The Sword Titan and Iyerre exchanged blows. The result was that
Iyerre was knocked flying backwards, but he quickly regrouped and
charged forward once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually become so much more powerful!” Ning, Titanos, and the
others were all shocked. The World of Liberation was suppressing
Iyerre, but he had still skyrocketed in power to reach 70% of the
Sword Titan’s might! Given his profound insights, he was now
completely capable of sustained combat against the Sword Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
even he has become so powerful, then what of those three warbeasts?”
Ning and the others knew that the situation had just taken a turn for
the worse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The Avatar Titan was being surrounded and besieged. He
used his sword-arts to defend and exclusively focused on using the
most defensive stance, the Cavebright stance. He instantly used this
stance fifteen times in a row, but he was already in an extremely
dangerous situation. The Sword Titan immediately brandished his
sword, moving to reinforce the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha!
Native cultivators, you are doomed. All of you will die. None of you
will escape!” Iyerre went forth to help destroy the Avatar Titan as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
situation had instantly turned extremely grim. Even though the World
of Liberation weighed down upon the Sithe, the Sithe had the
unquestioned upper hand. Just two seconds later, the two titans were
in an extremely disadvantageous situation despite working together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t let this continue. If we just defend, we’ll definitely
lose. We probably won’t be able to last for ten more seconds before
the Avatar Titan is torn asunder. Once that happens, the Sword Titan
will be swarmed and destroyed as well. We’ll lose this fight!”
They all understood this, which was why they were all extremely
anxious. However, they had already used everything they had. It was
incredible that they had reached this current level of power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing we can do. Let’s go all-in.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
all-in.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All-in.”
Bolin, Mogg, Stonerule, Ekong, Skyfeeder, Titanos, and Ning all
shared this exact same thought. Whoosh! Their bodies suddenly began
to glow with light as a terrifying aura of power began to spread out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that their bodies were completely formed of mana.
Consequently, their bodies contained absolutely astonishing stores of
energy. Hegemons and Emperors who were gripped by despair would
choose to self-detonate, precisely because the sudden release of such
an enormous amount of energy would generate an absolutely incredible
explosion. Back during the Endwar of the Three Realms, many Immortals
and Fiendgods had sacrificed themselves via self-detonation to deal
Old Man Yuan a fatal blow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was an Omega Emperor, while the other six were Autarchs. They
wouldn’t choose to self-detonate, as self-detonation might not even
be enough to kill someone like Iyerre, who was extremely skilled at
staying alive. If the seven of them died while Iyerre survived, they
would have lost this war!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as importantly, at their current level of insight these seven had
exquisitely perfect control over their bodies. Self-detonation would
simply result in the explosion scattering energy out haphazardly. It
was a fairly foolish choice, and they had chosen something else: to
transform a portion of their bodies into raw power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the Autarchs had chosen to sacrifice parts of their flesh and
blood! Their bodies began to glow with light as a terrifying amount
of power began to burst forth from them! In normal battle, it was
easy for them to unleash ten thousand strikes because they were able
to replenish as much energy as they used. Now, however, all of them
suffered severe self-inflicted wounds because they had used up more
than half of the energy which had been stored in their bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was an absolute maximum. If they burned away even more energy, their
damaged truesouls would no longer be able to maintain perfect control
over this level of power. Every single speck of mana was infused with
their souls and truesouls, after all! If they lost too much, their
truesouls would weaken to the point where they could no longer
maintain control. Only by maintaining perfect control would they be
able to unleash truly awesome levels of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the most ideal, suitable time for taking such a risk… but they
could only do so a single time! This was because they would all be so
heavily wounded after this strike that they would have merely 40% of
their strength remaining. There was no way they could duplicate this
attack, and so it truly was their final, last-gasp attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to win.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Autarch Bolin’s entire body glowed with light as his severed flesh
and blood transformed into raw power. He was able to maintain control
over it, causing it to swirl around him instead of exploding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Prepare
to die,” Autarch Ekong roared, his body surrounded by the awesome
energies of the Destruction Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Skyfeeder,
Mogg, Stonerule, Titanos, and the others all controlled their own
energies as well. As for Ning, he drew upon the incredible power of
his Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you, DIE!” The Sword Titan’s aura suddenly skyrocketed in
might, causing the entire Grassland World to quiver. The amount of
energy generated by seven Autarchs sacrificing more than half of
their bodies was simply too enormous. They only guided a tiny portion
of it into the World of Liberation, but the domain’s power
instantly skyrocketed! Boom! Boom! Boom! Countless rays of
sword-light came pressing down, crushing the clouds below them into
dust and even crushing the grasslands at the very bottom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The Grassland World had been so completely suppressed by the
sword-light, it was like a giant invisible hand had just caved it in
by a layer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was nothing more than a tiny, tiny amount of the energy the seven had
just unleashed. They were keeping control over the rest of the power
and preparing to use it to unleash a truly terrifying blow. This was
the absolute maximum amount of power their damaged truesouls could
control perfectly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
could feel that death was coming for him. When he saw how terrifying
this explosive aura before him was, he didn’t even think about
trying to defend against it head-on. “This is probably the final
desperation strike these cultivators have up their sleeves. There’s
no way they would be able to launch a second such attack. If I can
avoid this one, I’ll have won.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Withdraw!”
Iyerre commanded. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Iyerre and the
three warbeasts retreated simultaneously, vanishing within the void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Foolish
cultivators, this is the Grassland World. This is our chosen
battlefield!” Iyerre’s voice rang out within the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are the fools!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Imbeciles!”
Ning and Ekong let out furious retorts in succession, their voices
echoing within the heavens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! The Avatar Titan and the Sword Titan charged downwards
simultaneously, smashing into the grasslands. As soon as they did,
they instantly blinked deep within its depths.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_010__The"></A>
Chapter 10: Tit For Tat</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
they entered the depths of the Grassland World, they quickly saw a
spiderweb of countless passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
An awesome domain filled every single passageway with countless
streams of sword-light. The World of Liberation’s power blew
through every single formation like rotting wood, crushing all
barriers in its path! It must be remembered that even before Ji Ning
and the others had gone all-out, they had been able to reduce Iyerre
and the others by 30% to 40% of their maximum power. Now that the
Autarchs had gone all-out, the World of Liberation was so incredibly
powerful that it was able to almost instantly crush ordinary Autarchs
to death!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
the nine layers of clouds were completely unable to block this
intensity of energy, much less the barrier formations deep inside the
grasslands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
found it. The quintessence core for this world lies in that palace
over there.” Thanks to the World of Liberation, Ning and the others
were able to sense a completely sealed castle located at the very
bottom of the Grassland World. The castle was roughly ten thousand
kilometers in size, and all of the energy emanating from the
Grassland World actually stemmed from this castle. They could clearly
sense how the deep, dense azure aura covering the castle was
constantly being dispersed in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can destroy the quintessence core, Iyerre and the others will be
dramatically weakened! Those three warbeasts won’t be able to
escape us.” They immediately transformed into a streak of light,
bursting through the chaotic passageways and moving closer-and-closer
to the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was able to dodge with ease because of his high level of insight, but
the three warbeasts were only able to dodge because of the power of
the Grassland World. The Sithe in charge of the black warbeasts had
insights which were merely on par with Ning’s. In Ning’s
Chaosverse, their escape techniques were far inferior to Ning’s! So
long as the Autarchs could destroy the Grassland World, they would
then be able to defeat and capture the three warbeasts one by one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
Iyerre was the only one left, he’d be much easier to deal with! But
of course… all this was only possible if they destroyed the
Grassland World!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dammit!”
When Iyerre sensed the Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan moving at
high speed towards the quintessence, he immediately grew anxious.
“How are they able to stay in control of all that power and prevent
it from exploding?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
someone was filled with too much power, there would be no way to
maintain control of it. They would have to immediately release it in
the form of an attack. However, Ning and the others had already
thought of this problem. They only discarded 60% of their bodies,
rather than 90% as they originally envisioned. The resulting levels
of energy were just barely within the realms of what they could
control; they could release it or retract it at will. Although it was
much weaker than the pure destructive power which would be generated
by sacrificing more in a one-shot attack, it allowed for an attack
that they could aim and control. In the end, the latter was much more
dangerous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
what should we do? Are we going to just watch as they destroy the
Grassland World’s quintessence? Once they do, we probably won’t
be able to beat them,” the red-robed man sent mentally. They had a
huge advantage right now, but this was in large part due to the
strengthening effect of the ignited quintessence core. The formation
they were using also required them to draw upon the energies of the
ignited quintessence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
go go go go! Go stop them!” Iyerre roared. “Stop them at any
cost!” The core of the Annihilation Hive was the sphere of
annihilation, which contained the mysteries of total destruction. It
was extremely hard to destroy. The core of the Grassland World,
however, was just a normal quintessence which would be much easier to
annihilate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Iyerre and the three warbeasts easily warped
over to the outsides of the core castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are about to arrive!” Iyerre and the others stared at the dark
passageways before them. A terrifying aura was beginning to approach
those dark passageways. The area had long ago been filled with the
power of countless streams of sword-light, but the sword-light wasn’t
strong enough to claim their lives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is way too much power. Way too much!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
we possibly stop them?” The silver-robed woman, her two colleagues,
and the many Sithe Exalts all felt their hearts tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can and you must. If we lose, the cultivators will not spare you. All
of you will die!” Iyerre gritted his teeth, his eyes savage. The
most critical moments had arrived. “And these three warbeasts were
personally fashioned by my master. Not even I have the power to
destroy them, much less these cultivators.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
others calmed down slightly upon hearing this. They were filled with
absolute, blind faith in Iyerre’s master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
they are!” Iyerre and the others all felt their hearts clench as
those two towering figures emerged from the dark passageways. The
Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan flew out right next to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
Iyerre and his lackeys. I knew they wouldn’t just watch as we
destroyed the quintessence.” Ning and the others knew that the
moment of truth had arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Charge!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break
into that castle at all costs!” Ning and the others didn’t
hesitate at all. The Avatar Titan took the lead while the Sword Titan
brought up the rear as they charged towards the castle. As long as
they were able to touch it, they would be able to blink inside it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
them!” Iyerre roared ferociously. One violet-gold chain after
another began to dance defensively in front of the castle, while all
three black warbeasts charged in unison to block the Sword Titan and
the Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fuck
off!” The Avatar Titan’s job was to clear the way, but the
violet-gold chains were being controlled in an absolutely marvelous
fashion by Iyerre. They all parted before the Avatar Titan, coiling
behind it to strike at the Sword Titan! Iyerre and the others all
knew that the Avatar Titan wasn’t that great of a threat. The true
threat remained the Sword Titan, which was in command of an enormous
amount of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grow,
grow, grow!” The three black warbeasts suddenly expanded
dramatically in size. The tunnels weren’t that large, and their
sudden increase in size resulted in them filling up much of the
tunnel with their bulk. If Ning and the others wanted to reach the
castle, they would have to first defeat these clawed terrors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we have to fight them, we’ll go ahead and destroy all three of
them!” The Sword Titan wielded a longsword in each hand, lifting
them up while the seven inside of it began to unleash the prodigious
power which they had been keeping in abeyance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The right sword sliced out, chopping towards the three black
warbeasts which sought to bar the titan’s path. The power contained
within this sword caused spacetime itself to disintegrate. There was
nothing which could impede this terrifying strike! All three
warbeasts were utterly terrified by the might of this blow, while
Iyerre gritted his teeth and prayed, “They have to block them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
When the divine sword slammed against the body of the first warbeast,
it suddenly transformed to become as soft as silk. It twisted,
seeking to wrap itself over the black warbeast and bind it. The black
warbeast, however, transformed to become a black liquid which the
sword could not bind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want to capture it? Do you think the most powerful machine warbeasts
my master created would be so easily captured by the likes of you?”
the distant Iyerre laughed coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs instantly understood that there was no way to capture them,
and so they immediately changed strategies. “Destroy them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! The two divine swords were filled with ineffable power as
they came crashing down towards the three beasts. It must be
remembered that even an ‘invulnerable form’ would be destroyed if
the amount of power facing it surpassed the limits of its tolerance!
These three black warbeasts were currently forced to face the full,
absolute might of this twin-attack from the dominating Sword Titan!
The black warbeasts were extremely tough. They weren’t the
slightest bit injured, and in fact they were able to deflect 99% of
the concussive force… but that remaining 1% entered its body and
reduced the Sithe Exalts it encountered to dust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhh!”
Bowenya and the others only felt an overwhelming amount of power pass
through them, followed by their bodies completely disintegrating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom!!! The three black warbeasts were sent flying backwards
and smashed into the walls of the passageway. They were physically
unharmed but filled with dead Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thanks
to the local formations, Iyerre was able to clearly see what the
situation was inside the three black warbeasts. The three powerful
allies he had half-coaxed, half-forced to come had been able to
withstand that terrifying blast. However, all of the Sithe Exalts in
the first and second warbeasts, which had taken the brunt of the
strikes, had been slain! Three Sithe Exalts had died in the third
warbeast as well. Now, only his three allies and five Sithe Exalts
were remaining.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Crunch! Crunch! Crunch! The nine violet-gold chains had worked
together with the black warbeasts to defend against this attack. Two
of the chains actually blew apart! The Sword Titan shrank in size,
seeking to fly through the gap, but the remaining chains flew over to
block it once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!”
Iyerre’s loud laughter echoed throughout the passageway. Ning and
the others were anxious, nervous, and resentful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have lost! LOST!” Iyerre roared with laughter. “That last-gasp
desperation attack was very powerful, but both the warbeasts and the
chains are completely fearless. You weren’t able to destroy them
and blast open a route to the castle!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was true. That final, frenzied strike had not done what they needed
it to do – clear a path to the castle! Ning and the others gritted
their teeth. Those warbeasts were simply too difficult to deal with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
three warbeasts are finished. You are the only one left. You are the
one who has lost, Sithe.” The Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan
charged straight towards Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
said they are finished?” Iyerre let out a loud laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! The three black warbeasts once more flew over to
block in front of Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black warbeasts were under the control of Iyerre’s three powerful
allies. The Sithe Exalts merely provided additional support.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others stared at the untouched Iyerre as well as the three
enormous black warbeasts. Their hearts grew cold. As soon as they had
witnessed the black warbeasts rise up once more, they had already
begun to feel a sense of despair. Those things were still
battle-worthy? How was this even possible?</P>

Chapter 11: Truly Unbearable</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
seven dancing violet-gold chains and the three warbeasts were
charging towards them once more. Ji Ning and the other Autarchs had
already used up the massive energy they had gained from sacrificing
parts of their bodies. Even the power of the World of Liberation had
dropped back down to its normal level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Bang! The Sword Titan used its sword-arts to defend against the three
black warbeasts simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
of the warbeasts is just as strong as it was previously, while the
other two still have 80% power.” Ning quickly came to this
conclusion after clashing against them once more, and it turned their
hearts cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
smiled coldly as he watched from behind, launching attacks towards
the weaker Avatar Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”
Ning and the others didn’t hesitate at all, quickly coming to this
decision. Iyerre and the three warbeasts were as one thanks to the
formation, and all four were incredibly strong. This was why Ning and
the others had been forced to sacrifice parts of their bodies to
launch a final desperation attack… but it had failed! If they were
truly forced to fight the Avatar Titan would probably be defeated in
short order, at which point the Sword Titan wouldn’t be far off
from defeat either. As of right now, they had only one chance to
survive – escape!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Escape
the Grassland World, run far away, and recover! Once they did so,
they could come back here to fight again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! The Sword Titan and the Avatar Titan both began to flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Running?
After all that’s happened, you still think you can escape?”
Iyerre grinned coldly. He was effortlessly dominating the Avatar
Titan with the help of the seven violet-gold chains, while the three
black warbeasts continued to chase down the Sword Titan. “Stop
struggling. Struggling won’t help you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre’s
body began to emit tremendous amounts of dazzling light which filled
every single passageway. He himself vanished without a trace, hiding
within the light while he continued to furiously assault the Avatar
Titan. The Avatar Titan was just barely able to hold on, thanks to
his defensive sword-arts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
Iyerre outstripped the Avatar Titan in terms of power, and he had a
higher level of insight as well! Given that he also had seven
violet-gold chains helping him while he launched sneak attacks from
hiding, it only took six seconds before Iyerre managed to land a
knife-hand blow on the Avatar Titan, plunging it into the titan’s
body and causing the avatars inside to feel a sense of despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiip!
The towering Iyerre used his two hands to physically rip the Avatar
Titan in half. Ning and the other avatars shared a glance, then
simultaneously made the same decision without any hesitation at all:
self-detonation!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! All seven avatars exploded simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
worry was that when Iyerre killed them, he would use karma to route
the attacks against their true bodies as well! Autarch Bolin and
Autarch Titanos were able to completely cut themselves off from all
karmic ties, but what of the others? If Iyerre wasn’t reinforced by
this formation his karmic attacks probably wouldn’t be a threat to
them, but he was currently strengthened by both the ignited
quintessence core and his link to the three warbeasts. Ning and the
others didn’t dare to take this risk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
clean end.” Iyerre turned to glance upwards. “But it won’t
matter. Struggle all you want. You are doomed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
He took a step forwards, warping through space before appearing in
front of the Sword Titan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan was frantically trying to flee, but the three black
warbeasts continued to slow him down, preventing him from travelling
at maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
warbeasts are indestructible and can warp through spacetime to block
us.” Ning and the others felt anxious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
almost there.” Whoosh. They finally reached the grassy surface once
more, at which point the Sword Titan blinked out to the clouds above.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!”
Iyerre’s loud laughter rang out. The Sword Titan raised his head,
the seven all watching as Iyerre emerged out of nowhere and appeared
in the skies. Iyerre said with a laugh, “There are nine layers of
clouds here. It will take you so very, very long to fly through all
these layers that I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
Ning and the others all knew that Iyerre was far more difficult to
deal with than those three black warbeasts, because of how high his
level of insight was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Escaping
is our only chance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
give it our all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
everything we can to escape.” Titanos, Mogg, Ning, Bolin, Ekong,
Stonerule, and Skyfeeder all knew that they had to get out of here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Twin swords in hand, the Sword Titan began to soar toward the clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you really think you can escape?” Iyerre charged downwards,
surrounded by seven violet-gold chains that stretched out a million
kilometers. Space rippled behind him, followed by the three black
warbeasts appearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The Sword Titan immediately arced sideways in a bid to avoid them,
but the seemingly-omnipresent violet-gold chains still managed to
appear in front of them, as did Iyerre and the three warbeasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang! Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sword Titan used its sword-arts to battle against Iyerre and the
three black warbeasts while continuing to soar towards the clouds in
the skies. Although the three black warbeasts were extremely strong,
they didn’t pose too much of a threat because they were merely on
par with Ning and the others in terms of insight. Ning was able to
use his self-created fusion sword-arts to block all three of them…
but Iyerre was much more dangerous! Iyerre’s attacks caught Ning
flat-footed time and time again. Blocking his attacks was a much more
difficult proposition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
didn’t even need to fear the Sword Titan in solo combat, much less
now when he had the three black warbeasts helping to slow the titan
down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we just keep defending, we’re going to lose. We have to escape!”
Ning and the Autarchs couldn’t see any chance of winning this
battle. Their only chance lay in escape. If they got out of here,
they just might end up the victors after all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Spacetime was shattered throughout the Grassland World,
with the Five Elements thrown into a state of chaos as the Sword
Titan continued to charge upwards while being surrounded and
bombarded with attacks by the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The power of the World of Liberation, by itself, was enough to tear
through the clouds. The Sword Titan charged upwards through the
opening, but Iyerre and the black warbeasts continued to press the
attack against him. Iyerre was like a patient hunter, continuing to
harass his prey while searching for the perfect opportunity. Ning and
the others felt as though they had daggers pressed against their
backs. Every single attack Iyerre launched was incredibly dangerous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to hold until we get out! We have to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
holding!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos
and the rest quietly prayed. It was now up to Ning. Ning was in
control of the entire Sword Titan, and he used it to execute his
sword-arts. This was an extremely taxing fight! The three black
warbeasts had insights on par with his, while Iyerre’s insights
were far more profound. It was already impressive for him to maintain
an airtight defense, but they really couldn’t afford to let
themselves be beaten here. If they lost, it would all be over!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The Sword Titan charged past the second layer of clouds, continuing
its upwards ascent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Ning paled as Iyerre managed to snake a palm past the Sword
Titan’s defensive sword-stances. Ning didn’t hesitate,
immediately discarding the Northbow sword in his left hand and using
his hand instead to launch a sword-art. Boom! He managed to block
Iyerre’s palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
actually blocked it?” Iyerre had thought he was about to win. He
couldn’t help but feel slightly startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the Sword Titan was knocked flying backwards, yet another Northbow
sword appeared in his left hand. Ning had a total of six Northbow
swords, after all! As for the one he had discarded, it had flown back
to below the Golden Bridges of Freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The Sword Titan burst through the third layer of clouds. However, as
it did so a ghostly and gigantic palm once more burst past Ning’s
defenses. This time, Ning was completely unable to react. The palm
slammed into the left side of the Sword Titan’s waist, with the
Sword Titan unable to block even with his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“NO!!!!”
Ning, Titanos, Bolin, and the others all watched in shock. Time
itself seemed to have slowed down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
The alabaster fingers pierced deep into the Sword Titan’s flank,
stabbing straight through it. Then, as though it could sense the
Autarchs, it reached out towards the nearest person inside –
Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg wanted to block… but how could he?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
We can’t lose!” Tears appeared in Autarch Mogg’s face. Bang!
The giant alabaster hand stabbed into him, filling every inch of his
body with a burst of such overwhelming power that every last speck of
mana within it began to crumble from the force of the strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
He was completely obliterated. Not even a scrap of his truesoul
fragments was able to return to this Chaosverse. Everything had been
devoured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
With Mogg’s death, the entire Sword Titan began to destabilize.
Iyerre tore at the insides of the Sword Titan with his alabaster
hand, ripping a gaping wound through the Sword Titan’s chest and to
its shoulders, nearly cleaving the titan in half.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
them!” Iyerre’s voice was filled with intoxicated glee as well as
a boundless desire for his foes to die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
The three black warbeasts grew excited as well. They were about to
win! They all pounced down towards the already-crumbling Sword Titan,
while Iyerre himself began to launch an attack as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t lose.” Ning desperately tried to make the Sword Titan wield
the Northbow sword and block, but without Mogg the power of their
sword-arts dropped dramatically. There was no way for him to stop
Iyerre, whose attack once more dug deep into the Sword Titan’s
body. This time, he managed to latch onto Autarch Skyfeeder. Light
glowed around his palm, and Autarch Skyfeeder was similarly unable to
defend against him. The end result was destruction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
it all!” Autarch Skyfeeder stared into the skies, filled with
despair and resentment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Upon her death, the Sword Titan’s body crumbled apart as well. Now
that they had lost two Autarchs, the Sword Titan was no longer able
to stay intact. Ning, Titanos, and the others began to instinctively
flee despite their despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!”
A black warbeast pounced forwards, clawing at Autarch Stonerule’s
back. Autarch Stonerule was absolutely agonized. “Why? Why? WHY!”
BOOM! Autarch Stonerule was annihilated as well, his truesoul
fragments completely devoured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to flee, his heart feeling as though it was being cut apart
by countless knives. All he could do was watch as one of his friends
after another was killed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t lose. We really can’t lose!” Countless figures flashed
through Ning’s mind. This Chaosverse was filled with innumerable
living beings. Ning’s friends… his disciples… his family
members… the hard-working cultivators he knew… there were
countless people in this Chaosverse, part of whom he knew and part of
whom he didn’t.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had lost. Their entire civilization was about to be overthrown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
sorry.” Autarch Titanos didn’t struggle. He simply shut his eyes,
two streams of tears cascading down his face as he transformed
himself into a plume of light. However, the black warbeast’s sharp
claws reached out, still managing to capture and devour all the
truesoul fragments and prevent them from returning to the
Quintessence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wipe
them all out!” Iyerre roared with laughter. “Kill them all! Drown
their entire civilization with blood! This Chaosverse is MINE!
IYERRE’S! AHAHAHA!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
then… the entire Grassland World seemed to have fallen silent. All
other auras were completely suppressed, while Iyerre’s laughter
became frozen as well. He suddenly turned to stare at the
sword-bearing white-robed youth. Two streams of tears were cascading
down the youth’s face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
ripple of pure ‘blackness’ swept out from Ning’s body. That
utterly black ripple contained an utterly terrifying will of
destruction. This was true destruction, a will which would obliterate
any and all things. Nothing and no one could withstand this type of
oblivion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed youth opened his eyes, and within those eyes they could
see the annihilation of an entire Chaosverse.</P>

Chapter 12: Oblivion Sword Dao</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning saw the Sword Titan shatter, then saw Autarch Mogg, Autarch
Stonerule, Autarch Skyfeeder, and Autarch Titanos all perish in
battle. Even he himself was about to die. Ning’s heart was filled
with resentment and an unwillingness to accept this all. He was
filled with remorse towards all the living beings of this Chaosverse,
filled with remorse towards his daughter. I’m really sorry,
everyone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
felt resentment, pain, remorse… and boundless hate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
he saw the maniacally laughing Iyerre, Ning felt true hatred. To use
a common saying from his first life in China on Earth, ‘even after
dying and becoming a ghost, he still wouldn’t forgive or spare
Iyerre’! However, in his heart he knew that once he died, his
truesoul fragments would be completely swallowed and devoured. All
that hatred he felt was completely meaningless! It was precisely
because he understood this that the hatred and agony in Ning’s
heart was only further heightened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hatred!
Hatred aimed at himself for being too weak!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hatred!
Hatred aimed at himself for being unable to protect those he cared
about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
truly did want to annihilate all of these invaders!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boundless
hatred filled his heart. He didn’t want to die. Titanos, Mogg…
they had felt the same way. They had died with their eyes open. Death
held no release for them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
powerful will of hatred caused all of Ning’s thoughts, his very
consciousness itself, to become completely transformed into just one
thing – an overwhelming desire to kill! An insatiable desire to
destroy! As this completely unprecedented desire for destruction
filled him, all of the questions and confusion Ning felt towards the
Oblivion Sword Dao were completely wiped clean. Everything came to
its logical conclusion, resulting in the Oblivion Sword Dao taking a
complete and perfect form within Ning’s mind!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is what ‘true destruction’ is. I always felt that I was
lacking a little spark when it came to understanding it, preventing
my version of it from being the real thing. So this is what I
lacked.” Finally, Ning completely understood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power of pure darkness rippled out from Ning. It held the interlinked
Five Elements, the transformations of Yin and Yang, both Light and
Dark, and both Space and Time. They were all connected to each other
by the binds of Karma… and the karmic links that existed between
them were formed by Ning’s pure, destructive intent! All of them
were being destroyed by Ning’s will, resulting in a chain reaction
that came together to form ‘Oblivion’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
had actually built up enough insight long ago, and even my overall
path was correct. The only reason why I hadn’t been able to succeed
was because I was missing a truly intense will to cause absolute
destruction, a will which linked all other Daos together and then
annihilated them! Now, all of my insights have come together to form
true destruction – Oblivion!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is bullshit! Bullshit!!!” Autarch Ekong was filled with
heart-rending grief and rage as the black warbeast charged towards
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Life
and death are in an endless cycle… but once this civilization comes
to an end, the cycle shall be broken for us. Everything shall truly
be destroyed.” Autarch Bolin was filled with boundless grief as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
they sensed the world around them turn completely still. Even the
terrifyingly powerful aura of the Sithe was quickly suppressed,
followed by an even more horrifying aura of destruction sweeping out.
Both Autarch Ekong and Autarch Bolin turned their heads to look, only
to see a terrifying ripple of darkness emanating from that
white-robed youth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth!”
Despair vanished from the hearts of Autarch Bolin and Autarch Ekong.
Both felt as though color had come back to the world. They both grew
excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
and the three black warbeasts had simultaneously turned to stare at
Ning, their hearts beginning to tremble. “Is that… true
destruction?” Iyerre’s face turned pale. He immediately barked,
“Kill them! Keep killing them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The two black warbeasts that had been charging towards Autarch Bolin
and Autarch Ekong hesitated slightly, then immediately obeyed the
order and continued to press the attack. They knew that there was no
way out. It didn’t matter what breakthrough Emperor Darknorth had
just made. They had to follow this path to the bitter end!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant white-robed Ning opened his eyes. He was able to read the
situation at a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oblivion
Sword Dao!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the countless streams of sword-light which permeated this entire
region all became pitch black. The streaks of pitch-black sword-light
were absolutely terrifying to behold, and their power increased
immeasurably. Although they didn’t possess as much power as the
Sword Titan had when the seven Autarchs had sacrificed parts of their
bodies, the pitch-black sword-light was still far more powerful than
the normal World of Liberation domain. They also moved in much more
marvelous and intricate ways than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three black warbeasts and Iyerre all felt their bodies sink down
under the weight of this domain’s pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
the Sword Titan had been wielding two of the Northbow swords, with a
third Northbow sword beneath the Golden Bridge of Freedom which it
was standing on. Upon its destruction, all three swords had gone
flying. Now, under Ning’s control, the three Northbow swords began
to shoot out towards those three black warbeasts at a speed far
greater than Ning’s own flying speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
this?” The black warbeast who was charging towards Autarch Ekong
and trying to kill him suddenly noticed a black streak of light
shooting towards it at terrifying speed. It was actually three times
as fast as the warbeast itself! It was a Northbow sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Beat
it.” The black warbeast raked out with its claws, seeking to knock
the Northbow sword aside. However, the Northbow sword dodged in an
incredibly agile, almost ghostly manner. The sword easily dodged past
the claws, then hacked straight at the black warbeast’s neck. This
sword was filled with a pure will of destruction, and it caused the
silver-robed woman inside the black warbeast to shiver in fear.
Thankfully, she was inside the black warbeast. If she was outside,
she probably would’ve died from the first blow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black warbeast stumbled backwards slightly from the blow, but it
remained undamaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
The black warbeast pursuing Autarch Bolin was also intercepted by a
Northbow sword. Although a single sword controlled from afar wouldn’t
be enough to defeat one of these black warbeasts, it was enough to
tie it down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit.”
Iyerre’s face grew uglier and uglier. “He’s mastered true
destruction? We have to kill him. Given enough time, he’s probably
going to become an Omega Autarch and bind this entire Chaosverse.
When that happens, we won’t even be able to fight back against
him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mastering
true destruction meant that Ning had taken one step into the realm of
Omega Autarchy! He was able to comprehend ‘Oblivion’, but at the
very end of ‘Oblivion’ was ‘Creation’. This represented the
true apex of all cultivation, Omega Autarchy! Ning was native to this
Chaosverse, born and bred here. If he became an Omega Autarch, he’d
naturally become able to take control over this Chaosverse. There was
no way Iyerre could permit something like this to happen!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how Autarch Bolin had reached an extremely high level
of insight into ‘life and death’ and was extremely powerful, but
hadn’t been able to master the Samsara Daobirth Essence no matter
how hard he tried until he himself was at the brink of death. Ning
had been a bit better off; he had been able to take an incomplete
step into Omega Autarchy by mastering ‘Oblivion’! He had gained a
much higher level of insight, and the amount of power he could summon
from the Dao had dramatically increased as well. All by himself, he
was now slightly more powerful than the Sword Titan which all seven
of them had to work together to create.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth!”
Autarch Bolin and Autarch Ekong were both overjoyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
become an Omega Autarch?” Autarch Ekong asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
yet.” Ning was radiating a will of destruction. “But leave Iyerre
and the others to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Bolin and Ekong both nodded. Ning immediately flew out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three black warbeasts and Iyerre wished to first kill Ekong and
Bolin, but they were all stopped by Ning’s swords. Given that the
Oblivion Sword Dao was suppressing and weakning them, they could do
nothing but simply watch as Ning drew Ekong and Bolin into his
estate-world treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos.
Skyfeeder. Stonerule. Mogg. Don’t worry, my friends. I’m going to
kill them all. NO ONE shall ever be able to annihilate our
civilization!” Ning stared at the distant Iyerre and those three
black warbeasts, then manifested his three-headed, six-armed form.
Three of his six hands reached out, grabbing the three Northbow
swords which flew to him from afar. Moments later he had all six
Northbow swords ready, and he emanated an aura of absolute murder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mastering
‘true destruction’ won’t save you. Surround and kill him!”
Iyerre roared as he, the three black warbeasts, and the seven
violet-gold chains attacked Ning simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes were as cold as ice, and he charged forwards to meet them with
all six Northbow swords at the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Ning was noticeably faster than before, and he
transformed into a streak of black light as he shot outwards. His
swords were now even more shockingly powerful than before, allowing
him to instantly battle against all three black warbeasts and Iyerre
at the same time. Sword-light flashed around him, each flash filled
with an awesome amount of power. As far as close combat went, he was
now much stronger and more effective than previously when he was only
able to use a single sword. He had also reached a much higher level
of insight into the Dao of the Sword, allowing him to drill deep into
the black warbeasts’ bodies with each strike from his sword!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
his blows couldn’t compete with the final desperation attack the
Sword Titan had used, they were more intricate and caused agony to
the Sithe inside the warbeasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t hold on!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t stop him for much longer!” The five Sithe Exalts sent
mentally. Alas, it was too late! Ning struck incredibly fast, and he
was in his three-headed, six-armed form. He landed three consecutive
strikes against one of the black warbeasts, each strike transmitting
the power of destruction inside of the warbeast. The main controller
had a body tough enough to endure these blows, but the five Sithe
Exalts all perished after taking three such collisions. Even worse,
the awesome power of Oblivion which washed over them resulted in even
their truesouls being devoured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how the sphere of annihilation was able to devour
anything, even truesoul fragments. Ning’s own power was coursing
with the will of Oblivion, allowing him to do the same thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Their
truesoul fragments have been completely devoured!” Iyerre’s three
allies began to panic. The only surviving Sithe were the three of
them and Iyerre himself.</P>

Chapter 13: Wiped Out</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
naturally knew just how deadly Darknorth was now that the man had
mastered Oblivion. He immediately sent consolingly, “Don’t worry.
Although I can’t revive you if your truesouls are destroyed, I’ll
ask my master to do so! Neither of us have any way out of this. We
have to beat Darknorth in battle. As long as we can win, any of you
who do end up dying will be revived as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Normally,
in order to bring someone back to life, the process which both
Autarchs and Omega Autarchs used involved reverse spacetime to call
back the truesoul fragments! However, once you became a Lord of
Chaos, things were completely different. To a Chaoslord, whether or
not the truesoul fragments were destroyed didn’t really matter
much.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The silver-robed woman and the other two had no choice but to trust
Iyerre. They were going to follow this path to the bitter end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
deaths of those five Exalts actually…” As Ji Ning slew those five
Sithe Exalts, he could clearly sense that the entire Chaosverse was
slightly strengthened after draining away their truesouls. “It
actually allowed the Chaosverse to heal. Mm. In the past, when we
slew Sithe Exalts their truesouls would return to the Sithe
Chaosverse. Those five, however, could not. I completely destroyed
their truesouls, transforming their energies into pure life energy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Does
that mean… that my power over destruction is also able to nourish
the Quintessence of the Chaosverse?” Ning was beginning to get an
inkling of what this portended. However, now was not the time for
training. It was the time for fighting!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Slow
him down! The three of you, slow him down while I look for an
opening,” Iyerre barked mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The three black warbeasts began to circle around Ning, doing their
best to impede his movements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
six Northbow swords were all filled with the aura of Oblivion, and
they completely suppressed the three black warbeasts. Each blasting
strike unleash Oblivion into the bodies of the black warbeasts,
causing the three to feel rather miserable. However, their bodies
were far stronger than those of most Exalts and so they were fully
capable of enduring this. This made it so that for now, Ning was
unable to do anything to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
black warbeasts are completely indestructible.” Ning knew how tough
these things were. They weren’t a match for him, but they were able
to slow him down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Iyerre unleashed a dazzling burst of light that spread everywhere,
while he himself hid within the light to launch repeated sneak
attacks against Ning. Ning felt a sense of pressure, as Iyerre was an
Omega Autarch who had an even higher level of insight than Ning
himself. Although he was now much more powerful than before, those
three black warbeasts made it so that he was unable to fully focus on
battling Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
This is my homeland. My power is endless here, but the Sithe? They’re
using up energy at a frantic rate. They won’t be able to last.”
After realizing that there was no way for him to immediately win,
Ning switched to a defensive-oriented strategy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
Iyerre, still seeking an opening, felt his heart sank. Ning was far
more powerful than the Sword Titan had been. Ning had three heads and
six arms, whereas the Sword Titan only had two arms. Ning was also at
a higher level of enlightenment than the Sword Titan. If Ning had
furiously pressed the assault, Iyerre might’ve been able to find an
opening and exploit it to achieve victory… but now that Ning
focused on defense, it was going to be very, very hard to win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
battle was raging throughout the Grassland World as Ning clashed
repeatedly against the Sithe. He dropped from the third layer of
clouds to the second layer, then fought all the way back to the fifth
layer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning would’ve been able to leave whenever he wished, but he
knew that if he did so then Iyerre probably wouldn’t take on the
risk of pursuing him. Thus, he continued to battle them within the
Grassland World!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn,
damn, damn!” Iyerre had repeatedly tried to exploit openings, but
Ning was so cautious that Iyerre was unable to succeed at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
this warbeast isn’t going to last any longer!” the black-robed
man sent frantically. “It is almost out of power!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Iyerre was shocked. The three black warbasts would only be able to
battle for one hour under normal circumstances. Linked up with Iyerre
via formation, they consumed energy even faster! The situation was
worsened after the Sword Titan had unleashed that ‘desperation
blow’, causing heavy damage to all of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that when faced with an enormous attack, even an
‘invulnerable form’ would have to consume a tremendous amount of
power to survive it. The same was true for these three black
warbeasts! The one which the black-robed man commanded had been the
one which absorbed the life-core of the white-furred, red-eyed
humanoid. It was comparatively weaker and so its power was the first
to run dry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
out of power! Save me!” the black-robed man sent frantically, his
warbeast beginning to flee. Boom! The formerly-stable formation and
the black-white light within it began to destabilize. Given his
insight, Ning immediately realized what this portended.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
Ning willed two Northbow swords to fly out, moving far faster than
Ning himself could. They instantly crashed onto that black warbeast…
and their blows were like the straws that broke the camel’s back.
The black warbeast trembled and then began to rapidly dwindle in
size, no longer able to stay in war-mode. As it shrank the
black-robed man appeared outside of it, his face a mask of terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to escape!” The black-robed man wanted to flee through
spacetime, but as soon as the spacetime rift appeared next to him
those two Northbow swords sliced through both the dimensional tear
and his own body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Both were wiped out. The black-robed man opened his mouth, his eyes
filled with shock and resentment, but he was completely annihilated
by the power of this terrifying Oblivion Sword Dao. His truesoul
fragments were completely devoured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Coldnoon!”
the other two called out frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning could clearly sense that the prime essences of the Chaosverse
had grown quite a bit more powerful after devouring the black-robed
man’s energies. The effect was actually superior to when it had
drained those five Sithe Exalts! “All by himself, he vastly
surpassed five of those Exalts? Where in the world did he come from?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
thoughts flitted through Ning’s mind, but he cast them away and
seized this chance to press the attack. He was going to make use of
this opportunity to wipe all the Sithe out, sparing no one!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”
“Let’s flee!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
silver-robed woman and the red-robed man no longer had any
inclination towards continuing the fight. Now that one of them had
died, their formation had been destroyed and they were dramatically
weakened. To continue fighting would be suicide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! The Northbow swords in Ning’s hands shot out once more. This
time, all six of them flew out. Four of them flew towards the two
remaining black warbeasts, while two chased after the already-fleeing
Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
over! It’s all over!” Iyerre’s heart was cold and gripped by
despair. Although Ning had only taken a single step into the realm of
Omega Autarchy, this was his homeland! He was able to unleash an
unlimited amount of power here. Now that Iyerre no longer was being
supported by that formation, his attacks were too weak even though
his techniques were profound. There was simply no way for him to
continue battling against Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to go!” Iyerre glanced at the two black warbeasts and the
shrunken ‘doll’ which had fallen down to the clouds. Although he
ached at the loss, he no longer had the time to prevent it. Swoosh!
Iyerre instantly tore through space, warping away and disappearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
The two Northbow swords sliced through the dimensional rift and
crushed it, but they were just a moment too late. Ning frowned. “He’s
a fast runner!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that for him to kill Iyerre would be extremely difficult, as
Iyerre’s level of insight was simply too high. He vastly surpassed
Ning in many areas, such as spacetime; it would be very difficult to
stop him once he decided to flee. The only way to kill him would be
to keep his swords circling around Iyerre, destroying every single
spacetime rift the man created. However, Iyerre had been too fast and
had perfect control over this battlefield. As soon as things had
begun to go south, he had immediately fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t matter if he escaped. I’ll get rid of these two first.”
Ning charged towards the two remaining black warbeasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth! Spare us, spare us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
were forced to do this! This is all because of Iyerre!” The two
terrified and fleeing black warbeasts both began to beg for mercy.
They knew that thanks to the repeated attacks by the Northbow swords,
their own warbeasts were about to run dry as well. They had sought to
tear a spatial rift out of the Grassland World and escape, but each
time the two Northbow swords would prevent them from doing so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, even if they did manage to escape, they would remain within
the Grassland World! Iyerre, however, had been able to truly escape
with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spare
you? Who ‘spared’ all the cultivators who died?” Ning’s eyes
were filled with murder. There was no way he was going to show mercy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“N-no…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
that Iyerre!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two black warbeasts once more began to shrink and transform into
dolls, having used up the last scraps of their energies. The
silver-robed woman and the red-robed man were both annihilated by
Ning’s sword-light, and their energies were devoured by the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
had frantically warped through spacetime numerous types, fearing that
Ning might chase after him. Finally, he reached an empty region in
space which was at one of the ‘border areas’ of the entire
Chaosverse. This was a place where many different spacetime
continuums were gathered together. There were countless such
‘gathering spots’, each of which represented the borders between
the Chaosverse and the Infinite Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Iyerre waved his hand, causing the void before him to split into two
halves and revealing the dazzling sight outside. This was the
beautiful, stunning Infinite Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
stepped out, departing from this Chaosverse and entering the Infinite
Void. Only then did he finally manage to let out a sigh of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
turned to look backwards at the awesome, endless celestial object
below him. This was the homeland which Ning and his fellow natives
belonged to, an enormous Chaosverse. Iyerre had been smitten by it
and had gone crazy in an effort to conquer it. This was the
Chaosverse which Iyerre had dreamed of controlling for so long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.
Damn it all.” Iyerre was no longer able to calm down, and his eyes
were filled with resentment. He had prepared for so long, but he
still ended up failing. It had been a complete defeat, and he was the
only one to escape and survive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go find Master.” Iyerre could think of no other solutions. He had
to go beg his master for help. He truly didn’t wish to accept this
defeat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
He began to advance through the vast Infinite Void, headed towards
his master’s residence.</P>

Chapter 14: The Other Face of Oblivion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning picked up the three black dolls, sending his godsense into them
to inspect them. He couldn’t help but feel rather shocked at the
marvelous artifice used to make them. It must be remembered that not
even Iyerre himself was able to create these things; they were even
more arcane than the Grassland World or the Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
actually unable to bind them.” Ning tested out binding them, but
much like how the Autarch message-talismans could only be used by
specific Autarchs, these black dolls could only be used by a
preapproved ‘list’ of people. Iyerre was able to temporarily
grant ‘usage rights’ to the Grassland World to his three allies,
but as soon he arrived he was able to take back that right. The same
was true for these black dolls!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
I can’t bind them, I’ll still benefit from studying them.” Ning
waved his hand, putting them away. He stared at the vast Grassland
World and at the Golden Bridges which lay fallen within the clouds,
his heart rather heavy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had won, but the cost had been far, far too great. Iyerre had managed
to escape as well. Ning didn’t chase after him, because he knew
that engaging in a long-distance pursuit was pointless. Iyerre was no
fool; the man had undoubtedly fled out of this entire Chaosverse.
Besides, as soon as Ning closed in on Iyerre, the latter would
undoubtedly notice and would immediately warp through spacetime
again, giving Ning no chance to attack at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning waved a hand, causing two figures to appear next to him. It was
Autarch Ekong and Autarch Bolin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
did it go, Darknorth?” Ekong and Bolin scanned the area around
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said rather unhappily, “The other Sithe are all dead, but Iyerre
ended up escaping. I was so close! Ugh.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he escaped, he escaped.” Bolin and Ekong didn’t care that much.
Bolin said, “His level of insight is simply too high. Killing him
will be far, far too difficult. Although we paid a heavy price to
just barely win this battle… we were still the victors! Iyerre has
already used up everything he has prepared over all these years.
He’ll never have the chance to overcome us again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong said worriedly, “What if he comes back and tries again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have the advantage of time. As more time passes, our accumulated
power shall increase more and more. We’ll even give birth to new
Autarchs,” Bolin said. “So… if he wishes to come back, he’ll
need to do so as soon as possible. But the very fact that he chose to
flee this critical battle is proof that he’s already used up
everything he has! Come back? With what!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed with this assessment. If Iyerre was to return, he had to do so
with a new source of power! Iyerre had been supported by both the
Grassland World and those three black warbeasts which had joined into
a formation to support him, but in the end he had still lost both the
battle and his allies. What would he use to launch another attack?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
grieve for Titanos and the others,” Ning sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of us were afraid of death. So long as we won, death holds no fear
for us.” Bolin sighed as well. “Our only fear was of losing. Now
that we have won, it is enough.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and try to bind the Grassland World,” Ning said. “I’m
worried that if Iyerre comes back, he’ll come straight for the
Grassland World first. It probably won’t be easy for anyone else to
bind.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Bolin and Ekong both agreed. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The three
immediately flew downwards and began to surveil the entire Grassland
World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as Ning had predicted, it was impossible for them to bind the
Grassland World. “If we cannot bind it, then let us destroy its
quintessence core.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Bolin, and Ekong stood next to each other within that castle located
deep within the depths of the Grassland World, staring at an indigo
globe before them. This indigo globe had returned to its normal
state, now that nothing was trying to ‘squeeze’ more power out of
it. Although it was very small, all three could sense the enormous
amount of power contained within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
quintessence core was extremely important to the Sithe, but it wasn’t
of much use to the three of them. In their own homeland, they had
access to the unlimited power of the Chaosverse itself. There was no
need for a puny quintessence core like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
it.” Ning struck out with a Northbow sword, sending black
sword-light slicing through the air and chopping apart everything in
its path. This severing sword-light sliced straight at the distant
indigo globe. Although there was some resistance, the sword managed
to hack through it. Once the sword reached the very core of that
indigo globe, the Oblivion-infused sword-light dramatically flared.
The indigo globe first split in half, then suddenly exploded
completely due to the power of the sword-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Power swept out in every direction, but thanks to the suppressive
effect of the Oblivion Sword Dao, by the time the shockwave reached
Ning and the other two it had already weakened down to 1%. The
enormous barrier of sword-light circling around them was able to
defend against the shockwave with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can sense that the prime essences have become considerably stronger
after absorbing this power,” Ekong said suddenly. “In fact, the
prime essences are stronger than ever before.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “I previously slew five Sithe Exalts and three incredibly
strong Sithe. The Chaosverse and the prime essences absorbed all of
their energies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the deaths of Titanos and the others had weakened the Chaosverse, the
three incredibly strong Sithe killed by Ning had truesouls which were
equivalent in ‘value’ to those of ten Autarchs! Their gains had
completely surpasses their losses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
they destroyed the quintessence core of the Grassland World, they
then headed off to do the same to the sphere of annihilation within
the Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bolin
and Ekong were both worried that Ning might not be able to accomplish
it, but Ning proved them wrong. A single sword infused with the
Oblivion Sword Dao was all it took to tear the sphere of annihilation
open, destroying all of the mysteries of Oblivion contained within
it. In the end, the entire sphere of annihilation collapsed. When it
broke apart, it no longer looked like a shadowy orb. It revealed its
true appearance, transforming into a tiny, solid-looking ball of
light. The ball of light completely exploded, sending a limitless
amount of energy blasting in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the shockwave spread out, it seemed to cause the Five Elements,
spacetime, and more to transform… but in the end, it disappeared
without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning murmured softly, “Everything in the sphere of annihilation
actually collapsed into a singularity, then exploded… and then it
gave birth to one, which gave birth to two, which gave birth to
three, which gave birth to all things?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
next step to my Sword Dao should be ‘Creation’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Omega Sword Dao. At first, Ning had fused multiple other Daos into
his Sword Dao, creating the many other so-called Sword Daos such as
the Spacetime Sword Dao, the Cycle Sword Dao, the Karma Sword Dao,
etc. Later on, after he meditated on ‘Oblivion’, Ning finally
managed to bring the Five Elements, Yin and Yang, the Cycle of Light
and Dark, Karma, and Spacetime together, using his will of
obliteration to fuse them into a single Dao known as the Oblivion
Sword Dao! This was why the Oblivion Sword Dao was so incredibly
powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had used the Oblivion Sword Dao to slay those Sithe, he
discovered that after killing them they would transform into pure
energy which nourished the Chaosverse. This had instantly intrigued
Ning – could it be that the purpose of destruction was actually to
provide nourishment and create new life? However, during the battle
Ning didn’t have time to really ruminate over this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Upon
seeing the sphere of annihilation collapse, Ning began to gain an
even deeper understanding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao is split into Yin and Yang. There are two sides to all things. In
order for the Omega Sword Dao to reach Autarchy, simply fusing all
the other Sword Daos together to create ‘Oblivion’ isn’t
enough; that will only display a single facet of the true Autarch
Omega Sword Dao. The other face of destruction is the creation of new
life. One begats two, two begats three, and three begats all things.”
[1. The one/two/three thing is deeply embedded in actual Daoism and
is far too complicated to explain here.]</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
exited the Annihilation Hive, then came to the Grassland World once
more. The Grassland World had returned to its normal appearance and
no longer had a threatening aura.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine layers of clouds atop the Grassland World had vanished. Even the
grass had vanished, leaving behind a slick, black metal construct.
Ning first fashioned a new avatar, then sat down in the lotus
position atop the Grassland World and began to meditate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was going to wait here. If Iyerre came once more, he would probably
head to the Grassland World first. “Bolin. Ekong. I need to
meditate silently,” Ning said. “As for Iyerre… if he comes,
leave him to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Bolin andn Ekong didn’t disturb him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
closed his eyes, beginning to ruminate upon the profound mysteries of
the Dao of the Sword. All his other Sword Daos had come together to
form a single whole, the Oblivion Sword Dao… but now, the Oblivion
Sword Dao was changing and transforming to reveal its other ‘face’.
The diametric opposite of the Oblivion Sword Dao appeared as the
power of destruction slowly began to nurture life. It was as though a
‘shell’ of utter destruction pervaded this entire Dao, but at its
very heart life was slowly being nurtured…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Infinite Void. Here, spacetime was far more twisted and distorted
than any Chaosverse could ever be. It was filled with enormous
celestial objects and countless marvelous species.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was hastening through this great void. The first time he had
travelled to Ning’s Chaosverse he had moved slowly and with great
care, but now that he had made multiple round trips he had become
quite familiar with the (still-dangerous) path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
so often, Iyerre would turn to stare backwards. Although he had
travelled a very great distance, the vast Chaosverse behind him still
looked endless beyond measure. Only by taking control over it could
one truly stand at the very pinnacle of existence within the Infinite
Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had spent nine days after exiting the Grassland World before managing
to escape that Chaosverse, then two full months before he finally
reached the estate where his master’s avatar resided.</P>

Chapter 15: Lord of Chaos</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Iyerre warped through spacetime, arriving at a giant floating boulder
which was many kilometers long. His facial expressions grew markedly
more respectful. A small wooden courtyard had been built atop the
stone boulder, and in the center was a log cabin. Through the seams
in the log cabin, he was able to vaguely make out a skinny,
azure-robed form seated in the lotus position within.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
wood cabin and courtyard looked fragile, as though it could be
destroyed with the flick of a finger. Iyerre, however, would never
dare to offend. Instead he stood outside the courtyard and said
respectfully, “Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Inside
was his master, a truly legendary figure. He was amongst the first
Sithe who rose to power, and he quickly outstripped all others by a
wide margin. Countless Sithe venerated his very existence, and he
eventually came to control his entire Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
had been the very second Omega Autarch in his homeland, but he still
felt that his master far surpassed him in many regards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
failed?” The voice was gentle and warm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
failed. Completely failed.” Iyerre’s mood was rather downcast.
“The subordinates I brought with me were either killed or captured.
It was a complete and total defeat. I’m the only one who managed to
escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity about those three Sourcewalkers. It wasn’t easy for them to
reach their level,” the person instead sighed. “Each of them was
formed from the concentrated essence of my Chaosverse. Reviving them
won’t be easy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
didn’t dare to say a word. Long ago, he and his master had come to
an agreement. His master had carved out a large chunk of their entire
Chaosverse and gave it to Iyerre to rule as he saw fit! All of the
Sithe who rose to power within that part of the Chaosverse would be
under his control, and he would be permitted to use them to invade
other Chaosverses! However, there were two exceptions to this –
Sourcewalker Autarchs and Omega Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
Omega Emperor had the potential to become an Omega Autarch. His
master would take all such figures away! Thus, not a single Omega
Emperor had joined the war against Ji Ning’s Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sourcewalkers
were the treasured darlings of the Chaosverses. The amount of energy
they contained in their bodies vastly surpassed all their peers, and
after reaching Autarchy they grew to be far more powerful! They
completely surpassed all the other Exalts. The silver-robed woman and
the other two had been Sourcewalker Autarchs. Iyerre felt that he
needed to strengthen his forces, and so he had summoned his courage
and asked for his master to transfer them to his command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
though Sourcewalker Autarchs were unable to summon the power of the
Dao in Ning’s Chaosverse, they were still on par with Titanos and
Mogg in power! This was why they were able to truly make use of the
power of the black warbeasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
all of them were dead. Even their truesouls had been devoured. His
master, as the Lord of Chaos, had access to unbelievable abilities
and would still be able to revive them, but this process would
consume the energies of the prime essences! Their deaths had already
caused the prime essences of the Sithe Chaosverse to weaken; to bring
them back would weaken the prime essences a second time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was all due to my uselessness.” Iyerre lowered his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
did you lose?” the gentle, warm voice asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was because of an Omega Emperor named Emperor Darknorth,” Iyerre
explained immediately. “I was at the verge of victory. I could see
it right in front of me! But at that critical moment between life and
death… perhaps because all of his civilization rested on his
shoulders… Emperor Darknorth went completely berserk and actually
managed to upgrade his Omega Sword Dao to become the Oblivion Sword
Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
probably reached the threshold long ago, but needed a little extra
push. The pressure of his entire civilization about to collapse drove
him across that final barrier, allowing him to take one step into
Omega Autarchy.” The warm voice was rather surprised. “You can’t
be blamed for your defeat. Now that he has taken this step, becoming
an Omega Autarch is nothing more than a matter of time. He’ll
eventually realize that ‘Oblivion’ is just one face of his
Autarch Omega Sword Dao. He’ll come to understand what the other
face is and then act accordingly. Haha… finally, a second Chaoslord
has arisen within the nine Chaosverses.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
am I really supposed to just give up?” Iyerre said desperately,
“There are only eight Chaosverses aside from our own. Emperor
Darknorth’s was the weakest of the eight, and I know more about it
than any of the others. If I have to give up on it, I’ll have no
chance at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were nine Chaosverses in total. The Sithe had given birth to one Lord
of Chaos, but the other eight Chaosverses had not. Iyerre had chosen
Ning’s Chaosverse as his target because it was weak. The other
seven were all stronger, and over the course of years they had only
grown even more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
all of them are very powerful,” that gentle voice said. “The
seven remaining Chaosverses… even the weakest has at least twelve
Autarchs, while the strongest has thirty-nine Autarchs and five Omega
Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
Emperor Darknorth has taken one step into Omega Autarchy, it’ll
take some time for him to take the final step,” Iyerre said
hurriedly. “If he doesn’t realize that there’s another side to
Oblivion, he’ll be stuck there for even longer! I need to seize
every moment and press the counter-attack. His homeland only has two
Autarchs left, aside from Emperor Darknorth. Emperor Darknorth is the
only impediment. Once we destroy him, we’ll have won.” Iyerre’s
gaze was filled with desperation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Win?”
The voice turned cold. “And how do you think you will win?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why I’ve come to ask you for help, Master.” Iyerre said
hurriedly, “If you concur, we’ll still be able to win thanks to
your many Exalts, your Omega Emperors, and your treasures.” He
didn’t dare to even ask for his master to risk invading Ning’s
Chaosverse in person. No Lord of Chaos could possibly be foolish
enough to risk his own life in another Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph!”
The voice inside turned rather angry. “Iyerre, I gave you nearly
30% of my entire Chaosverse to administer, but you still failed. Now,
you even wish for the children under my rule to risk their lives for
you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
bring them back to life after they die,” Iyerre said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Back
to life? How will you make up for that enormous loss of energy?
There’s no way I will permit my Chaosverse to be weakened that
much. Iyerre, you need to know when to stop!” His master truly was
becoming angry. Now that Ning had mastered the Oblivion Sword Dao,
the truesouls of the Sithe he killed would be unable to return to the
Sithe Chaosverse. As a result, the Sithe Chaosverse was being
steadily weakened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Send
more Exalts over to Ning’s Chaosverse? It was entirely possible
that if their Chaosverse was weakened to a certain extent, Emperor
Darknorth would lead an invasion after he became a Lord of Chaos!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
two Chaosverses were fairly close to each other in power, neither
would be able to do anything to the other. But if one side was much
weaker than the other? It was possible for a Chaosverse to be
defeated!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
that place remains Emperor Darknorth’s home. You have probably
already lost the Grassland World and the Annihilation Hive. Without
them, sending in more Exalts would be pointless. They would simply
die,” Iyerre’s master said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
fell silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you are truly determined to the point of risking death… there may
be hope,” his master said suddenly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Risking
death?” Iyerre’s eyes lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have one treasure, a protective treasure which I created after
countless aeons of hard work. It will allow you to ignite the
majority of your truesoul and pour it inside to unleash a supremely
powerful skill. With this treasure, you stand a chance at gaining
victory,” his master said. “But this treasure does have a flaw.
When you use it, you’ll suffer from an enormous backlash. If you
win the battle, you’ll be able to slowly recover… but if you
lose, you’ll probably be killed by Emperor Darknorth on the spot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you willing?” his master asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am willing! I’m willing to die in my attempts to take that final
step and reach the true apex of cultivation. What’s the point of
living without hope?” Iyerre gritted his teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
more thing. If you fail, remember to destroy this treasure instead of
letting it fall into Darknorth’s hand,” his master said. “I
imagine you lost the warbeasts I gave you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
lost them. Don’t worry, Master. If I fail, I won’t let Emperor
Darknorth acquire this protective treasure,” Iyerre said calmly. If
it fell into Ning’s hands, Ning would be able to learn from it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a strange medallion flew over to Iyerre, who caught it. This
medallion was palm-sized and very heavy. Even Iyerre felt some
pressure from its weight, as though it was actually an entire world
he was holding. The medallion’s surface was covered with black and
white diagrams, with the two sides being black and the center being
white. It was like there were two tall black mountains parted by a
white gorge or a white river. It seemed almost sentient, and Iyerre
immediately bound it to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incredible.”
As soon as he bound it, he understood just how formidable and
valuable this treasure was. In terms of preciousness, it was actually
superior to both the Annihilation Hive and the Grassland World. It
lived up to its reputation as a treasure which his master had
personally kept for protection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
master was now truly invincible, while he himself had been driven to
utter despair. This was the only reason why his master had been
willing to gift him even a protective treasure of such value. It
represented the crystallized essence of his master’s boundless
wisdom, which was why his master had instructed him to destroy it if
he failed the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Master,” Iyerre said excitedly. He couldn’t help but ask,
“What is it called?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
voice inside fell silent for a moment, then said slowly, “It is
called the Stele of Mountains and Rivers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Stele of Mountains and Rivers?” Iyerre stared at the tablet in his
palm, then nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
off, then. Shoo.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
immediately bowed respectfully and gratefully once more, then turned
to leave. He needed to seize every moment. Although he felt that it
was likely that Ning wouldn’t be able to quickly understand the
opposite side of Oblivion and thus would be stuck there for a long
period of time, he wanted to give himself the best chance possible
and launch his counter-attack quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending two more months in travel, he reached Ning’s Chaosverse
once more. After entering it, he began to warp through spacetime to
the location of the Grassland World, which is where they had fought
earlier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
going to die, and I’m going to win.” Iyerre hurried forth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only thing left in the Grassland World was that black metallic tower.
The white-robed Ning sat by himself next to that black tower, the
flow of time around him markedly different from that of the outside
world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
mind was filled with the secrets of the Dao of the Sword, which
continued to transform and multiply. It was the opposite of what
Iyerre had expected. As soon as Ning had mastered the Oblivion Sword
Dao, he had immediately realized that there was another face to
destruction and knew what path he had to take.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
mind was filled with the boundless power of the Oblivion Sword Dao,
and the new life which it nurtured. As time flowed on, the vital
energy birthed by his Oblivion Sword Dao grew more and more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
One day, the boundless vitality at the core of his Oblivion Sword Dao
reached such a level where it finally exploded! The darkness of
oblivion instantly vanished, leaving behind nothing save for a
dazzling, pure pulse of vital energy. Boundless amounts of vital
energy swept out in every direction, resulting in space and time
being born, things dividing into Yin and Yang, the Five Elements
arising, and finally karma emerging to link them all together. Even
the boundless vital energy was affected by karma, and so karma tied
it together. The Five Elements came together while Yin and Yang
tangled around each other, and all of them combined with that vital
energy to give birth to one new creature after another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
stars were born. The emptiness of space was born. Planets were born
with verdant life, flowers, and bugs. With but a thought, entire
worlds were created.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, all Daos come together to form the singularity known as
Omega, which I express through my Omega Sword Dao.” Now that he
fully understood the other face of Oblivion, Ning’s second foot
stepped past the threshold of Omega Autarchy as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The dazzling Flower of Eternity at the very peak of the towering
Dao-tree within Ning’s Jindan chaos region gradually began to
wither… but as it did so, a fruit was growing from within it. As
the fruit grew, it began to assume a humanoid shape. It was filled
with boundless sword-intent that only grew denser and denser… until
finally, the fruit took full form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
fruit was humanoid in shape and looked exactly like Ning himself. It
was seated in the lotus position, a smile on its face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire Grassland World began to stir and shudder as a boundless
amount of energy began to converge upon it. Ning’s body was
beginning to transform, while his consciousness expanded
dramatically. It now filled every single inch of the entire
Chaosverse, resonating with the prime essences of the Chaosverse. He
could sense that the prime essences were crying out in joy and
celebration. His will naturally became one with every part of the
Quintessence, not facing any resistance at all. He was now able to
bind it whenever he chose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the true nature and appearance of the prime essences?” Ning
was intoxicated by it all.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_016__The"></A>
Chapter 16: The End (Part 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was now able to clearly see the true appearance of the entire
Quintessence for the first time. The Quintessence was formed of
countless Eternal Omega Daos, with the Eternal Omega Sword Dao merely
being one of them. The other Eternal Omega Daos included the Eternal
Omega Karma Dao, the Eternal Omega Time Dao, the Eternal Omega Space
Dao, the Eternal Omega Spacetime Dao, the Eternal Omega Metal Dao,
the Eternal Omega Water Dao, the Eternal Omega Samsara Dao, the
Eternal Omega Five Elements Dao…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them were Eternal Omega Daos. They were all the same level, but
some were stronger than the others. All of them were linked together
and influenced each other, coming together to form an instinctive
reaction which would cause the Chaosverse to function in accordance
with certain rules!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
things are linked, as are all Daos.” After understanding the
Autarch Omega Sword Dao, Ning had reached the stage of the so-called
‘Daobirth’! Ning was now in control of the Eternal Omega Daos for
all other Daos, including spacetime, life and death, and more. This
was what had made Iyerre so very powerful. His expertise lay in the
Dao of Light, but he had reached the Eternal Omega Dao level in all
other Daos as well. This was why he had surpassed all of them in
employing spacetime!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
there was fairness in all things. If you wished to become a Lord of
Chaos, you generally had to be the very first Omega Autarch within a
Chaosverse. The first one would have no guidance from anyone else and
have to fight through a thorn-laden path in order to succeed. His
path would be harder than anyone else’s, and he was worthier than
any others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the second Omega Autarch? Now that a precursor had shown the way,
the difficulty of becoming an Omega Autarch would drop tenfold or
even more. If the second Omega Autarch wished to become a Chaoslord,
he would have to invade another Chaosverse… but in doing so, he
would be suppressed and rejected, unable to use even a sliver of the
Dao’s power. This was an incredibly difficult task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
prime essences aren’t truly sentient, nor are the various Daos
truly merged together.” Ning let out a sigh. The Quintessence was
formed from multiple independent Eternal Omega Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning? Not only did he control multiple Eternal Omega Daos, he was
also in control of a truly complete and perfect Autarch Omega Sword
Dao. In terms of insight, he surpassed the entire Quintessence. This
was why he was qualified to bind it! The prime essences themselves
were celebrating his rise. They didn’t reject him at all. In fact,
they were looking forward to Ning binding them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a huge disturbance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin and Autarch Ekong were off in the distance, training silently.
Both turned to stare at the Grassland World, then traded glances.
They quickly warped through spacetime towards the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a boundless amount of energy was gathering around the Grassland
World. The energy was transforming Ning’s body, causing his
heartworld to expand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bolin
and Ekong were unable to even see Ning, who was at the center of that
absolute maelstrom of energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
never seen such an enormous flood of energy before. I feel as though
the prime essences are pouring all of their power into this place.”
Bolin let out a sigh of joy. “Darknorth seems to have broken
through into Autarchy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
he must have become an Omega Autarch! Otherwise, why would there be
such a huge disturbance?” Ekong was excited as well. “This is
wonderful. Our civilization has finally given birth to our own Lord
of Chaos! It seems as though we’ll never have to worry about being
invaded again.” They had been under the constant threat of invasion
for countless aeons. It had weighed upon them very, very heavily.
Even though they had beaten back the Sithe twice, if they didn’t
gain their own Lord of Chaos they would probably suffer more
invasions in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
a Lord of Chaos would grant them true freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Finally,
someone has succeeded. Brother Titanos, brother Mogg… Stonerule and
Skyfeeder… can you see this?” Bolin murmured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
mind gazed upon the entire Quintessence. He had become one with it,
and he could sense every single thing within the entire vast
Chaosverse. Thus, Ning was able to sense Iyerre as soon as he entered
the Chaosverse and began to warp towards the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
actually came back already? Judging from that look in his eyes and
his posture, he looks like he’s ready to battle to the death. He
must have something which he thinks gives him a shot at it.” Ning
continued to watch carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
his current power as an Omega Autarch, even if he didn’t bind the
Chaosverse he was still able to summon enough power from the Dao to
kill Iyerre with ease!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
bind it first.” Since Iyerre had entered the Chaosverse, he
wouldn’t be able to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning’s mind entered the Quintessence and began to bind it to
himself. He didn’t suffer any pushback at all. Everything happened
smoothly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the various Daos that had been functioning automatically within the
Quintessence suddenly began to transform. Previously, they had
functioned in accordance with how the other Daos influenced them. Now
that Ning had bound them, they changed in accordance with Ning’s
will. All of the other Eternal Omega Daos began to swirl around the
newly-emerged and towering ‘Autarch Omega Sword Dao’ that had
appeared within their midst.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the Autarch Omega Sword Dao became the new foundation of this entire
Chaosverse, with all other Daos serving to support and reinforce it.
In this instance, the Chaosverse gained a new ‘soul’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning arose from his position within the Grassland World.
He took a single step forwards, appearing within the center of the
Quintessence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Far
away, atop an enormous boulder that hovered within the Infinite Void.
A skinny figure suddenly pushed open the door to the wooden room atop
the boulder, emerging from it. His skin was dark, he had a pair of
horns on his head, and he was dressed in azure robes. His
unfathomably deep eyes gazed towards the direction of Ning’s
Chaosverse, a stunned look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This…”
He could clearly sense what had just happened. The vast aura of that
incomparably massive Chaosverse had suddenly changed. Its previously
expansive aura had suddenly condensed and stabilized, in the end
transforming into a terrifying sword-intent. This was the aura of an
Autarch Omega Sword Dao! It was supremely venerable and peerlessly
offensive. That Chaosverse was like an honest, amiable person who had
turned into a terrifying killer swordsman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Omega Sword Dao. The Dao of the Sword is a Dao meant for attacking.”
The azure-robed horned man frowned. “I never would’ve thought
that the second Lord of Chaos would be such a troublesome figure.
Iyerre truly is a fool.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were differences amongst Eternal Omega Daos. The same was true for
Autarch Omega Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Dao of the Sword was meant for combat. It was not a Dao to be taken
lightly! This was why the azure-robed man had immediately bestowed
his own protective treasure, the ‘Stele of Mountains and Rivers’,
to Iyerre upon learning that Ning had already mastered the power of
Oblivion. He himself knew that he had been the one who had aided
Iyerre in forging the Annihilation Hive and the Grassland World.
Given that so many Exalts had perished, with even the Sourcewalker
Autarchs dying, he knew that sending in more forces would be useless!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, we weren’t able to forestall his rise.” The horned,
azure-robed figure shook his head. “And Darknorth truly is crafty.
He only began the binding process after Iyerre entered his
Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned figure stared at the towering Chaosverse, now emanating an
awesome aura of the Dao of the Sword. He felt a headache coming.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had been able to easily bind the Quintessence of the Chaosverse
without encountering any resistance at all. After becoming an Omega
Autarch, Ning had restructured his mana in accordance with his
Autarch Omega Sword Dao, while his soul had undergone a qualitative
transformation. There had been a bit of pressure when he began to
bind the Chaosverse, but Ning was able to endure that pressure with
ease. After he completed the binding, the pressure disappeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast Chaosverse was now like his own body, with all of its Daos
available for him to command. Everything within the Chaosverse was
under his control, including all of space and time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to gaze off into the distance. His gaze pierced through space
and time, allowing him to see every single creature who had ever
lived within this Chaosverse, including recently-deceased figures
like Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg and even long-dead figures like
Autarch Awakener and Autarch Entropos. He also saw figures from the
Three Realms like Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Daoist Three Purities,
Shennong, Suiren, Fuxi, and also his beloved Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of their truesouls had been shattered, while others had even their
truesoul fragments destroyed. Ning, however, was capable of reviving
them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
he gazed into the past he was able to see their truesouls with
clarity, even if their truesouls were shattered. He would be able to
reform them from the void itself, recreating them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
even able to revive those whose truesoul fragments were destroyed?”
Ning was absolutely delighted. “I’m virtually omnipotent in my
own Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously
Ning and the others had all believed that those who had lost their
truesoul could not be revived, but that was because none of them had
any experience actually being a Lord of Chaos. They had no idea as to
just how truly incredible a Chaoslord was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
their own Chaosverses, Lords of Chaos were able to connect past,
present, and future together. There was almost nothing they could not
do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.
I’m not truly omnipotent.” Ning suddenly came to this
realization. “I still can’t see through Iyerre’s soul and
truesoul.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was able to see through the souls and truesouls of all other living
beings, which meant he was able to understand and replicate them…
but Iyerre’s truesoul was constructed based on the Autarch Omega
Light Dao. Ning didn’t understand the Autarch Omega Light Dao, and
so he wouldn’t be able to create a soul based off of it. By the
same principle, the Sithe Lord of Chaos was also incapable of
recreating Iyerre’s truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I killed Iyerre… the Sithe Chaoslord wouldn’t be able to bring
him back?” A cold, murderous look flashed through Ning’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning took a step forwards, immediately appearing within Iyerre’s
region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was still in the process of warping through spacetime at maximum
speed, his heart burning with impatience.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I win, I’ll be the master of this Chaosverse.” Iyerre was filled
with eagerness. Suddenly… “Eh? What’s going on? W-why can’t I
warp through spacetime any longer?” Iyerre turned pale. Spacetime
had suddenly turned incredibly stable around him, making it
impossible for him to tear through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
white-robed youth with a black sheath on his back suddenly appeared
out of nowhere. He said in a cold voice, “Iyerre!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
terrifying aura of might descended, completely surrounding and
freezing Iyerre in his tracks. Iyerre could no longer even move a
finger. He stared at the distant Ning in horror: “Y-you already…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
I’ve already bound my homeland to myself. From this day forward, I
shall be the one to protect it,” Ning said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist!” A voice suddenly rang out from afar, traversing past
spacetime and reaching out all the way to Ning’s Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that Ning had already bound this Chaosverse, he was able to sense
this voice. He turned to stare off into the distance, the ‘membrane’
surrounding the Chaosverse no longer able to bar his gaze. He stared
through spacetime and deep into the Infinite Void, following the
reverberations of the voice to find its source. He saw a skinny,
horned, azure-robed figure standing atop a giant boulder. The horned
figure had a warm gaze and a smile on his face. “Fellow Daoist,
please spare my disciple’s life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Ning’s Chaosverse. Ning turned his cold gaze back to Iyerre, his
endless aura of might having completely suppressed the Omega Autarch.
Iyerre wasn’t able to move so much as a finger. He couldn’t even
blink or speak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die,”
Ning said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Iyerre was still staring fixedly at Ning, but his body began to
completely break apart. Even his soul was completely disintegrated,
transforming into pure energy which was absorbed by the Chaosverse.
This surge of energy was so tremendous that it surpassed the combined
energies of a hundred ordinary Autarchs. The entire Chaosverse’s
aura strengthened noticeably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Autarch Iyerre. Dead!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist!” The distant horned man atop the giant boulder in the
Infinite Void could sense his Chaosverse weakening dramatically. He
couldn’t help but let out a sigh. “</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Was
that really necessary? You are already a Lord of Chaos and can revive
all those who died. Why did you have to…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
wanted to save him?” Ning remained within his Chaosverse, and his
own voice echoed out into the Infinite Void and into the ears of the
horned man. The horned man could sense the icy hostility in Ning’s
voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
wanted to save him? But if he had won, all living creatures in our
entire civilization would have perished. Who would have come to save
us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
icy, hostile voice continued to echo within the horned man’s ears.
“And, Sithe Chaoslord… are you going to tell me that you didn’t
help him with his schemes? Don’t try to play innocent in front of
me.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_45_Chapter_017__The"></A>
Chapter 17: The End (Part 2)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist Darknorth, I admit that I did act in a rather untoward
fashion, but the path of cultivation is an inherently selfish path.
We fight our way to the top, do we not? Your Chaosverse was the
weakest of all Chaosverses, so my disciple naturally chose to try and
make it his own. The war is now over, and he is dead. You are now a
Lord of Chaos. Let us let bygones be bygones. What do you say?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned, azure-robed man completely understood how Ji Ning was feeling
right now, and so he continued to speak in a gentle and friendly
voice, “You now stand at the very peak of civilization, after all.
We each are in control of our respective Chaosverses, and neither of
us can do anything to the other. What’s the point of holding
grudges?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
let out a cold snort, then retracted his gaze and broke the link. The
horned man just chuckled, not angry in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning stood within the emptiness of space, staring at the
treasures which the deceased Iyerre had left behind. He used his
godsense to sweep through all of the treasures and inspect them.
“Given that Iyerre dared to return, he probably had something he
was counting on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.
Was it this tablet?” Ning discovered the Stele of Mountains and
Rivers. It looked quite ordinary, but when Ning gave it a closer
inspection he was rather startled. The internal intricacies made him
sigh in amazement. “This should have been created by the Sithe Lord
of Chaos. Otherwise, Iyerre would’ve used it long ago. It truly is
incredible. This Lord of Chaos is an absolute marvel when it comes to
artificing, and this item is of some use to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black warbeasts had little meaning for Ning, but the Stele of
Mountains and Rivers was of fairly significant use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
stele can allow me to instantly release an enormous amount of mana in
a terrifying strike that vastly surpasses my normal maximums.
Incredible. Although I cannot bind it, it’ll still be of great use
to me in improving my own artificing skills.” Ning willed the six
Northbow swords on his back to all enter his heartworld. By now, his
vast heartworld was completely identical to the real world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the heartworld, Ning could make anything ‘real’ with but a
thought. He could even manufacture a hundred or more Northbow swords
in the blink of an eye, but he would have to pay an enormous price in
energy!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble.
The Northbow swords began to transform within the heartworld.
Everything was as Ning willed it to be. He first transformed their
quintessences into his Autarch Omega Sword Dao, then remade the
physical properties of the swords as well, infusing some of the
insights he had gained from the Stele of Mountains and Rivers into
his Northbow swords. At critical moments, his swords would now be
able to unleash incredible attacks that vastly surpassed their normal
might. Although the difference wasn’t as ridiculous as that granted
by the Stele of Mountains and Rivers, it still replicated 30% of the
effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
that same instant, his avatar began to remake the Northmoon swords
within its own heartworld. His avatar had been reinforced and
nourished by the power of the entire Chaosverse and was thus at 80%
of the true Ning’s power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
a Lord of Chaos, but I have yet to really explore the outside world.
I can only relax after fully understanding this universe.” Ning was
a bit nervous from the repeated invasions, and so he was filled with
wariness and vigilance towards the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
would send his avatar out, rather than his true body. The Sithe Lord
of Chaos only had an avatar in the outside world as well. Their
avatars had roughly 80% of their full power, and once they died they
could swiftly be remade. They were perfect for sending out and
exploring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
take a look and see what mysteries the Infinite Void holds within
it.” The sword-bearing golden-robed Ning exited his Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden-robed Ning began to wander through the endlessly dazzling
Infinite Void. This place was filled with distorted spacetime and
many enormous celestial objects, as well as countless strange beings.
When they encountered the golden-robed Ning, they were filled with
utter terror. This was merely Ning’s avatar, but it carried with it
the mighty aura of an entire Chaosverse. This was why Lords of Chaos
were so terrifying and why Iyerre was so desperate to become one. A
single glance from them was enough to suppress and kill an Omega
Autarch. The difference in power was simply too great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are a total of nine Chaosverses, and they are the largest of
celestial objects here. The others are all much smaller. Countless
celestial objects, scattered throughout the Infinite Void… and
spacetime here is completely chaotic.” The golden-robed Ning began
to understand. “It’s just too large, and every single spacetime
continuum is different. I could spend ten million chaos cycles
exploring without being able to fully investigate the entire Infinite
Void. The Infinite Void is also changing constantly; there’s no
point in even trying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
homeland and the enormous Chaosverses… where did they come from?”
If he wasn’t able to investigate the entire Infinite Void, he
wanted to at least understand his own past and the source of the
Chaosverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning stared off into the distance. The enormous Chaosverse that was
his home was within his field of vision, as was another vast
Chaosverse. Chaosverses were so enormous that they loomed large from
even incredible distances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Reverse.”
Ning willed time to flow backwards. Rumble… time quickly came to a
halt and began to reverse, displaying the countless scenes that had
occurred in the past. This sort of ‘temporal inversion’ technique
generally required very little energy. In the Three Realms, even weak
Immortals and Fiendgods were capable of using such a technique.
However, he was applying the technique to an absolutely enormous
region which covered two Chaosverses, resulting in a similarly
tremendous expenditure of energy. His own energies were rapidly
depleted, but the prime energies of his Chaosverse sent more and more
to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was another reason why Chaoslords were so incredible. They could
unleash as much power as they wanted! So long as they didn’t
unleash more power than their Chaosverses’ would naturally
regenerate, they essentially had access to truly unlimited energy.
Their Chaosverses would also draw upon energy from the Infinite Void
at an incredible rate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Faster,
faster! I want to see more!” The golden-robed Ning stared towards
the two Chaosverses as time continued to reverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, Ning saw those two distant Chaosverses explode. “Eh?!”
Ning immediately halted the temporal inversion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
wasn’t an actual explosion. Time continued to slowly flow forwards,
allowing Ning to view everything clearly. The actual scene… was of
countless different streams of matter and energy slowly coming
together to form an enormous Chaosverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
the Chaosverses were actually formed by countless amounts of matter
and energy coming together?” Ning nodded. This made sense. He
continued the temporal inversion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Suddenly, Ning noticed something special. The matter and energy which
had ‘exploded’ outwards came together to form many celestial
objects of various size, with the nine Chaosverses being the largest.
“So all matter actually came from that direction over there?”
Ning immediately turned his gaze to the location where all this
matter had come from.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
inverted at the point where he focused his gaze, staring at the place
where all this matter had come from.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once,
long ago, a single absolutely enormous landmass had existed across an
incredibly wide area within the Infinite Void. This landmass was
absolutely, inconceivably sized. It vastly surpassed any Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an enormous landmass! Is this where everything came from?” the
golden-robed Ning immediately began to move closer to that region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah.
He’s discovered it?” The thin, horned man atop that levitating
boulder watched from afar. When Ning began to move towards the
location where that landmass had been, the horned man’s heart
clenched. He then immediately began to warp over there as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning arrived at the location of the vast landmass, time began to
reverse once more. The scenes of what had once occurred within that
vast landmass began to replay in front of Ning. This world had been
far vaster than any Chaosverse, and it also held far more living
beings within it, including countless living beings and countless
races.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
lively.” Ning watched the lives of those countless beings being
replayed before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Suddenly, the vast landmass began to crack apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
traitors! TRAITORS!” A towering, black-robed emperor who emanated
an aura of incredible power was surrounded by over a hundred figures
of tremendous might. These figures all had different appearances,
including both humans and beasts, and their blows were filled with
incredible strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Traitors?
You enslaved us! Should all of our hard work been meant for nothing
save to serve as your eternal slaves?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
you thought that the seal you placed on our truesouls would enable
you to control us unto our deaths. You fool! In the end, you are
nothing more than this continent’s will incarnate. You are no true
cultivator! You have no idea how formidable Omega Autarchs are. We
escaped your control long ago. We simply put on an act and bided our
time!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been waiting for so long, while brother Heavencloud poured all his
effort into creating this Grand Armageddon Formation to deal with
you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning didn’t understand what the experts of this era were saying,
through watching the battle he was able to tell what level the
hundred-plus experts were at, as well as the black-robed emperor’s
level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning was shocked by the battle occurring before him. “The attackers
are all Omega Autarchs!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were a total of 129 experts attacking the black-robed emperor, and
all of them were Omega Autarchs. They had joined together into an
incredibly complex formation. Even though Ning was also an Omega
Autarch, he felt that he was incapable of truly understanding it. He
had the vague feeling that it had probably been created by someone
who had reached Omega Autarchy via the Dao of Formations. This was
why the formation was able to allow over a hundred Omega Autarchs to
fuse their energies together perfectly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can there be this many Omega Autarchs?” Ning was rather stunned.
“Although each blow from that black-robed emperor is filled with
awesome power, he’s actually at a lower level of insight than them.
He doesn’t seem to be an Omega Autarch. He’s at a lower level,
yet can contend with 129 of them by himself?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A second figure warped through spacetime and appeared next to Ning.
It was the horned, azure-robed man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?”
Ning glanced at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is our first time actually meeting, I believe.” The horned man
smiled. “I am Alphan of the Sithe Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
blinked. He suddenly realized that his Chaosverse didn’t have a
name yet. There were nine of them, after all; it wouldn’t be
appropriate to keep calling his ‘the Chaosverse’. What name
should he choose for it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
thought back to his homeland, of the many living beings who had
struggled within the Chaosverse to clamber upwards on the path of
cultivation. So many forerunners had helped clear the way, cutting
their way through thistles and thorns as they blazed a path through
the wilderness. Their efforts had finally culminated in Ning’s
success, allowing their Chaosverse to enter a new stage of
development.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Desolate
Chaosverse, Ji Ning.” Ning looked at the horned man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Desolate…
Ji Ning?” the horned man murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
have you come here?” Ning felt nothing but ill-will towards this
horned man, and so he came straight to the point.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned man pointed at the scene of the great battle which had
occurred in the past. “In this era, the vast landmass before us
ended up being destroyed by the battle we are now watching. After
breaking apart, its energy and its matter ended up forming many
celestial objects within the Infinite Void, with the largest being
our nine Chaosverses.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply listened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
black-robed emperor was the continent’s will incarnate. Its
Quintessence was far more powerful than those in our Chaosverses, and
as a result it reached a level of such power that it actually gained
true sentience,” the horned man said. “The will of the landmass
governed itself and all of the living beings with it. Once a
cultivator succeeded in the Daomerge and broke through to become an
Eternal Emperor, it would set down a seal upon that cultivator’s
truesoul which allowed it to take full control over that cultivator’s
life and death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
it was nothing more than a psychic being which arose from the prime
essences, it only understood the various Eternal Omega Daos. It
didn’t understand what an Autarch Omega Dao was! However, it had
the power of the entire continent behind it, and so it remained
invincible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
and more living beings arose within this continent. Omega Autarchs
eventually began to rise, but even after reaching Omega Autarchy they
were still unable to extricate themselves from that seal. One… two…
three… more and more Omega Autarchs began to appear. Finally, an
incredibly powerful Omega Autarch managed to devise a method to solve
the seal, and he secretly passed it over to the other Omega
Autarchs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to listen silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look.
That’s him over there.” The horned man pointed towards a
white-haired man who was amongst the attackers. “His name was Grand
Sovereign Crimson Wind, and he was one of nine Grand Sovereigns under
the command of that black-robed emperor who was responsible for
helping the emperor manage the entire landmass. He was the one who
solved the seal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Later,
the Omega Autarch of Formations known as Heavencloud managed to
develop an absolutely terrifying formation, the ‘Grand Armageddon
Formation’.” The horned man pointed at another man who was bald.
“He was the black-robed emperor’s Sentinel for the seventh
universe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seventh
universe?” Ning suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might not have noticed yet, but that landmass actually has a total of
thirty-two universes circling around it. Each of them is roughly on
par with our own Chaosverses in size,” the horned man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “You know quite a lot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’ve inverted time to watch the history of this era before us on
many an occasion. I’ve even learned their language,” the horned
man chuckled. “By now, I’m familiar with all of these Omega
Autarchs and their backgrounds. I even know how they each rose to
power and what they experienced. I can’t help but sigh. The end
result of that battle was the maddened emperor destroying the entire
landmass and causing all of the Omega Autarchs to die with him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
saw it as well. That final, great explosion… it had claimed the
lives of that terrifying psychic being and all 129 Omega Autarchs. In
fact, all the living beings on that landmass had died, while the
thirty-two universes orbiting it had been annihilated as well. It had
been an absolutely enormous explosion! The entire Infinite Void had
been wiped clean of all life thanks to that explosion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning listened to the horned man speak, he continued to watch the
temporal inversion and see the history of this land. The great
landmass had been around for far too long. As Ning continued to watch
backwards he gradually began to learn and understand its language,
and he also began to grow familiar with the deceased Omega Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, the black-robed emperor’s Sentinel for the nineteenth
universe had been named Autarch Cloudsoar. He had also been an
Autarch of the Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed emperor’s Sentinel for the third universe, ‘Autarch
Yin-Yang’, had been an incomparably muscular old bull whose body
was completely black.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
various experts all had their own areas of expertise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
in my homeland the ‘will’ of the Quintessence simply acts on
instinct, rather than gaining a sense of self and thus becoming a
true living being.” The more Ning saw, the more frightened he
became. All living beings on that continent had been slaves to the
black-robed emperor, unable to extricate themselves until the day of
the final battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow backwards to the earliest days before life had even
arisen. There, the temporal inversion came to a halt. It was
impossible to go backwards any farther.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
reached the end. Time can no longer move backwards,” the horned man
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. All the images before him vanished, and the space in front of
him went back to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning stared in front of him, only to see that a universe had appeared
in the location where that vast landmass had been. The universe was
slowly draining energy and matter from the surrounding area. Clearly,
it was still in the growing phase and had yet to truly form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
The golden-robed Ning took a step forwards, appearing before that
universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning.” The horned man’s heart clenched as he immediately followed
from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
godsense instantly swept out to enter the slowly-forming universe.
Inside, he saw nothing but raw chaos. There was no life within it at
all. “How odd. The old era ended long ago, while the other
Chaosverses have all been formed. This one, however, has not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everything
is possible within the Infinite Void,” the horned man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is developing quite slowly,” Ning said with a smile. “Judging
from what I saw when I inverted time, this place must have begun to
accumulate matter ever since that great explosion had occurred.
However… despite all that time having passed, it still can’t even
come close to comparing to our Chaosverses. In my homeland, generally
speaking the slower something grows, the more terrifying it will
become when it finally matures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned man’s heart trembled, but his face remained calm. “Oh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not lying to you,” Ning smiled. Indeed. The legends of ‘Nezha’
had him in his mother’s womb for three years and six months before
being born. Ning’s own daughter, Brightmoon, had been in the womb
for five years and two months before emerging.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have the feeling that this universe is taking shape far too slowly…
and it is located exactly where the original landmass was.” Ning
chuckled. “It might grow to become even more powerful than our
Chaosverses.” Ning was connecting all the dots together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
That landmass completely blew apart. Most of its matter came to form
our nine Chaosverses. The remaining amount of matter couldn’t
possibly form a stronger universe,” the horned man said
confidently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Makes
sense.” Ning glanced at the horned man, then drew a Northmoon sword
from his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clink!
The sword sliced through the Infinite Void, radiating a sharp light
as it chopped down at the slowly-growing universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
that!” The horned man immediately reached out, his arm expanding
tremendously as he blocked Ning’s sword-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two attacks collided. The horned man’s robes tore apart, revealing
a skinny but incomparably tough right arm which was completely
undamaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
are you doing, Ji Ning?” the horned man asked angrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroying
it, of course,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is a perfectly fine universe which poses no threat to us at all. Why
are you going to destroy it?” the horned man asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“At
first, I was just curious about it, since it was located where the
original landmass was and grew very slowly. As I said, in own
homeland, the slower something develops the more powerful it becomes…
but when you kept on rebutting what I said, I had the feeling that
something was wrong. I thought I’d give it a try, and as I thought,
you moved to block me.” Ning chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned man instantly felt regret upon hearing this. He wanted Ning to
feel that this was nothing more than an ordinary universe, but
instead he had put Ning on his guard. It must be remembered that
Ning’s avatar had exited his Chaosverse filled with suspicion
towards anything and everything which could be a threat to it. He had
the feeling that this small universe was rather unusual; testing it
out was a very normal reaction. For the horned man to stop him meant
that something was afoot. If the horned man didn’t stop him? Well,
destroying a celestial object which held no life didn’t really
matter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The golden-robed Ning once more charged towards that Chaosverse,
chopping out with his divine sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t!
I’ll tell you the secret!” the horned man called out hurriedly
while blocking. “I discovered this by accident over many years of
observation. If any other Chaoslords arise in the future, don’t
tell them this secret! This universe is very unique in many ways.
Although it isn’t that large, it is quite marvelous. Let me
explain!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
amount of honeyed words could dissuade Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“BREAK!”
Ning’s eyes flickered with destructive light. He manifested three
heads and six arms, each of his hands holding onto a Northmoon sword.
Sword-light flashed in an utterly indomitable matter as he summoned
the vast power of his entire Chaosverse. The horned man grew quite
desperate. Darknorth was an Omega Autarch of the Sword, the most
offensive type of Omega Autarch. Alphan would be able to withstand
Ning’s attack, but there was no way he could completely negate it
and prevent any of it from harming the small universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaar!”
The horned man suddenly changed form, becoming an incomparably vast
and muscular black bull. Beneath the bull’s hooves appeared the
enormous diagram of a Yin-Yang.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is you? The Sentinel for the third universe, ‘Autarch Yin-Yang’?”
Ning recognized this form. So the horned man was actually one of the
129 Omega Autarchs who had surrounded and assaulted the black-robed
emperor! “You didn’t die?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bull had clearly died in the images Ning had seen during the temporal
inversion. Ning instantly realized that a grand secret had to be
connected to this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit!”
The old black bull grew even more panicked and angry. “So long as
I’m here, you can forget about destroying it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The golden-robed Ning began to battle against the old
black bull next to that new universe. The shockwaves from this battle
blasted out in every direction. The old black bull had been alive
since the ancient era, and his body had been tempered and forged to
become the most terrifying machine warbeast possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he was an Omega Autarch of the Sword, well-suited to combat
and slaughter. More importantly, he wasn’t trying to attack the
black bull. He was trying to destroy the universe. The Sithe
Chaoslord had been willing to reveal his identity in order to protect
that universe, which made Ning all the more aware of its importance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
destroy it! It will bring many benefits!” the black bull tried to
dissuade Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break
for me!” Ning continued to launch berserk attacks. He poured an
enormous amount of energy into his Northmoon swords. Now that they
had been reforged, they had a function akin to the Stele of Mountains
and Rivers, allowing him to unleash desperation attacks of tremendous
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
old black bull suddenly felt a sense of danger which caused him to
blanche. He had been the one to give Iyerre the Stele of Mountains
and Rivers. Now, it was coming back to bite him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Six absolutely horrifying streaks of
destructive sword-light pierced through the void. The old black bull
was unable to completely block them, and so he could do nothing but
watch in agony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Five
streaks of sword-light tore into that universe. The universe was
quite weak and not yet fully-formed. This desperation attack from a
Lord of Chaos caused its incomplete Quintessence to be completely
torn apart, resulting in the universe shuddering and beginning to
crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“N-no…!”
the old black howled angrily. He returned to his first, azure-robed
form and stared at the scene before him in despair. “Why? Why did
you have to destroy it?!” the horned man stared at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t care how ‘marvelous’ it will become in the future. Now
that I’ve destroyed it, it will never pose a threat,” Ning said.
“There’s no need for you to say too many things to me. I won’t
trust you no matter what you say. Who knows if you are telling the
truth or not? The only thing I know is that I will destroy any and
all threats to my home. That way, there won’t be another senseless
war in the future. I’m satisfied with being a Lord of Chaos. I
don’t have any ambition of invading other Chaosverses and
conquering them. All I want to do is safeguard my own home.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
speaking, Ning turned and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
horned man stared as the golden-robed Ning left, filled with utter
agony. Back within the Sithe Chaosverse, his true body was holding
onto a stone tablet which had the words ‘World’ and ‘Set’ on
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“During
the last era, we failed at the very end. The entire landmass was
destroyed, but I was lucky enough to acquire the deceased emperor’s
‘Worldsetter Stele’. I hid a fragment of my truesoul within it,
and as a result I managed to survive. I was delivered into a
Chaosverse and ended up becoming its Lord of Chaos.” The horned
bull was in a state of utter agony. “Once that growing universe
became truly complete, it could become one with the Worldsetter
Stele. When that happened, I would have a chance of ascending to…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
gone. It’s all gone.” The horned man gradually began to calm
down. What was done was done. There was no way to reverse it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
I was being too stubborn. I am a Lord of Chaos and completely
invincible in the Infinite Void. Why do I have to become even more
powerful?” The horned man gradually came to his senses. He had been
enslaved for so long during the previous era that he had an almost
maniacal desire to become stronger, to stand at the top and rule
others so that none would ever rule him again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
this was a new era, an era that was different from the previous era.
When Ning destroyed that budding universe, it meant that the old
landmass would never be reborn. He had lost his chance… but as a
result, he was now truly free.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
free now. There’s nothing left to fight over.” The horned man
began to fly back towards his own Chaosverse. “No ambition… only
wishes to safeguard his own home… Desolate… Ji Ning? Mm. A
Chaoslord like him is decent company.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
golden-robed avatar established an estate within the Infinite Void.
It would permanently reside here, occasionally going out and
wandering about. He couldn’t guarantee that no dangers would
appear, but he would do his utmost to protect his home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Desolate Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning stood there within empty space, flanked by Autarch
Bolin and Autarch Ekong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
back, brother Titanos.” Ning smiled. Instantly, countless specks of
light began to appear. Ning was virtually omnipotent within his own
Chaosverse. He had been able to see everything within Autarch
Titanos’ truesoul, and thus he was able to remake it out of the
void and call it back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
old man with two fleshy antennae on his head slowly began to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
just happened to me?!” Autarch Titanos stared at Ning, Ekong, and
Bolin in shock. “Darknorth, y-you… didn’t I die? Wasn’t my
truesoul devoured?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Calm
down,” Bolin laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait
a while,” Ekong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled as well. “Give me just a few moments, brother Titanos.” As
he spoke, countless flecks of light began to assemble next to him yet
again. This time, they resolved into Autarch Mogg. Next came Autarch
Stonerule and Autarch Skyfeeder. After that came the refined, relaxed
Autarch Awakener… and last came the ancient-looking Autarch
Entropos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
eight Autarchs had been gathered together. The eight Autarchs who had
arisen within the Desolate Chaosverse had finally been reunited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is Darknorth.” Autarch Bolin made the introductions, a smile on his
face. “He trained in the Omega Sword Dao and used it to reach Omega
Autarchy, binding our entire Chaosverse to himself. As a result, he
was able to bring you all back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Darknorth?” Autarch Entropos stared at Ning, wide-eyed. Autarch
Awakener felt rather curious, as he felt a close connection between
himself and Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Actually,
it can be said that Autarch Awakener helped guide me on my path,”
Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
began to chat amongst themselves. All of them were amazed at the
twists and turns of fate. They had died, and yet they were now back!
The guidance which Autarch Awakener has provided to Ning had been
critically important. Without his guidance, Ning probably wouldn’t
have been able to understand the Eternal Omega Sword Dao. And now,
after becoming a Lord of Chaos, Ning was able to revive Autarch
Awakener. It was all so interesting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
far too many of our Hegemons and Emperors have died during the two
wars we fought. They fought to the death for the sake of our entire
Chaosverse. I have to bring them all back as well,” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The entire Chaosverse seemed to tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-what
just happened to me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Didn’t
I die?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
am I?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemons
and Emperors began to come back to life throughout the Chaosverse,
all of them rather stunned. Their final memories were of the moments
before their deaths. Ning had viewed the past of this entire
Chaosverse and knew each and every Hegemon and Emperor. He revived
everyone who had died in battle, including the ones he recognized
such as his own disciple, ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding. He also
revived some of the friends he had encountered when wandering the
Chaosverse after failing his Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
powerful experts had all been brought back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth…
will such a large-scale resurrection be bad for this Chaosverse?”
Autarch Titanos asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry,” Ning laughed. “Even after being revived, they remain a
part of the Chaosverse. The actual amount of energy which has been
permanently lost due to the revival process is quite low. For
example, reviving the six of you cost roughly the amount of energy a
single Autarch contains within him. Reviving all these Hegemons and
Emperors didn’t cost too much at all. I can handle it with ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
really mattered very little. Iyerre’s death alone had granted their
Chaosverse more than a hundred Autarchs worth of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
chatting with the eight Autarchs, Ning departed and went back to the
Three Realms. Ning’s emotions towards the Three Realms were the
deepest of all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa,
Subhuti, Maitreya, Kuafu, Crazy Ji… all of them had received mental
messages from Ning. They were his old friends, and now all of them
were standing by his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Return
to us.” With but a thought, Ning brought back the Three Realms of
old. Countless specks of light began to gather, resulting in
countless figures emerging within it. These were the Immortals and
Fiendgods of the Three Realms who had died in the Endwar against Old
Man Yuan and the Seamless Gate, as well as those who had died even
earlier. Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Buddha
Jueming, Suiren, Shennong, Fuxi, Lord Everwood, senior
apprentice-brother Houyi, Gonggong, Daoist Threelives…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
Immortals and Fiendgods were brought back to life. Many friends were
reunited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Tathagata,
Maitreya, Ananda… these old friends of the Buddhist Sangha all
gathered together. As for the Daoist Way? Three Purities, Daofather
Carefree, Lu Dongbin, and the others all gathered together as well,
with those who had survived the Endwar narrating what had happened
afterwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Too
many people. Too many stories. All of them had been brought back to
life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Houyi held Chang’e by the hand, walking over
to stand before Ning. “Thank you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
Eldest apprentice-brother, spend some time chatting with my
sister-in-law. Don’t waste any time on me,” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Ning walked over to Daoist Threelives, who looked rather hesitant
even though the big yellow bear next to him nodded encouragingly.
Daoist Threelives was normally a very straightforward and heroic
figure, but when he spoke to Subhuti and his other old friends he
quickly learned just how incredible Ji Ning was. Ji Ning was someone
completely omnipotent, capable of controlling life and death, and
able to link past, present, and future together. And… Ji Ning was
his disciple? Although he was nominally Ning’s master, this was
their first time actually meeting each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Uh.
Hi there, Darknorth,” Daoist Threelives said rather hesitantly.
This was their first meeting, and the two didn’t really share the
relationship which a master and disciple should. This was something
which took time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t try to force things. He turned, staring off into the
distance. All the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms had
been brought back to life. They were all reunited now, sharing their
stories with each other. It would be years before things calmed down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately retreated, vanishing without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
arrived back at the Black-White College of Stillwater Province,
located within the Grand Xia major world of the Three Realms. Since
Ning had remade the entire Three Realms with his will alone, the
Grand Xia was currently devoid of life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning walked over to the Dao Debate Palace of
the Black-White College. He had left her for last. She was going to
be revived by herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
back to me, senior apprentice-sister.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
specks of light began to appear. They appeared unspeakably beautiful
and graceful, and they gathered together into the form of the young,
black-robed Yu Wei. As more and more truesoul fragments gathered,
life appeared within Yu Wei’s eyes. She stared at Ning, who looked
back into the eyes of his senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning and the black-robed Yu Wei simply stared at each
other in silence. As the final piece of her truesoul fragment
returned, Yu Wei regained all of her memories and she began to emit
the aura of true life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?” Yu Wei couldn’t believe it. Her final
memories were of the war-torn Three Realms and her death at the hands
of the Godking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning stepped forward, gently taking his wife
into his arms. He simply held her, inhaling into her hair and
smelling her sweet fragrance. This scent had become a dusty memory
that had lain dormant for many years. Ning felt intoxicated by it. He
had trained and fought and bled for so long, but it was all worth it.
This single instant… it surpassed all of eternity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Yu
Wei hugged Ning back. She was still rather confused. Her memories had
‘jumped’ from her death in the Three Realms war to the present
day. She didn’t know what Ning had experienced, but she knew that
Ning must have made many, many sacrifices in order to bring her back
to life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally
Ning released Yu Wei, but he continued to hold her by the hand. He
pointed at the area around them. “Senior apprentice-sister,
remember this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course I do. This is the Dao Debate Palace. We had a little
competition here, and you lost,” Yu Wei teased. Suddenly, she
couldn’t help but ask, “Junior apprentice-brother… can you tell
me what has happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
sit down and talk it over.” Ning pulled Yu Wei over to sit down
atop a dais before the Dao Debate Palace, then began to explain.
“During that battle, you were killed by the Godking…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
talked for a long, long time. He narrated the end of the war for the
Three Realms, his journey to the Badlands Territory, his abduction by
Hegemon Brightshore, and even his adventure into that otherverse. He
explained how he came to understand the Omega Sword Dao and then used
it to become a Daolord of the First Step, Second Step…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
told of his adventures in the Terror Starsea, of how he fought to
acquire a Voidsea Jadeseal within the Waveshift Realm, of his battles
against Archons of the Sacred Cities, and even him acquiring the
Flamewing God and then begging Autarch Titanos to bring her back to
life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was heartbroken when I failed in that attempt.” Ning pointed
towards an area up ahead. “I got completely drunk, right over
there. I fell asleep on the snow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
but a thought, Ning caused snow to flutter down around them. Ning and
Yu Wei gazed at the beautiful snowscape, while Ning said with a
smile, “It’s actually quite odd. I was heartbroken, which is why
the snow fell… but now when I see the snow, I feel very happy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Yu
Wei didn’t say anything. She just tightly held onto Ning’s hand.
She herself felt heart-aching pain ever since Ning had begun his
tale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to narrate his story. “Afterwards, I attempted the
Daomerge. Unfortunately, I failed.” He explained of his hunt for
Nuwa, his meeting with the five Autarchs, and how he had gone into
the Sithelands to save the Paragon of Pills. He told of how he had
found the [Five Truncheon Chapters] within that hidden world, and in
the end managed to complete the [Void Everlasting] technique which
gave him an imperishable truesoul. He told her of how he had become
an Omega Emperor, and of the war which the Sithe had unleashed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
won that final battle. I broke through and took the final step on my
path.” Ning smiled as he looked at Yu Wei. “We won, and so
everything I wanted became real. All my old friends came back to
life… and of course, so did you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Yu
Wei looked at Ning. She truly couldn’t imagine how Ning could’ve
experienced so many things since her death in the Three Realms. It
had been just a blink of an eye for her. She felt pained at all he
had suffered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look.”
Ning pointed forwards. In front of the Dao Debate Palace, a plum
blossom suddenly emerged from the fallen snow, releasing its sweet
fragrance as it bloomed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
my past life on Earth, there was a saying in my homeland: ‘Only
after enduring the bone-chilling cold shall you smell the fragrance
of the plum blossom.’” Ning laughed loudly. “I’ve endured the
bone-chilling cold. Now, I finally can smell the fragrance of the
plum blossom.” As he spoke, he pressed his nose against Yu Wei’s
face and gave her a sniff, then said in an absolutely shameless
manner, “Mm, plum blossom. It smells so good.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
plum blossoms continued to emerge from the snow before the Dao Debate
Palace. As for Ning and Yu Wei, they continued to sit there atop the
dais. They had so many stories to share with each other, including
stories of their daughter. Ning had many things he wanted to tell
her, and Yu Wei wanted to hear them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Three Realms. A great banquet, the likes of which had never been seen
before, was being hosted here on this day. Lord of Chaos Ji Ning,
also known as Autarch Darknorth, was personally hosting this banquet.
The eight Autarchs and countless Hegemons and Emperors who had fought
in the war had all been teleported here by Ning to take part in this
feast. This was also a victory feast for them, after having won the
war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was seated at the highest position, while his wife Yu Wei was next to
him. To each side of them were the eight Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Below
them, there was no further division of rank. It was a veritable sea
of Hegemons and Emperors! As for Subhuti, Nuwa, Brightmoon, and the
other leaders of the Three Realms, they had a section all their own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
major powers used this banquet to discuss the Dao with each other,
and there was much merry-making and rejoicing. Many of the
cultivators brought painters, musicians, and other talented
entertainers to spread joy amongst each other!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
never imagined that this day would come,” Buddha Ksitigarbha said
with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
I never would’ve thought that I’d have a disciple like Autarch
Darknorth! I never even taught him!” Daoist Threelives roared
happily while drinking some wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Okay,
now you are just blatantly showing off,” Crimsonbright remarked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what if I am?” Daoist Threelives mock-glared at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Houyi
and Chang’e were seated together. Houyi no longer looked like the
quiet, forlorn woodcutter of old. His spirit and bravado had been
aroused once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the other side were ‘Azure Bamboo’ Yang Quding and Hegemon
Dawnclear, who were together again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first pair belonged to the ‘Three Realms Allliance’, while the
second pair included Ning’s personal disciple. They were all seated
close to each other, and both duos smiled and nodded at each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
you are Brightshore? I heard you actually abducted Autarch Darknorth
long ago?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Hegemon Brightshore was a famous man. There were many Hegemons
and Emperors who wished to befriend him. He chortled, “Haha, yes. I
have to say, I was lucky. Who would’ve thought that when I
swallowed that batch of cultivators, I would end up abducting the man
who would become Autarch Darknorth? Haha. It was luck! Luck!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
telling you guys, me and Darknorth are like brothers! I could tell
from the very first moment I saw him that he was something special.”
Ninedust was busy bragging to the other Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills and her ‘big brother’ were together, beaming
happily as they took part in the feast. When their gazes met with
Ning’s, both sides raised their goblets in toasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was a truly grand celebration with oceans of food and drink. The
Immortals and Fiendgods all made merry in this truly unprecedented
gathering, while the major powers who put on performances did their
utmost to please.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Yu Wei sat up high, staring down at the many cultivators below
them. Ning saw his father Ji Yichuan, his mother Yuchi Snow, his
daughter Ji Brightmoon, and her Dao-companion Stonepool. He saw Uncle
White, Autumn Leaf, Little Qing, and many other friends from his
earliest days. He saw all the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three
Realms, and the countless major powers he had encountered on his
path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alphan…
Sithe…” Ning silently shook his head. “What’s the point of
fighting? Being strong enough to protect those we care about is
enough.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned, his gaze intersecting with Yu Wei’s. “I want to kiss
you,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
too many people here!” Yu Wei was shocked. “No way. No way! Wait
for the feast to be over.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be afraid. Your husband is the Lord of Chaos. So long as I will it,
they won’t see a thing.” Ning lowered his head, burying himself
in Yu Wei’s lips.</P>

Afterword</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whew.
It’s over. Nearly two and a half years have passed, starting from
Dec 16, 2012 until today, April 10, 2015. Our journey through the
[Desolate Era] is finally over. The enormous [Desolate Era] started
with our Ji Ning stumbling through the Netherworld Kingdom into his
next reincarnated life, and now we can finally put a final period on
this story.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
is the seventh novel which Tomatoes has written. [Legend of the
Astral Peaks], [Inch of Radiance], [Stellar Transformations],
[Coiling Dragon], [The Nine Cauldrons], [Swallowed Star] came before
it. This has been the seventh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">[Desolate
Era] has had games and anime made based off of it, with the first
episode of the anime already released. It was a bit slow at first due
to a lack of familiarity, but starting from the third episode it
should speed up quickly. It should stabilize at roughly an episode a
week and will continue to be broadcast. A TV series is about to start
shooting as well, and it’ll go on satellite television. We’re
also preparing for a movie, but [Desolate Era] will require a large
amount of investment and so it will be a while in the coming.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whew.
Two and a half years. Haha, two and a half years is a very long
period of time! My son was born, and now he can actually recite
poetry. I’m speechless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for this novel I spent two and a half years writing? At first,
everything was so smooth and easy. I was fired up and filled with
energy, and the letters just kept flowing. However, towards the
middle/late parts of the novel, I was just too tired, especially
after I went past 2 million characters. I felt as though I was a
marathon runner who had reached his limit and at the verge of
collapse. I worked until very late at night, every night, burning the
midnight oil and tearing my hair out to think about what to write.
Sometimes I couldn’t even be bothered to shower. I was a man
possessed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">I
was most tired during the latter half of last year. The pressure was
tremendous, and the need to write two chapters a day resulted in the
plot being imperfect. I tried to force myself to think and to post
new chapters, and I nearly went mad from it all. There were several
times, late at night last year, where I felt my heartrate speeding up
so rapidly that I thought that I might die at any moment. I managed
to force myself to last until January, at which point I gritted my
teeth and said ‘Screw it’, slowing down to one chapter a day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
made things much easier for me. My mental energies quickly began to
recover, and I feel as though my physical conditioning has improved
by 50%, haha.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">I
poured my blood, sweat, and tears into [Desolate Era]. It feels like
part of my life itself. Now that I’m done writing it, I feel
relaxed. Finally, I can take a long break… but at the same time, I
feel a bit reluctant to part with it. My emotions are quite
complicated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
matter what, [Desolate Era] is over! This book is done, and I had a
smile on my face as I wrote the grand finale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mm.
As for what’s next? A new book, of course!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
new book will be set in a strange and mysterious continent. It’ll
be a completely different type of book, one which I’ve never
written before. In fact, the cultivation system within it will be
unlike any other I’ve worked on! Haha. I’ve been a novel writer
for nearly ten years, after all. I need to find my breakthrough! All
I want to say is that I’ll use all of my emotions to write this new
novel, pouring all of my ardor into it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course… now that I’ve finished [Desolate Era], I’m going to
completely relax and empty my mind for a time, then prepare for a new
book. I’ll give myself two months of rest, then officially start
the next book on June 15<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">th</FONT></SUP>!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whew.
Wow. Yikes. Wooooow!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
is the third IET novel that I have worked on (with Coiling Dragon and
Desolate Era being solely translated by myself). I agree with author
IET that '2.5 years is a very long period of time'; I spent just as
much time translating DE as he did writing it, and in fact I've been
translating his novels from 2014 to 2018! That's an even longer
period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">I
want to thank each and every reader, commenter, donor, sponsor, and</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">friend</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">who
has supported this translation. Like IET, it's been a very long and
exhausting process and I'm both filled with joy that its over but
also nostalgia and a bit of reluctance to part with it. However,
'there is no party that goes on forever'; <FONT FACE="Ovo">天下没有不散的筵席</FONT>.
I've translated in sickness and in health (I was actually in the
hospital just earlier today due to a severe fever), through breakups
and through makeups, and all the other things that can happen over
the course of such a long period of time. Now, Ji Ning's story has
finally come to an end. As IET notes in his April 2015 afterword,
there is also a live-action adapation of DE coming shortly
(theoretically in the next month or so) and we'll be sure to announce
it as well! We were originally going to have a short video by IET as
well, but he couldn't quite fit it in his schedule. We'll post it as
a separate announcement later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
have been so many memories that have built up over the years, and
I've talked and interacted with so many of you that I genuinely view
you as friends and family. My keenest memory is of a 'Daolord' on
Patreon who deleted his pledge... or rather, his brother did. When
his brother deleted the pledge, he added a note: 'Thanks for
translating, but my big bro just passed away and I'm cutting his
pledges :( Thanks for understanding, he failed his Daomerge' I damn
near broke down on the spot. I hope that all of you and your loved
ones are as hale and hearty as you were when you first started
Desolate Era, and that you will continue to be so many, many years in
the future!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
what will I be doing next? Well, five years translating one specific
author is more than enough, even one that I cherish as much as IET;
for newcomers, it was my translation of Coiling Dragon which
inaugurated the launch of Wuxiaworld! In addition to maintaining the
site and handling company matters like licenses, copyright, etc.,
I'll be doing two things in specific - I'll be announcing tomorrow
the relaunch of Godsfall Chronicles working with Xiao Lai (we have
ten chapters ready!), and when I have a sufficient stockpile I'll
launch Dragon Talisman on Wuxiaworld! I said before that I viewed
Godsfall Chronicles as one of the most novel-quality webnovels out
there, and I stand by that belief. As for Dragon Talisman, it has a
very refreshingly kind-hearted main character and a world which is
steeped deep in Chinese lore and history, which I will endeavor to
make as accessible as possible. These are two spectacular novels, and
I hope to gain the same support and love as I've had from you in the
past :D.</P>
