Chapter 1 - His Waiting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning slammed onto
the ground, but he felt the area around him was so quiet. So
terrifyingly quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t hear
anything at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, his
entire body had lost all feeling. The powerful life force within his
Fiendgod-like body immediately got to work, and his divine power
quickly began to heal everything. The torn muscles and skin on his
body, and even his torn intestines and organs began to rapidly heal.
Ning’s ears could now hear again, and he gained feeling in his body
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pain. Such pain.”
Ning hurriedly looked into the distance. In that moment when he had
completely lost all feeling and lost all hearing, he had been
terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly too…too
terrifying.’ Ning stared at that distant, stooped, black-furred
monster which emanated that thick, deathly aura. “That slap’s
speed was so fast I couldn’t dodge at all. His strength in turn is
far greater than the combined strength of those nine strange giants!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
monster stood there quietly, his oily green eyes staring at Ning. He
let out a hoarse sigh, which carried an endless resignation and
disappointment. “I’ve waited for far too long, so long that I’ve
forgotten time. All you need to do is pass the three trials without
dying. You don’t need to kill me. You just need to knock me down,
to injure me. That’s all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With difficulty, Ning
climbed to his feet, the ground stained with blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Knock you down?”
Ning stared at the stooped, black-furred creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. More precisely
speaking, as long as you can injure me, can break my skin, can make
me bleed.” The black-furred creature said slowly, “I will
immediately fall down. I’ve already calculated…the last time,
when Immortal Juhua was recruiting a disciple, there were ten people
who had completed the trials and appeared before me. It was so rowdy.
There was one of them, a youth, who relied on an extremely powerful
Dao-seal to injure me. But I just took a step back instead of falling
down…if I had fallen down, there would have been no need for me to
endure these countless, lonely years. Loneliness truly is terrifying,
very terrifying…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Listening to this, Ning
held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature in front of him had actually existed in the era of Immortal
Juhua. He definitely wasn’t training the Immortal ways, because
there was no way for an ordinary Immortal to live this long. Only by
becoming a Celestial Immortal would one truly have an unlimited
lifespan, but there was no way a Celestial Immortal would be like the
person in front of him. Most likely, a single breath from a Celestial
Immortal would disintegrate Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master only said
that anyone able to injure and knock me down would be considered to
have passed this trial.” The black furred creature said slowly in
that hoarse voice. “Come. Injure me. As long as you can injure me,
I will immediately fall down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Injure you?”
Ning’s divine will once more picked up those two Darknorth swords.
His severed fingers were reattached. This black-furred monster only
watched silently, not interfering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
monster looked at Ning, then said slowly, “Come at me full force.
Everyone in the countless years who has come before me, I have given
them this same chance. As long as a person can injure me, I will
immediately fall down. Only…none of them were able to injure me.
Not one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only that one time,
when Immortal Juhua was recruiting a disciple, did that Dao-seal
injure me. Why didn’t I fall down? Just that one time. I missed
that opportunity and never had another one.” The black-furred
creature spoke very slowly. Tormented by countless years of
loneliness, he no longer wished to live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Injure him?” Ning
was frightened and shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what this
creature which had most likely lived since the Fiendgod era was
saying, only a single person had ever been able to injure him, and
that was through using a Dao-seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These people who
made it here over the years most likely also included geniuses who
had reached the level of comprehending the True Meaning of the Dao.”
Ning felt an unbearable pressure. “What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” The
black-furred creature began to walk forward, his body hunchbacked.
“Come. Wound me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clenched his
Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly charge
into the air, two Dao-seals appearing in his hands. They were a Light
Body Seal and a Divine Movement Seal…although he had found many
Dao-seals in the storage magic treasures on the corpses, virtually
all of them had lost their magic power over the passage of countless
years and become useless. Only a hundred or so seals were left,
amongst which the Divine Movement Seal and the Light Body Seal were
the most common. The two Dao-seals immediately entered his body upon
activation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning charged
upwards, reaching the ceiling of the corridor, then kicked off with
his two legs, utilizing the Windwing Evasion as he charged down from
the top of the prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ning
had reached the limits of his speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire
strength was focused on the Darknorth sword in his right hand,
stabbing directly downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stooped frame of
the black-furred creature came to a halt, raising its head and
staring upwards with its oily green eyes at the downwards charging
Ning. He just watched, watched quietly…his eyes didn’t have a
hint of life, seeming very slow and numb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pierces Rocks!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning charged downward,
the tip of his sword transforming into a drop of water. ‘Drip’.
It dripped onto the fur-covered face of that black-furred creature.
At this moment, both his divine power as well as his Xiantian ki were
being released at full power, and penetrative force from his high
speed combined with the ‘True Meaning of the Raindrop’ had formed
an extremely terrifying sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tip of the sword
pierced onto the black-furred creature’s face, who simply continued
to look at Ning with an upraised face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are still very
far off.” The black-furred creature sighed, his oily green eyes
filled with boundless disappointment. “I need to keep waiting, keep
waiting…as for you, I have no choice but to kill you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword had
stabbed onto the black-furred creature’s face, but hadn’t left
behind any injury. Unwilling to accept this, the Darknorth sword in
his twin hands executed the ‘Rain Line’ and ‘Moth Flies Into
the Flame’, two great killing strokes, stabbing at the creature’s
chest and face, but once again, he was unable to harm the creature at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.” Ning
hurriedly retreated dozens of meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature’s stooped form continued to make its way forward, slowly
shuffling, but moving dozens of meters with each step. In terms of
speed, he was actually even faster than Ning! Whether it was walking
speed or attack speed, he was faster than Ning. This was the first
time Ning encountered someone faster than him in this corridor of
trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he was able
to rely on his Windwing Evasion to flee and buy time for himself, but
this time, he was not able to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can his skin be
as tough as this?” Ning was incomparably frantic. Although the
other Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level who had previously
fallen here served as proof that harming this black-furred creature
was an incomparably difficult task, Ning still felt a sense of
hopelessness after he himself truly used a full force attack and yet
was unable to scratch the other’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die. Stop
struggling.” The hoarse voice rang out, and the stooped
black-furred figure appeared out of nowhere by Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body
immediately became surrounded by three fire lotus petals and three
water lotus petals, swiveling slowly in opposite directions and
generating a stirring force. But to this black-furred creature, the
force generated by the Waterflame Lotus was like nothing more than
walking within small rippling waves, unable to budge his body at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two hands once
more executed the ‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’ attack, stabbing at
the black-furred creatures legs and genitalia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m unable to
flee, and defense is useless. I have to find a chance of survival.
Killkillkill! Perhaps the other parts of his body have a weak point
that I can stab.” Ning definitely wouldn’t just give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop struggling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature sighed, and his fan-shaped giant palm once more slapped down
towards Ning. He couldn’t be bothered to take about Ning’s
swords, allowing them to stab on his body as he still slammed his
palm down on Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armor-type magic
treasure Ning was wearing instantly split apart, and the giant palm,
filled with that dense deathly aura, went straight through Ning’s
chest, and then Ning himself was sent flying far, far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lay there on the
floor, a huge hole in his chest. His body had nearly been torn in
half. Ning lay there, completely unable to move. Such a huge hole
suddenly appearing in his chest had caused his entire body to be
paralyzed. He had to wait for the life force in his body to begin to
regenerate it, but that needed time. He would most likely need half a
minute before he would be able to recover his ability to move again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But that distant,
black-furred creature was already walking over again. Most likely, in
just another second, he would be in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The stooped
figure of that black-furred creature ambled forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Ning’s
heart was filled with incomparable ardor, ardor for life. He had died
before, and had even gone to the Netherworld Kingdom and had seen
Grandma Meng’s Elixir. So he all the more desired life…he didn’t
want to go drink Grandma Meng’s Elixir. “What should I do? How
can I survive? I can’t even move…right now, all I have left is my
divine will. Can it be that I can rely on my divine will to wrap up
the Darknorth swords to pierce into the black-furred creature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt hopeless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well the
level of strength the divine will was capable of. When he had killed
Ironwood Zhan, he had investigated. Divine will was capable of
wrapping up trees, boulders, with a force that was roughly equivalent
to a late-stage Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner! The power of will
made physical was very powerful and very strong. But what good would
it be right now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also have them.”
Ning, seeing the black-furred creature draw closer, suddenly thought
of something, letting out a heroic cry. “All out, now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around
Ning, one magic treasure after another appeared out of nowhere in a
dense cluster. Sabers, swords, spears…thousands of magic treasures
hovered there. These magic treasures were all controlled by his
divine will, and the blade tips, sword tips, and spear tips were all
pointed towards that black-furred creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of my Xiantian
Ki! Let’s go!” Ning had gone completely mad. The Xiantian ki in
his dantian fully entered every single magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all unranked
magic treasures that had been left behind by deceased Xiantian
lifeforms over the course of countless years. Ning had been able to
easily bind them. All of these were usable by Xiantian experts, but
generally speaking, Xiantian experts would wield them with their
hands. Ning, because he had divine will, was able to use his divine
will to wield the magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though
thousands of hands had suddenly snatched up every single magic
treasure, aiming them at the black-furred creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of his Xiantian ki
had entered every single magic treasure, causing Ning’s meridians
to be torn. Generally speaking, a Xiantian lifeform could battle for
a very long time, but Ning had used all of his Xiantian ki to be
dispersed amongst thousands of magic treasures, causing the amount to
drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s badly damaged,
completely immobile body lay there as he howled heroically with a
savage look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heroic howl was
filled with incomparable ardor for life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Countless sword flashes, saber flashes, spear
flashes, and more all shot out, instantly turning the entire corridor
into a wall of dazzling white color. All of them were aimed with
incomparable accuracy, stabbing out at the same time at the body of
the black-furred creature, who had already closed his eyes and spread
his arms out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang….”

Chapter 2 - The Fifth Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of magic
treasures shot out like rays of sword light, blade light, spear
light, and more. They were like thousands of Xiantian Ki Refiners
attacking in unison! But Ji Ning did this all by himself. If Ning
hadn’t reached the ‘divine will’ level of the soul, there would
have been no way for him to control so many magic treasures so
accurately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning hadn’t gained
such astonishing regenerative abilities at the Xiantian level as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, he wouldn’t have been able to so wildly have
all of his ki explode outwards; the only thing that would have
happened was that his arteries and meridians would completely
shatter, resulting in him becoming a cripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature didn’t block at all, nor did he dodge at all. He held his
arms wide and closed his eyes. He was waiting…hoping…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corridor was a
cacophony of sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature was like a mountain collapsing. With a rumbling sound, he
fell over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did I wound him?”
Ning stared with incomparable hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, his body was
ravaged, his meridians and arteries were ripped, and not a single
drop of his Xiantian ki was remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must have…I must
have…” Ning stared hopefully. From afar, the fallen black-furred
creature suddenly sat up, lowering his head to look at his chest. At
his chest, his black fur had been torn apart, revealing faintly red
flesh and deep green-colored blood. A thin line of blood oozed out
from the wound, and then the wound rapidly healed, leaving behind
only that line of deep green blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
turned round, and he stared at the traces of deep green blood on the
chest of that black-furred creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Success!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had succeeded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would live!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother. I’ve
survived.” Ning’s Fiendgod-like body was quickly recovering.
Although he was unable to move, Ning forgot his pain; rather, he felt
wild joy at having overcome that tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wounded me. You
wounded me.” From afar, the black-furred creature was first
stunned, and then he raised his head, letting out a wild, heroic
howl. “Aoooooooooooooooooo!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This heroic howl
contained incomparable madness, sadness, and a sense of release.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning managed to sit up
as well now, and he stared at the distant, howling black-furred
creature….the loneliness and torment which could be heard in this
great howl, which had been suppressed for trillions of years, caused
even Ning’s heart to feel a sour bitterness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long time, the
sound ceased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-furred
creature stood up and look at Ning. In his hoarse voice, he said,
“Thank you, my new master! Hurry up and bind this Immortal mansion.
We will meet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards,
the black-furred creature disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly was able
to stand up as well. The previous wounds to his meridians had been
completely healed now, and he collected the thousands of magic
treasures that lay scattered on the floor, storing them into his
storage treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that in the end, I would rely on these unranked magic treasures to
pass the third trial.” Ning let out a long sigh. A Fiendgod Body
Refiner at the Xiantian level was able to use thousands of magic
treasures in a single combined strike…he had never even heard of
such a thing, so prior to this, he hadn’t even considered the
possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because this
sort of action would only be possible for a freakishly talented
person like Ning, who clearly was only a Xiantian level, and yet
whose soul was already on the level of having ‘divine will’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been
visualizing the [Nuwa Painting] since he was an infant. The [Nuwa
Painting] was one of the best visualization techniques even in the
Celestial Realm or the Netherworld Kingdom, much less in the mortal
realms… the likes of the Ji clan had never even heard of
‘visualization techniques’. In fact, Ning believed that even in
the entire vast area controlled by the Grand Xia Dynasty, the best
visualization techniques couldn’t necessarily compare to the [Nuwa
Painting].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I successfully
passed this tribulation.” Ning stared at his surroundings. He saw
the corpses and skeletons in the distance on the ground, and felt all
the more emotional. “The dead became these skeletons. The survivor,
according to what the black-furred creature said…I should be the
new master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no hurry to
advance. Instead, he sat down in the lotus position and rested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took a full day for
the Xiantian ki in his body to return to normal. Only then did Ning
rise and continue to advance. When walking through the twisting
corridors, Ning didn’t move very quickly. Instead, he carefully
inspected this ancient Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um?” Ning saw that
not far away, there was an exit, outside of which a pillar could
faintly be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve arrived?”
Ning quickly walked out of the exit, and as he did, he had to suck in
a cold breath. This was an incomparably vast palace, at least
thousands of meters high. Compared to this vast palace, the nearby
hundreds of meters tall corridors appeared to be extremely small.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the front of the
palace, there was an enormous praying mat, which was also three
hundred meters in diameter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in the back of the
palace…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also
hundreds of enormous prayer mats scattered about as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such an enormous
prayer mat?” Ning’s heart was filled with many questions. “Prayer
mats are meant to be sat on, but this three hundred meter long prayer
mat…what sort of a giant would sit atop this? And it seems that in
addition to the giant who would sit at the top of the hall, there
would also be hundreds of other giants sitting in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Immortal estate
of Immortal Juhua?” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Immortal was a
human, his body should be sized like a normal humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This doesn’t make
sense.” Ning hurriedly walked about, carefully inspecting this
palace. The entire palace was very old and plain. Aside from those
hundreds of prayer mats, there were no other decorations at all. One
plain stone pillar after another supported the palace hall, and on
each of the two sides of the palace hall were corridors, some three
hundred meters tall, others three thousand meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three of the
corridors that were three thousand meters tall, while only two of the
corridors that were three hundred meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t go in?”
Ning discovered that he wasn’t able to enter any of the corridors,
including the one he had just come from. It was as though there was
an invisible wall blocking them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The palace door!”
Ning turned to look at the imposing palace door. Outside the palace
door…there was an area completely enveloped in mist that one
couldn’t see through at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, in
this incomparably vast palace. He was as small as an ant. He then
walked over to one of the prayer mats and sat down. He himself was
only 1.7 meters in height, but he was seated on a three hundred meter
long prayer mat. Ning felt that this was quite amusing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is
comfortable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While sitting on the
prayer mat, Ning could feel his mind growing more alert, and even his
thoughts became much more rapid and nimble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strange. I
clearly have made it past the three trials and arrived at this palace
hall. But right now, I’m not able to enter any of the corridors of
the palace halls. I’m trapped here.” Ning said to himself. “The
original master of this Aquatic Manor, having left behind those three
trials, should have made some preparations for the successor who
passed those trials, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
black-furred creature was teleported to him, then teleported away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself had been
teleported here as well…clearly, someone should be controlling this
Aquatic Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
as Ning was sitting on the prayer mat and pondering, suddenly, from
one of the three thousand meter tall corridors off to the side of the
palace hall, an old black bull walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As though sensing it,
Ning turned his head to look. As he did, he saw an old black bull
that was many meters in length slowly walk in. The old bull’s eyes
were filled with curiosity and liveliness as it carefully inspected
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, might I ask
who you are?” Ning immediately spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely every
single creature which appeared within this Aquatic Manor was
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me?” The old black
bull shook its head. “Don’t call me ‘Senior’. I’m nothing
more than the spirit of a magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spirit of a magic
treasure?” Ning was astonished. “Magic treasures have spirits?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He’d never heard of
such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the magic
treasure which Immortal Juhua always kept by his side.” The old
black bull sighed. “Child, don’t think too much about it. Even if
I brought my ‘body’ in front of you, given your power, there is
no way you would be able to bind me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood this. As a Xiantian, he was only capable of binding some
unranked magic treasures. Even ranked treasures had high and low
level ones. The more powerful the magic treasure, the more difficult
binding it was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask about
the status of the master of this Immortal estate?” Ning hurriedly
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead. All dead.”
The old black bull shook its head. “Dead for I don’t even know
how many years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded to himself.
It was as he had thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been too
long, far too long. Over these slow, countless ages, I’ve
teleported in quite a few Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiners, as
well as Zifu Disciples.” The old black bull sighed. “Unfortunately,
not a single one was able to succeed. At most, they would make it to
the third trial, where they would all die. I didn’t expect that
you, child, who clearly don’t have sufficiently dense divine power,
would be able to succeed. This can be considered a miracle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That third trial in
particular.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your soul has
actually reached such a stage of power. However, the technique which
you used is completely impractical.” The old black bull said
disdainfully. “Thousands of magic treasures, aimed in a single
direction. All the enemy has to do is dodge, and then you would have
to immediately control thousands of magic treasures to change
direction and aim at him again…it will be very hard for you to
actually strike your enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “True.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, that golem
was driven to nearly the point of insanity by the torment of
countless years of loneliness, and so he actively welcomed the
attack.” The old black bull said. “And so, you succeeded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golem?” Ning said
in surprise. “It was a golem?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had seen golems
before. When he had been training with a sword, his father had
procured a training golem for him. But that black-furred creature
just now…it had blood, had flesh, and was even capable of speech.
How could it be a golem?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child, how much do
you know? There are many different types of golems. That one just now
was just a golem which had a soul inserted into it.” The old black
bull said. “After implanting a soul into it, it gains intelligence
and is even capable of displaying the ‘one with the world’ sage,
or even more profound sword techniques, saber techniques, boxing
techniques, etc. Naturally, its power would multiply manifold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As the soul trapped
within the golem who is forever incapable of being reincarnated, it
will be endlessly tormented.” The old black bull said. “However,
your own level of enlightenment is not low. That lotus flower you
created earlier was based on the fact that your body has the Divine
Solar Tattoo and the Divine Lunar Tattoo. For you to have these two
great divine tattoos means that you most likely are training in the
most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining technique of the Fiendgod era,
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Given your density
of divine power, I expect you have only reached the fourth stage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly said,
“Senior, your judgment is wise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is a very powerful technique.” The old
black bull sighed. “You were able to break through to the Xiantian
level, but you are only at the fourth stage. Most likely, you broke
through just recently. You should be only ten or so years old as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eleven.” Ning
didn’t try to hide it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An eleven year old
Xiantian who trains in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]. And at such a young age, you were able to reach the ‘True
Meaning of the Dao’ in swordplay.” The old black bull shook its
head. “A genius like this is someone whom even the Grand Xia
Dynasty would expend countless efforts in cultivating and training.
There’s no way they would be willing to let someone like you take
tutelage under the auspices of Immortal Juhua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lifted an
eyebrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, just by
reaching the sixth stage, given the amount of divine power you would
have, and your understanding of the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’,
you would have been able to succeed in the third trial. However, for
you to succeed in the way you have is still quite impressive. Your
soul is powerful, and your level of enlightenment is high. Your
future accomplishments will be limitless.” The old black bull
sighed. “I still have to congratulate you. You have become the
fifth master of this place.”

Chapter 3 - To Make a Copy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth master?”
Ji Ning was astonished. “Me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull had
a hint of laughter in his eyes. He slowly ambled over, his body
seeming vaguely illusory. He wasn’t a material creature, after all;
just the spirit of a magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course it is
you.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not what I
meant. What I meant was…I’m only the fifth master?” Ning
hurriedly asked. “Can it be that Immortal Juhua wasn’t the first
one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had previously
discovered the letter on that Godbanian tree bark, and had
hypothesized that after Immortal Juhua died, he shouldn’t have
given this Immortal estate to anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua was
the third master of this Immortal estate.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was the fourth?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull’s
eyes held a hint of wistful memory in them. He slowly said, “In
those days, Immortal Juhua’s fame was widespread. He was someone
who stood at the very forefront of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. A
Loose Immortal capable of living for millions of years is an absolute
miracle. The Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations which everyone who
embarks on the Immortal path must endure…each tribulation is
fiercer than the last. He had lived for simply too long, and the
difficulty of the tribulations had reached an inconceivable level.
Even Celestial Immortals probably wouldn’t be able to survive them.
The longer he lived, the more the people in the Grand Xia Dynasty
became aware of how formidable he was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua knew
that his time was limited, and so he wanted to accept a disciple, and
thus he spread the word…that he would only accept a Fiendgod Body
Refiner who was at least a Xiantian lifeform but no more than a Zifu
Disciple. Of the major clans of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the ones who
were in the know all sent their disciples to attempt the trials of
that corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two corridors. One
for Xiantian lifeforms, one for Zifu Disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One young person
after another died. In the end, finally, a Zifu Disciple named
‘Rampart’ successfully passed the three trials of his corridor,
and thus Rampart became the fourth master of this Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua was the
third.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rampart was the fourth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately.”
The old black bull shook his head. “In the face of the endless
tribulations, Immortal Juhua died. Not long after Immortal Juhua
died…Rampart, who was merely at the ‘Wanxiang Adept’ level died
as well. As for how he died and where he died, that’s unclear. Ever
since Rampart died, this Immortal estate has not had an owner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then said
questioningly, “Rampart didn’t carry the Immortal estate with
him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Carry it with him?”
The old black bull said in a low voice. “He was unable to even
completely bind this Immortal estate. How could he have carried it
with him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He, a venerable
Wanxiang Adept, was unable to bind it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
said, “Child, don’t underestimate this Immortal estate. This
Immortal estate has an extraordinary background and history, and
binding it is extremely hard. You should know that the more powerful
a magic treasure is, the harder it is to bind it. This Immortal
estate is actually a ‘dwelling’ type magic treasure…only by
becoming a Primal will one become just barely capable of binding it
and carrying it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primal can only
just barely bind it; he wouldn’t be able to completely control this
Immortal estate, which has some secret areas within that he still
wouldn’t be able to enter. Only by becoming an Earthly Immortal or
a Loose Immortal will one truly be in control of this Immortal
estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. It
made sense. If one was able to easily bind a magic treasure which was
capable of teleporting people, that would be bizarre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child, do you now
understand how extraordinary this Immortal estate is?” The old
black bull said complacently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder, you can
address me as Ji Ning.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child Ji Ning.”
The old black bull stepped onto one of the giant prayer mats on the
ground. “Take a look at this prayer mat. The prayer mats are all
hundreds of meters wide. Have you considered why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered, then
said, “Elder, when I first arrived within this palace hall, I was
very puzzled as well. There is no need for an Immortal estate to have
such enormous prayer mats. I actually wondered…if this Immortal
estate was previously lived in by a race of giants or some other
races.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Immortal
Juhua was only a Loose Immortal, he survived for millions of years
before dying.” The old black bull sighed. “He is the only Loose
Immortal I know of who lived for so long! Why was Immortal Juhua so
powerful, and why could he last for so long before dying? It was
because of this…this Immortal estate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Immortal
estate’s age is beyond reckoning. According to the guesses of
Immortal Juhua, this should have been the dwelling of an extremely
powerful Fiendgod, which is why such enormous prayer mats, beds, and
corridors were built.” The old black bull said. “Immortal Juhua
had, when he was young, made it past three trials before becoming the
third master of this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua had
to pass three trials as well?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
said, “The three trials….was the rule set down by the first
master of this Immortal estate! That first master should have been an
extremely powerful Fiendgod. Judging from the way the giant prayer
mats in this hall are laid out, that Fiendgod should have been sat on
the one up front, expounding on the Dao, while below many other
Fiendgods would listen. Haha, these are all the affairs of the past.
The Fiendgod Era ended long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull and
Ning chatted for quite a long while.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally couldn’t
help but ask, “As the fifth master of this Immortal estate, what
sort of benefits do I get?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Juhua was a
Loose Immortal who had lived for millions of years. He should have
left some things behind.” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
remained silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas!” The old
black bull finally let out a sigh. “The third master and the fourth
master both died, and they died too long ago. Immortal Juhua had
originally given Rampart some treasures, but Rampart died outside.
Countless years have passed, and you can’t possibly get anything
from Rampart. Immortal Juhua did indeed leave some magic treasures
within this Immortal estate, but you won’t be able to get them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why not?” Ning
asked. “Aren’t I the master of this Immortal estate now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
shook his head. “Imagine that you are the owner of a storage-type
magic treasure, but you aren’t able to bind it. Will you be able to
take out the treasures within it? This Immortal estate is a
dwelling-type magic treasure. If you don’t bind it, there are many
areas you cannot enter. Right now, you are only able to be here in
the main palace hall. The other areas are off limits to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can only enter
this main hall?” Ning was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should have
discovered that you are only able to be in this main hall and that
you are unable to enter the other areas of this Immortal estate.”
The old black bull said. “First become a Zifu Disciple; that will
allow you to bind the control talisman. When you bind the control
talisman, there will be many benefits to you. You will be able to
enter many of the areas within the Immortal estate, and you’ll also
be able to voluntarily enter the Immortal estate from outside; for
example, at Serpentwing Lake, you’ll be able to enter the Immortal
estate as you please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pa!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Out of nowhere, a dark
gray talisman appeared, landing on the floor with a clattering sound
atop a prayer mat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the control
talisman.” The old black bull said. “Only the master is permitted
to have the control talisman. Hurry up and take it. Once you reach
the Zifu Disciple level, you’ll be able to bind it. After binding
it, come back to the Immortal estate. Right now, you aren’t able to
enter any place at all, and you won’t be able to get anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning collected this
talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The talisman was very
rough. Atop it, there was a complicated, ancient-looking character;
‘Left’! Just a single character. Although Ning had never learned
the meaning of this character, upon seeing it, he naturally
understood what it meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Control talisman?”
Ning stored it into his storage-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You’ve
taken the control talisman, and I’ve told you everything. You can
leave now.” The old black bull said. “I’ll send you off now and
teleport you back to that island in Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly called
out, “Stop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
looked towards Ning. “Is there something else?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just like that…I’m
supposed to leave?” Ning couldn’t help but say. “I just barely
survived, and I’m supposed to leave with just a control talisman?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
blinked twice. “Whose fault is it that the previous owner has
already died? If he was alive, he could probably guide you or help
you. But I’m just the spirit of a magic treasure…I don’t have
any magic treasures or curios of my own. As for you yourself, you
train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number
one Fiendgod Body Refining technique which was even better than the
technique which Immortal Juhua trained it. What can I give you? Oh!
You probably don’t have any visualization techniques, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“visualization
techniques?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
had given him the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“visualization
techniques are capable of refining the soul and strengthening it.”
The old black bull said hurriedly. “This is something only the most
powerful of clans have access to. I have a visualization technique in
my memory. I’ll transmit it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transmit?” Ning
was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take out a quill and
some ink.” The old black bull urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flipping his hand, Ning
took out a quill and some ink, as well as a large piece of beast
skin, placing them to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
looked at the quill, which began to hover in the air. “I am the
spirit of a magic treasure who has trained for countless years, but
my ‘divine will’ is most likely still weaker than yours. Still,
grabbing a quill isn’t too difficult.” Controlling the quill, he
began to draw a painting onto that glossy beast skin parchment. Soon,
a picture of a Buddha that had a compassionate look on his face began
to appear on the parchment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Buddha had the sun
and the moon behind his back, and radiated boundless light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just by looking at it,
Ning felt slightly affected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
The old black bull casually controlled the quill and tossed it to one
side, then said delightedly, “This is a painting of the true form
of Buddha, and the Shining Sun Moon Buddha at that! This [Inner
Visualization of the Shining Sun-Moon Buddha] is the visualization
technique which Immortal Juhua had previously used. I always was by
his side, looking at this painting of Buddha, and thus I naturally
memorized it. Although my painting isn’t as good as the original,
as long as you often look at this painting of Buddha…you will
definitely strengthen your soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
“Inner visualization of Buddha?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To become a master
of the Great Dao, aside from your body, you must understand the
myriad mysteries of the Great Dao.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only felt
resigned. Compared with the [Nuwa Painting]…it wasn’t even
comparable. His [Nuwa Painting] had been imprinted by the Lord of Cui
Palace into his very soul and his memory. Naturally, he could sense
it much more clearly. This old bull had simply drawn out an image of
Buddha based on his own memory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that you
already have a visualization technique?” The old black bull noticed
that Ning wasn’t very excited, and he couldn’t help but nod.
“Makes sense. Your soul is so powerful. You should already have a
visualization technique. Right…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
pondered for a while.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just waited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This old bull was the
spirit of an extremely powerful magic treasure who had followed
Immortal Juhua for countless years. He should know many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I remember now.
Before this, you controlled thousands of magic treasures, right? I
have a secret sword formation technique that is suitable for you to
learn.” The old black bull suddenly said hurriedly. “In the past,
I watched Immortal Juhua kill a powerful enemy who controlled a large
number of flying swords in a formation to attack his enemies. His
sword formation was thus recorded down by Immortal Juhua, who
carefully looked through it. Although I only saw it once, I
completely memorized it. I’ll make a copy for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly took out
a large number of beastskin parchments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull once
again controlled the quill and began to write with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very top of the
beastskin parchment were four words: [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Lesser_Thousand_Swor"></A>
Chapter 4 - Lesser Thousand Swords Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning watched off to
the side, not daring to disturb the old black bull as he wrote. On
the skin parchment, one line of words after another swiftly appeared,
along with the occasional formation diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the pages of skin
parchment were completely filled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
tossed the quill aside, saying delightedly, “Child Ji Ning, you can
be considered to be exceptionally talented. A Xiantian who actually
has such an astonishing soul! Only with a sufficiently powerful soul
is one suited for utilizing this ‘Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation’. However, the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] also
requires flying sword type magic treasures, and it has exceptionally
high requirements with regards to the amount of magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have plenty of
these unranked magic treasures.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
shook his head. “Once you reach the Zifu Disciple level, those
unranked magic treasures will no longer be usable. At that time, what
you will need is ranked magic treasures, and generally speaking, you
will need a large number of flying sword type magic treasures in
order to utilize this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] technique’s
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A large number of
ranked magic treasures?” Ning was stunned. “How many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] at this highest level requires 729 flying swords.”
The old black bull said. “Even if you are just using the weakest
types of ranked magic treasures, you still need 729 of them…the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] requirements regarding magic
treasures are very high. The more flying swords, the better. The more
you have, the greater the power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over seven hundred
ranked magic treasures, and all sword type? He wasn’t sure if the
entire Five Prefectures of the Ji clan combined would be able to buy
so many, even if they sold off all their assets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As your power
increases, the number of flying swords you can use will naturally
increase.” The old black bull said. “Starting from Mortal-level
magic treasures to Earth-level magic treasures, to Heaven-level magic
treasures, to Immortal-level magic treasures…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I…” Ning felt
an unbearable pressure. He hurriedly said, “It wouldn’t have been
hard for Immortal Juhua to procure and leave behind a few hundred
flying swords here in this Immortal estate prior to his death, right?
And Immortal Juhua killed that powerful enemy, who used the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
shook his head. “That great enemy was known as the Thousand Swords
Immortal! Immortal Juhua had to expend enormous amounts of effort in
order to kill him. Although he had acquired those flying sword magic
treasures after killing him, it was a waste to just keep them without
using them. Thus, Immortal Juhua immediately traded them away for a
large number of precious materials, which he then forged me out of!
Thus, if you want to acquire thousands of flying swords from Immortal
Juhua, it is impossible. Truly powerful Immortals will usually only
carry a few magic treasures which they are particularly skilled in.
After killing an enemy, they will immediately use the enemy’s tools
to upgrade their own magic treasures! They won’t just leave them
there to be wasted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
was somewhat despondent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t think too
much of it. Don’t think that just because you received this
Immortal estate that you’ll instantly fly to the heavens.” The
old black bull said. “There are countless relic sites left from the
Fiendgod Era, but how many people are able to truly stand at the very
top of the Grand Xia Dynasty? The fourth master, Rampart, only
reached the Wanxiang Adept level before dying. Don’t end up like
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
continued, “My creation was thanks to this Thousand Swords
Immortal. Thus, I paid especial attention to this [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]. I didn’t just read it once; I also carefully
pondered it. I’ll explain to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to listen attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] uses nine flying sword type magic treasures to form
the base of a formation! You need nine formation bases…in order to
form a sword formation. This is the most basic sword formation, which
requires eighty one flying sword type magic treasures . This is the
first level [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are able to
control a second set of eighty one flying swords and have these two
sword formations cooperate…your power will instantly multiple! This
is the second level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! You
will need 162 flying swords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are able to
control 243 flying swords to have three sword formations join forces,
your power will multiple once more. This is the third level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four sword
formations will again multiply the power, and is known as the fourth
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so on and so
forth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, with
nine sword formations combined, you will need exactly 729 flying
swords, which will be the ninth level of this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. The power is so great…as to be inconceivable! But of
course, given your current soul strength, even if you are able to
control many unranked flying swords, you are far from being able to
reach this level for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as though
understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example, if you
were to become a Wanxiang Adept, you would be able to use unranked
magic treasures to set up nine sword formations! But if you were to
use ranked magic treasures, most likely you wouldn’t even be able
to set up two or three sword formations.” The old black bull said,
“The more powerful a magic treasure is, the more mental energy you
use up in controlling them. Naturally, it won’t be easy to control
them. But this also means that even after becoming a Celestial
Immortal, you can still use this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
However, by then, perhaps you would have acquired an even better
sword formation. But of course, this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]…should be good enough for you to use for a thousand
years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most important
secret of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] lies in the ‘Lesser
Thousand Seal Lines’…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
continued to explain some of the mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later, Ning had
finished reading the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] for the first
time. He couldn’t help but sigh in astonishment. Compared to the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], that ‘Yin-Yang Twin Energy
Formation’ which Ironwood Zhan had used was absolute trash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately and
quickly withdrew nine sword-shaped magic treasures from his storage
treasure. Because these were all unranked magic treasures, generally
speaking they were meant to be held in the hand when engaging in
battle; there were thus some differences between them and flying
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser Thousand Seal
Lines.” Ning tested drawing the lines out on the floor with his
finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning’s control
of his body, he was naturally able to completely duplicate the seal
lines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull, by
his side, shook his head. “No. It isn’t the appearance that needs
to be the same; the inner meaning needs to be the same. When you draw
the ‘Lesser Thousand Seal Lines’, you need to faintly activate
the power of the heavens and the earth. Only then will the seal lines
be complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
continued to draw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because his copying
ability was quite accurate, and given that Ning had already reached
the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’ level, and also had a faint hint of
understanding regarding the ‘Dao’…after drawing it 312 times,
he drew a seal line which was capable of utilizing a hint of the
power of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The old
black bull nodded. “Your level of comprehension is very high, your
soul is powerful, and you are very sensitive towards the heavens and
the earth. It is only normal that you learn quickly…remember, the
Lesser Thousand Seal Lines is the base for the entire [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]. You must not reveal it. Once the Lesser
Thousand Seal Lines are revealed, some of the larger tribes will
definitely be able to develop this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
just based on the seal lines.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then you can begin.”
The old black bull watched from one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let himself calm
down, and then he withdrew a small basin from within his storage
treasure. He placed his finger within the small basin, and from
within his fingernail, one drop of blood after another began to well
up and flow out. Soon, he had a small basin that was half-full of
blood. Watching to the side, the old black bull shook his head and
sighed emotionally, “Fiendgod Body Refiners have extremely powerful
life force. They can be chopped into many pieces without dying, while
Ki Refiners will die to a blow to the heart. If a Ki Refiner was to
lose this much blood, their face would turn pale. For you, though,
most likely your body replenished the blood as soon as you let it
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say
anything. Instead, he picked up a sword-type magic treasure, which
suddenly shrank in size greatly. Ning’s finger, stained with blood,
began to draw atop the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
a single Lesser Thousand Seal Line appeared on the sword. A bloody
light flashed, and quickly, the seal line completely merged into the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” The old
black bull nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then picked up yet
another sword-type treasure. Once he had mastered the Lesser Thousand
Seal Lines, he virtually never made a mistake. During this attempt at
the trials, he had acquired thousands of magic treasures, with swords
being extremely common. He had a full thousand sword-type magic
treasures. Ning straightforwardly drew onto 729 of the sword-type
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation base!”
Ning sat there in the lotus position, and imposed his will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, nine
swords swung into the air around Ning, slowly revolving. But there
was something missing. Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. The power
of the sword formation comes from attuning to the heavens and the
earth.” The old black bull said to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the amount of
time it took to brew tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine swords
hovering around Ning were faintly carrying within them a type of
invisible intent. It was as though the nine swords actually formed a
single entity. In that moment, the nine swords were positioned in a
very perfect manner with respect to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation base
is complete. Formation, arise!” Ning willed it, and then 72 more
swords suddenly lifted up, all of them in groups of nine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] required 81 swords to be formed
into a formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">81 sword-type magic
treasures circled and hovered around Ning, while Ning himself closed
his eyes as he controlled them. Soon, with the Lesser Thousand Seal
Lines in each sword as the base, the 81 sword-type magic treasures
began to emit a hazy glow while countless sword glows quickly
converged around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A constantly
fluctuating sword light hovered there in the air next to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally opened his
eyes and stared at the hovering sword light next to him. This sword
light was the Xiantian ki of his which had been transformed and
compressed by the magic formation of the 81 sword-type magic
treasures. The amount of power had already caused a qualitative
change, and the strength was astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not too bad.” Ning
willed it. Another 81 swords rose into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
stood there, watching. He couldn’t help but sigh in amazement at
the strength of Ning’s soul. This wasn’t as simple as what he had
done earlier, just stupidly and wildly controlling thousands of magic
treasures to go forward in one direction. He had to carefully control
every single flying sword…causing them to form a perfect, complete
sword formation which was continuously able to summon the power of
the heavens and the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He mastered the
third level as well. In terms of strength alone, the power of his
sword light right now isn’t any longer than his earlier attack of
thousands of magic treasures.” The old black bull sighed in
astonishment. The power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
multiplied several times over with each increase in level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundreds of sword-type
magic treasures swiveled around Ning, with the surface of each sword
having a hint of light on it. In front of Ning, the solidified,
devouring sword light grew even more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another 81 swords
entered the mix, with the level of difficulty in controlling them
quickly increased as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s forehead began
to be covered in sweat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the swords were
hovering with a faint light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” The old
black bull was stunned, incomparably stunned. “He is actually able
to utilize the fifth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Papapapapapa…405
swords clattered and fell to the floor. His forehead covered in
sweat, Ning opened his eyes and murmured to himself, “The fifth
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is too arduous. My
head hurts terribly. Normally, in battle, I should limit myself to
the fourth level. Using the fourth level is much easier.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 5 - Ancient Rites
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
looked at Ji Ning, head covered in sweat, and said in praise,
“Formidable, formidable. Child Ji Ning, at such a young age, you
are already able to utilize the fifth level of the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]. Compared to you, that Rampart is nothing worth
mentioning at all! I didn’t expect that after the Immortal estate
has waited for so many years, an unpolished jade like you would
appear!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured to
himself, ‘unpolished jade’? He himself had the experiences of his
previous life, the [Nuwa Painting], and had been training hard since
he was young. All these factors combined were what led to the old
black bull praising him as being a piece of ‘unpolished jade’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, right now, I
find it difficult to utilize the fifth level.” Ning repeatedly
shook his head. “I’m only able to use the fourth level freely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Using it freely is
more important.” The old black bull sighed. “Have you discovered
that although the fourth level of this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] only allows you to control three hundred or so flying
swords, in terms of power, it is already greater than when you wildly
controlled thousands of magic treasures!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a hint of
amazement. “Even more powerful than the combined attack of
thousands of swords from earlier? Although I was able to feel that
the sword light I created was done so in a free manner and that it
held great power, I didn’t know exactly how much power it had.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
said, “The fourth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
will allow you to kill most peak Xiantian lifeforms as easily as you
wish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was delighted upon
hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
hurriedly asked, “Dare I ask, how is my current power? How does it
compare to a Zifu Disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, you have
two primary types of battle tactics. The first relies on your
Fiendgod body and your close-combat sword techniques.” The old
black bull said. “Your swordplay already carries within it a hint
of the True Meaning of the Dao. Most Xiantian lifeforms aren’t at
such a high level of comprehension; most peak Xiantian lifeforms are
at the ‘one with the world’ stage. Just based on this alone, you
are at an advantage compared to most peak Xiantian lifeforms! But of
course, I’m just talking about ‘ordinary’ Xiantian lifeforms.
If your enemy is as much of a freak as you are, whose swordplay is
not inferior to you, then it would be hard to say who would win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood. For
example, his father, Ji Yichuan. His swordplay was most likely still
inferior to that of his father; after all, Father had long ago
reached the peak Xiantian level. Ning naturally wouldn’t be a match
for his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you relied on
your [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]…” The old black bull
continued, “Given your powerful Fiendgod body, if you use hundreds
of flying swords to form into a [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation],
the power will indeed be very formidable. In terms of strength, it
will be far beyond that of peak Xiantian lifeforms. It should have
reached the power level of most early Zifu Disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just early Zifu?”
Ning felt that his improvement should be larger than this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
shook his head. “Don’t underestimate Zifu Disciples. Once Zifu
Disciples internally establish their Zifu, the ‘Violet Palace’,
their bodies will begin to generate elemental power! Even simple
attacks such as punches and kicks will be far greater than that of
the Xiantian level. These are two fundamentally different levels! In
addition, more importantly, Zifu Disciples are capable of using
ranked magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ranked magic
treasures are extremely powerful. Zifu Disciples, when using them,
are far more powerful than you Xiantians can imagine. The difference
between a peak Xiantian and a Zifu Disciple is like that of an infant
and an adult.” The old black bull sighed in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. From the
Xiantian level to the Zifu level was a fundamental change. It allowed
one to be able to use ranked magic treasures. It was much like how a
Xiantian lifeform could kill a peak Houtian expert as easily as
chopping vegetables. Zifu Disciples could kill Xiantian lifeforms
just as easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember.” The old
black bull shook his head. “No matter what, do not underestimate
Zifu Disciples. Every single Zifu Disciple has bizarre, strange
abilities. Some are skilled at formations, others are skilled at
venomous pests, still others at controlling souls or creating golems,
or even sorcery…there’s no way to describe them in ‘general’.
If you run into someone who is a bad matchup for you, you will
definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The weak can
overcome the strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If a bad matchup
happens, an early Zifu expert can slay a late Zifu expert.” The old
black bull sighed. “The path of Immortality includes everything in
existence. There are too many techniques…a Zifu Disciple might be
weak, but if he had raised millions of terrifying venomous insects,
even a Wanxiang Adept might be devoured alive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swallowed a cold
breath of air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it’s rare.”
The old black bull said hurriedly. “It’s quite rare for someone
of a lower rank to kill someone of a higher rank. For example,
someone like you who has such an incredibly powerful soul as well as
hundreds of flying swords, and the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]…many factors combined to give you this sort of combat
potential. I’m just warning you not to underestimate any opponent.
Even Xiantian lifeforms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the Zifu
Disciple level in particular, no one was easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, Ning was
still quite joyful. On this trip to the underground estate, he had
acquired a killing attack; the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child Ji Ning.”
The old black bull continued, “Before this, when I watched you
attempt the trials, I discovered that the power of your swords is
fairly average. Can it be that you aren’t aware of the ‘Fiendgod
Bloodforging’ technique?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgod
Bloodforging technique?” Ning blinked. “What’s that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
couldn’t help but say, “In the Fiendgod Era, virtually all people
with a bit of power or clans of a decent size would know about this.
This is because every single Fiendgod knew it, and this was something
which every single Fiendgod had to learn. I saw that you are clearly
a Fiendgod Body Refiner, but you it seemed as though you didn’t
know the Bloodforging technique. Naturally, that made me curious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please
instruct me.” Ning asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having an old person at
home was like having a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of old man
who had lived since the Fiendgod era knew so many things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgods are not
the same as we humans.” The old black bull said. “They don’t
train in Ki, and are unable to use magic treasures. However, they
need weapons as well. As their strength increased in power, however,
how could they find a suitable weapon for them? Thus…the great
powers amongst the Fiendgods developed the Fiendgod Bloodforging
technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, find a
weapon, and then utilize the complicated Rites of Bloodforging! After
the bloodforging is completed the weapon will be able to absorb
various auras, such as a baleful aura, an evil aura, a killing aura,
and other auras. The more enemies you kill, the more powerful the
enemies you kill, the more the weapon will naturally strengthen. It
can change in size and weight as you please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sort of weapon
is often referred to as a ‘divine weapon’, a ‘demonic weapon’,
or a ‘slaying weapon’.” The old black bull said. “As the
strength of the master increases, and as the master kills more and
more powerful opponents, the strength of the weapon will increase as
well, to the point where in the Fiendgod era, some divine weapons and
demonic weapons were even more powerful than Immortal-level magic
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
shining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. The heavens were
always fair. The Fiendgods were completely unable to use magic
weapons, but thus they had some techniques to make weapons for
themselves. So it was through absorbing baleful auras and other
auras; causing their divine weapons to increase in power through
slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please teach
me.” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since I’ve
mentioned this to you, of course I will teach you.” The old black
bull said. “The Rites of Bloodforging are very complicated. Listen
carefully.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
stood there, expounding on the process of the Rites of Bloodforging,
while at the same time drawing down some diagrams on occasion. Ning
just listened and memorized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it known as the
Rites of Bloodforging?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primary required
ingredient was the blood of Fiendgods. For a human Fiendgod Body
Refiner, only the blood of one who had naturally developed divine
tattoos while reaching the Xiantian level would suffice, as only then
would they have been reborn into the body of a Fiendgod. Only such a
person would be able to use the Fiendgod Bloodforging technique. Some
of the lower-class Fiendgod Body Refiners were unable to use this
bloodforging technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” Ning
took out a gourd. This gourd was originally used to store wine. It
didn’t look large, but it was able to contain ten thousand
kilograms of wine. Ning poured out all of the remaining wine in the
gourd, not leaving a single drop behind, and then placed his finger
into the gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood dripped out from
his finger, flowing into the gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A thousand kilograms
of blood is enough.” The old black bull said to the side. “This
bloodforging technique is only usable by Fiendgods. Normal Ki
Refiners who lose this much blood will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position. Immediately after having released the blood, the
powerful life force in his body naturally began to regenerate his
blood. The only thing which was used up was divine power. When the
divine power in Ning’s body was reduced to just half, roughly a
thousand kilograms of blood had entered the gourd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are seven
steps to the rites. You must be sincere.” The old black bull
warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning respectfully knelt
down and kowtowed three times, and then stood up before kneeling down
and kowtowing three more times. He did this eight times, in all eight
directions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…” Ning
suddenly overturned the gourd in his hand. From within the gourd
flowed out a large amount of fresh blood. As soon as it flowed out,
it was wrapped up by Ning’s divine will and quickly scattered in an
area of roughly two hundred and fifty meters around him. The
countless droplets of blood formed into a massive diagram, a diagram
of a head with disheveled hair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The diagram completed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Instantly, a
bloody aura that was visible to the naked eye began to shine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The descendant
kneels in supplication to the Ancestor God.” Ning called out in a
loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first step of the
bloodforging rites - Begging the Ancestor God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The complicated Rites
of Bloodforging continued for nearly half a day. The bloody light in
the area had already formed into a bizarre character. According to
what the old black bull had said…this sort of character was known
as Fiendgod characters! It was a type of writing which the heavens
had naturally given birth to. Although he had never learned it
before, the first time he had seen the characters, he understood it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The meaning of this
Fiendgod character was…‘KILL’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…”
Three Darknorth swords appeared in mid-air. As soon as they appeared,
they began to hover there. The weapons which Ning was planning to use
the Rites of Bloodforging on were these Darknorth swords! Because,
according to what the old black bull had said, although the Fiendgod
Bloodforging technique didn’t have very high standards necessary
towards weapons, the better the base material was, the better the
results would be. Those unranked magic treasures were simply too
inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the judgment
of that old black bull, the Darknorth swords should have previously
been Heaven-level magic treasures. Although the runes atop them had
been destroyed, the only thing that matter for bloodforging was the
physical material components. As for the runes, those were
meaningless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!” “Hua!”
“Hua!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Kill’
character formed by the nearby blood began to shoot shadows out from
itself, entering the three swords. That enormous ‘Kill’ character
hovering in mid-air began to dim, and then disappeared. The entire
hall once more returned to its usual calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a long
breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
couldn’t help but say. “Just then, I sensed an awesome presence
that seemed even higher than that of the ‘Dao’…” He had
meditated on the Dao before, and had gained a hint of an insight into
the aura of the Dao. However, just now, when undergoing the Rites of
Bloodforging, that ancient, natural aura that had emanated forth made
him feel as though he had touched a powerful, mighty existence which
was even more ancient than the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
sighed. “I didn’t dare to say a word during the Rites of
Bloodforging. I was completely stunned. Take a look and see how your
weapon seems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a wave of his
hand, the three Darknorth swords landed in Ning’s grasp. Picking
one up with his divine will, he sliced it against his arm. Chi! The
skin on his arm, seemingly as tough as leather, began to emit sparks,
then finally cracked apart into a wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Much sharper.”
Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Darknorth
swords were made from good materials.” The old black bull said.
“Right now, your close combat abilities have increased
dramatically. Most peak Xiantian experts won’t be a match for you.
In close combat, you are only one or two levels lower in power than
when using the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. However, you must
understand that you are training in the number one Fiendgod Body
Refining technique. Your close combat strength will increase at a
monstrous rate. For example, when you train to the sixth stage, your
close combat power should completely eclipise the power of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! Once you then learn a
close-combat type ‘divine ability’, it will become effortless for
you to do battle against those at a higher level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
“Elder, do you know any divine abilities?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine abilities?
Those are the secrets of the great powers amongst Fiendgods, which
are not taught to outsiders.” The old black bull shook his head.
“Immortal Juhua only knew a single divine ability; the ‘Heavenly
Transformation’ technique. Unfortunately, I never asked him about
it. Alright…given your potential, in the future, you will
definitely have the chance to learn a ‘divine ability’. Once you
do, it will be normal for you to fight those at a higher level. That
is the power of a true Fiendgod!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood. As an
Fiendgod Body Refiner, he had a good foundation. In a few years, he
would reach the sixth stage. His [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
would also strengthen alongside his soul, and he was very talented.
The only problem was that the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had
very high requirements with regards to magic treasures. When he
became a Zifu Disciple, he would have to get hundreds of ranked magic
treasures…his head hurt just thinking about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. You can go
back now.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you so much,
Senior.” Ning naturally had packed away the scrolls of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] and the [Inner Visualization of the
Shining Sun-Moon Buddha]. Although he himself didn’t need the
visualization technique for himself, he could still leave it for his
parents or the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go.” The
old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only felt an
enormous illusory grizzly head appear, swallowing him within its maw.
Spacetime around him once more distorted. He understood that he was
about to return to Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 - Ji Ning - Entering Lake, Battling Serpentwing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning only felt
spacetime changing, and then everything calmed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning looked
at the dark tunnel in the lair. This was the place he had been
teleported from. He couldn’t help but laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This event truly had
been something he had barely survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the end, he
had lived, and his power was much greater than before as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next time I go in,
I’ll need to have first bound this control talisman.” Ning
stretched out his hand, and a roughly made talisman appeared within
it, with the Fiendgod character for ‘Right’ embedded on it. Ning
had tested binding it, but unfortunately, his Xiantian ki was
completely unable to enter it. It seemed as though he absolutely had
to wait to become a Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right?” Ning
murmured. “Why is there a ‘Right’ character on this talisman? I
wonder what sort of history it has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning pushed
it to the back of his mind as he stored the talisman again. With a
leap, he moved out from the corridor as agilely and as quickly as a
gust of wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake,
within a crude room. Ji Yichuan and his wife were living here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow was
currently quietly seated at the side of the lake. In her hand, she
held a cup of boiling hot water, which she was slowly drinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow, Snow.”
Suddenly, a cry of excitement rang out from within the room. Yuchi
Snow immediately turned her head to look. The normally glacier-like
Yichuan now had his face covered with excitement and joy as he rushed
out. On his chest, some drops of water could be seen, with the faint
scent of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow, seeing the
way her man was acting, had a sense that she knew what had happened.
“What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense it.”
Yichuan said hurriedly. “I can sense the jade sword. It is
completely unharmed! Previously, Ning definitely must have suddenly
entered a secret, hidden area, a small dimension or a small world, or
perhaps an ancient formation. He has already come out of that hidden
area alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Encountering a relic
site was a matter of luck, but it also represented an enormous risk!
Ning hadn’t left for over a month, and so the two of them had been
growing increasingly concerned and increasingly panicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow closed her
eyes. Two flows of tears came out, and she murmured to herself,
“Thank the heavens and thank the earth. Thank the heavens and thank
the earth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is currently in
the center of Serpentwing Lake, most likely on that island.”
Yichuan said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go see him.”
Snow stood up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” It had
been a long time since Yichuan had lost his composure like this. Even
when he had learned that his son had broken through to the Xiantian
level, he hadn’t been this excited. Immediately, he took his wife
by the hand and began running across the surface of the lake as
though it were solid land, transforming into a streak of blue mist as
he hurried afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Firebird
couldn’t always be here waiting. After all, that was the
spirit-beast of Ji Redflower! In recent days, Yichuan and Snow had
been living here, while the Azure Firebird had gone home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster
Serpentwing, I, Ji Ning, have come again! You still won’t come
out?!” A loud roar spread in every direction, including into the
ears of Yichuan and his wife, still walking across the surface of the
lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, he…” Yuchi
Snow couldn’t help but reveal a hint of a laugh on her face. “As
soon as he leaves that hidden relic site, he immediately once again
challenges that Serpentwing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “Ji
Ning relied on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to
become a Xiantian, and so he wasn’t that far off from Serpentwing
to begin with in power. This time, within that hidden relic site,
perhaps he had some certain gains…and now that I can sense his
location, there’s no need for any concern.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Snow
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
move forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look!” Yichuan saw
from afar, in the distance, the waves of the lake were parted as a
youngster was walking directly towards the bottom of the lake. “That
kid has actually parted the waters and is heading directly towards
the bottom of the lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s going to the
bottom of the lake?” Snow was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan shook his head.
“Don’t be worried. You watched Ning as he grew up. Can it be that
you don’t know his temperament? If he wasn’t confident, would he
go down?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Snow
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go over, but
we’ll stay on the surface of the lake.” Yichuan said. “We’ll
monitor the situation down below at all times. As soon as anything
goes wrong, I will immediately go down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster
Serpentwing, I, Ji Ning, have come again! You still won’t come
out?!” After calling out while at the surface of the lake, Ning
waited for a long time but Serpentwing still did not come out. Ning
immediately made the decision to use his power to control fire and
water to take command over the water around him in Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the lake
were parted by an invisible hand, and were parted, revealing a
corridor into the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked directly
towards the bottom of the lake. The deeper he went, the more powerful
the water pressure became. Ning directly controlled a cylindrical
underwater ‘corridor’ roughly ten meters across as he walked down
through the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the one
named Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aquatic lesser
monsters within the lake stared from afar as a human walked down
through a corridor. All of them once more went to make the report.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing’s nest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Diremonster,
Serpentwing, had already transformed into human form, and was seated
on a chair. He was forcibly suppressing his rage. “This Ji Ning
came over a month ago to challenge me, and now he is challenging me
again! The lake is so enormous. If some Xiantian lifeforms are hidden
nearby, who would know? I know you have a trap. How could I let
myself fall for it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great king, great
king.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great king.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three lesser aquatic
monsters came charging over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Serpentwing growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the three lesser
aquatic monsters, the leader, a prawn monster, hurriedly reported,
“Great king, that Ji Ning suddenly parted the waters and has begun
entering the depths of the lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entering the lake?”
Serpentwing suddenly stood up, then immediately said, “When he
parted the waters, what method did he use?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We didn’t see him
use any Xiantian Ki, nor did we see anything special. The waters
simply naturally parted.” That prawn monster said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing said in
astonishment, “No wonder this Ji Ning dared to challenge me in such
a way. So he was capable of controlling water as soon as his Fiendgod
Body Refining technique reached the Xiantian level. I wonder which
type of technique he trains it. Who cares. When I went to the Western
Prefecture City, he was only at Houtian level. Now that he has
reached the Xiantian level, he is still only at most an early
Xiantian!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually dares to
enter the lake!” The long, narrow eyes of Serpentwing were flashing
with a ferocious light. “Hell has no doors, but you insist on
barging in. I, Serpentwing, will naturally grant you your wish and
send you to the depths of the eighteenth level of Hell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing immediately
charged out of his nest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were on the
surface of the lake, Serpentwing would be afraid of an ambush. But
the bottom of the lake was his territory. Humans who entered it
wouldn’t be able to use a tenth of their power; even if Yichuan had
entered, he would only at most be able to wound Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is actually
as stupid as this? It makes sense. He’s just an eleven year old
child. His power is great, and so he thinks he is a peerless talent,
and he has no regard for anyone. You killed my boy Redtip. I will
definitely kill you.” Serpentwing, upon leaving his nest,
immediately transformed into his enormous winged serpent form,
swimming at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it really is
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing suddenly
came to a halt. Staring into the distance, he saw that from afar,
Ning was already very close to the bottom of the lake, and a
cylindrical downwards corridor was constantly being created, with a
human youth slowly walking downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really did come
to the bottom of the lake.” Serpentwing’s red eyes were filled
with a murderous light. “He really is asking for death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He quickly swam over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was wielding the
Darknorth sword in his hand, striding on the water as he walked
towards the bottom of Serpentwing Lake. Wherever he walked past, the
waters of the lake naturally parted to form a corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning
immediately saw that enormous black shadow draw close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing!” Ning
immediately recognized him. As the enormous black shadow drew near,
that ferocious head of Serpentwing’s grew clearer as well. Those
scarlet red eyes were staring angrily at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!”
Serpentwing let out a furious howl, his voice ringing out. “You
killed my son. Today, I will make you pay for it with your life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning roared back,
“Old monster, you have slaughtered humans in the thousands. You
caused the death of Spring Grass, and today, I will personally
execute you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The original cause of
so many things!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So many people had
died. Spring Grass had died. All of this came from the enmity between
himself and Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, you will
execute me? Little child, you truly don’t know your own limits. You
actually dare to come into the depths of the water…once you are
within the water, you won’t be able to return to the surface of the
lake until your next life!” Serpentwing was supremely confident.
“Your father wounded me multiple times, but I will let him share
the pain of losing a child with me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came to an end, Serpentwing suddenly scurried forward, charging
straight towards the corridor which Ning had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…” First, a
serpentine tail pierced into the watery corridor, smashing straight
towards Ning. Serpentwing’s current speed and power…was
immeasurably greater than the Azure Skysnake’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lives up to being
a peak Xiantian-level Diremonster.” Ning was startled. In terms of
speed alone, the late Xiantian-level Serpentwing was actually
somewhat weaker than the Azure Skysnake, but in strength he was
definitely above the Azure Skysnake. But now, even in terms of his
weakness, speed, Serpentwing was superior to the Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his strong
point, power, Serpentwing had reached an awe-inducing level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old monster, prepare
for death!” Ning immediately utilized his Windwing Evasion,
transforming into blurred smoke that was even faster than the
whipping attack of the serpentine tail of Serpentwing, immediately
leaping onto the body of the snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaaaaaaaar.”
Serpentwing turned his head, opening his foul maw and biting down
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, wielding his
Darknorth swords in his hands, leapt up and directly stabbed towards
Serpentwing’s serpentine head.
</P>

Chapter 7 - Painting Serpentwing Lake with Blood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing’s giant
bloody maw spat out a watery arrow of liquid. Swish! Swish! Swish!
Gleaming with black light, the venomous liquid spread out towards Ji
Ning, who didn’t dodge at all. The Darknorth sword in his left hand
immediately executed the ‘Watertight’ technique, deflecting the
venomous liquid to one side, and it landed on Serpentwing’s own
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…”
Serpentwing’s scales were immediately set alight, but then
afterwards the venomous liquid sank into Serpentwing’s body,
absorbed by him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s left hand had
pushed aside the venomous liquid. His right hand was stabbing
straight for Serpentwing’s head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword flashed like
a ray of light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword contained
the power of the True Meaning of the Waterdrop, and was so fast that
it caused even Serpentwing to be shocked. He hurriedly tried to twist
his head away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop!” Ning’s
eyes were filled with a cold, flashing light. “PIERCES ROCKS!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light flashed
straight through the side of Serpentwing’s head, piercing straight
through those scales and then burrowing straight through the side of
his head. Beneath the injury, one could faintly even see the white
skull bone, and an enormous amount of green blood sprayed out from
the wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually injured
me?” The old monster, Serpentwing, went completely berserk. He
wildly swung his head, his enormous scaled wings quickly sweeping
towards Ning as well, and even his serpentine tail struck out,
seeking to constrict Ning. For a moment it seemed as though he had
been possessed, and the waters of the lake around them began to
bubble and froth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, wielding his two
swords, moved like a shadow. “Not only will I injure you, I will
kill you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Serpentwing
was stunned at the power of the swordplay Ning had displayed, he
refused to believe that he, an old monster who had been training for
a thousand years, would be defeated by this little human child.
What’s more, Ning was the one who killed his most beloved child,
Redtip…in this moment, Serpentwing had only one thought - kill Ji
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the lake
swirled about, and the enormous scaled wings as well as that
unpredictable serpentine tail attacked wildly. The waters of the lake
was the domain of the aquatic monsters, and here, Serpentwing was
like a tiger who had been given wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the principles of
‘using generals against soldiers, using earth to block floods’,
Ning continued to use appropriate, matching techniques to deal with
the attacks. His sword techniques flashed out, leaving behind one
wound after another on the serpentine tail and scaled wings of
Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he possibly
defeat me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die! Die! Die! I
will make you die!” The old monster Serpentwing was now completely
berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
battle against him, and occasionally, with but a glance, he would
create a fire lotus petal or a water lotus petal. The fire lotus
petal and water lotus petal would appear directly above and below
Serpentwing, boxing him within. As the fire lotus petal and water
lotus petal slowly swiveled in opposite directions, Serpentwing began
to howl as his scales began to crack. “FORM!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above his head, a layer
of frost rapidly appeared, while at the same time, his serpentine
head shook violently, dispersing the Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They battled wildly
within the lake, causing utter chaos. None of the lesser aquatic
monsters dared to draw near.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing’s body
was covered with multiple gaping wounds, and green blood oozed
everywhere, staining the surrounding lake water green.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan, dressed in
white fur, stood there with Yuchi Snow. The entire surface of the
lake was shaking wildly, as though deep within the lake, an enormous
aquatic monster was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such a large
commotion.” Yichuan’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow nodded as well.
“It seems Ning is giving that old monster Serpentwing a great deal
of pressure. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be such a large commotion.
Look, the water of the lake is turning green, and there are corpses
of fishes and prawns.” The nearby undulating waters of the lake
were beginning to have corpses of fish and prawns float on the
surface. Clearly, they had been poisoned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan took a sniff
with his nose. “This is the blood of Serpentwing. His blood is
highly venomous. Even after having been diluted by the lake water,
most fish and prawns will be poisoned to death by it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has lost so much
blood.” Snow’s amusement became even more pronounced. “Ning’s
power has improved greatly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. To let a peak
Xiantian-level old monster like Serpentwing lose so much blood is
indeed very impressive.” Yichuan was very eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing had already
used all the power available to him, but he still had yet to even
injure Ning. Instead, his body was now covered with wounds, all
inflicted by the sharp Darknorth swords in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I reached the
peak Xiantian stage, in this area controlled by the Ji clan, there’s
only a few people more powerful than me! All of them are extremely
famous…how could this punk Ji Ning be so powerful? Most likely, not
even that Ji Lee is a match for him.” Serpentwing, after going
berserk for a time, had calmed down, and had begun to plan for a
retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power Ning had
displayed truly was astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As an old monster,
Serpentwing’s body was naturally powerful…the sword attacks of
most Xiantian-level Ki Refiners probably wouldn’t even break
through his scales. But Ning’s swords were incomparably sharp! They
sliced right through, leaving massive wounds, or pierced right
through, gouging great holes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In a few more years,
won’t this Ji Ning be even more powerful than his father?” The
rage in Serpentwing’s heart was quickly dissipating, leaving behind
only terror and alarm. “There’s no way I’ll be able to outfight
a freak like him. I’d best flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a shake of his
serpentine tail and a turn of his serpentine head, the two scaled
wings began to tremble…and Serpentwing began to attempt to flee at
high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old monster
Serpentwing, don’t even think about fleeing!” Ning, currently
standing on Serpentwing’s body, simultaneously controlled the
corridor of water while utilizing the Windwing Evasion technique
rapidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I want to leave,
I’ll leave.” Serpentwing bellowed. With a shake of his tail, the
waters of the lake immediately grew turbulent, and a surge of water
immediately drenched Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards,
Serpentwing felt extremely delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A corridor formed by
controlling water? Serpentwing was an aquatic monster who could also
control water. To destroy it would naturally be extremely easy. If he
wasn’t able to beat Ning, could it be that he also wouldn’t be
able to flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Serpentwing
suddenly, vaguely felt a terrifying threat appear. He couldn’t help
but to turn his head and look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the lake waters
behind him, Ning was currently standing upright and floating,
surrounded by countless sword-type magic treasures. Every single one
of them was covered with a faintly glowing light. A glowing sword of
light formed from Xiantian ki that had been passed through and
transformed by over three hundred flying sword magic treasures was
currently hovering next to Ning, flickering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures? So
many magic treasures?” Serpentwing was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The glowing sword of
light flashed, instantly traversing hundreds of meters. Serpentwing
could sense that this glowing sword of light contained boundless
power. He wanted to turn his head to dodge it, but the glowing sword
of light only curved slightly when arcing, and thus still pierced
with great precision straight through the center of Serpentwing’s
serpentine head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword of light
pierced straight through Serpentwing’s skull, carrying with it
green blood as well as some brain tissue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaah!”
Serpentwing stared at Ning in astonishment. “This formation,
formation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should feel
honored that you died beneath this sword formation.” Ning slowly
walked over, and the waters of the lake parted before him.
Serpentwing’s eyes grew dim, and then his enormous body began to
slowly drift downwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This old monster of
Serpentwing Lake, who had been treated as a local tyrant for
thousands of years, had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching the corpse of
Serpentwing slowly drift down, Ning had very complicated feelings in
his heart. It was this old monster who had gone to Western Prefecture
City to attack him…resulting in this chain of events. When he had
gone out adventuring and exploring, he had treated Serpentwing as his
ultimate goal. Although Serpentwing had broken through to the peak
Xiantian level in power, Ning had still executed him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Collect.” Ning
grabbed Serpentwing’s enormous corpse. With but a thought, he
stored it into an empty storage-type magic treasure. Although
Serpentwing’s corpse was massive, when rolled up, it could still
fit into one of the storage-type magic treasures. Although Ning
didn’t have many other things, he had nearly a thousand
storage-type magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go back up.”
With but a thought, the waters parted above him, and Ning began to
walk upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
standing atop the lake, waiting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No more movement?”
Snow looked at the slowly calming waters. “There’s nothing going
on down there any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing was most
likely unable to do anything to Ning.” Yichuan said. “Thus, he
probably retreated. This battle has come to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow looked at her man.
“Can’t it be that Ning executed that old monster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Executed? In the
water, that old monster can battle when he wants and flee when he
wants. Beating him is easy, but executing him? Hard, hard, hard.”
Yichuan had personally fought with Serpentwing a few times. He
couldn’t help but shake his head. But then his eyes lit up, and he
stared into the distance. “Look. Ji Ning is coming out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow turned to look as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar was the
island in the center of Serpentwing Lake. A white wave was rising up
next to the island, and the wave then parted, creating a corridor. A
youth dressed in beast furs was walking through the waves, heading
straight for the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning!” Snow
immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been walking
on the waves and heading for the island, but in his ears, he suddenly
heard that familiar call. “Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother?” Ning was
stunned, and he hurriedly turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, he saw Ji
Yichuan, dressed in white furs, and Yuchi Snow. They were rapidly
running towards him on water. This sight caused Ning to be both
astonished and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow landed
on the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” As soon as
she had arrived, Snow immediately grabbed her son by the hand,
carefully inspecting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. Even
if Ji Ning was wounded, given the strength of his Fiendgod body, he
will quickly recover.” Yichuan looked towards Ning, his eyes filled
with satisfaction. “To be able to battle with a peak Xiantian-level
Diremonster and cause him, Serpentwing, to flee helplessly…Ning,
you have improved even more than I predicted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled, and
then he quickly said, “Father, I executed the Diremonster,
Serpentwing.”

Chapter 8 - Ji Ning’s Gains
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You executed
Serpentwing?” Ji Yichuan looked at his son, and by his side, Yuchi
Snow stared in disbelief as well. The two of them knew that their son
wasn’t the type of person to tell lies, but this was simply
too…when the experts of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan had
battled Serpentwing numerous times, they hadn’t been able to
execute Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning said hurriedly,
“Father, please look.” With a wave of his hand, out of nowhere,
an enormous thing covered in wounds appeared in the pool next to
them. Those enormous scaled wings, that viscous green blood…they
all testified to this creature’s identity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow looked
at the enormous corpse. They couldn’t help but exchange a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems my son’s
strength…his strength is quite extraordinary.” Yichuan said. “Not
only did he kill Serpentwing, he also was able to store Serpentwing’s
corpse within storage-type magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
Ning didn’t hide anything. “When I was adventuring at Eastmount
Marsh, I encountered the Ironwood clan’s Ironwood Zhan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was a dangerous
foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He probably was
there to deal with the Azure Skysnake to try and force it to become
his slave.” Ning said. At this point, he began to sigh a bit as he
thought back to how he and the Azure Skysnake had battled repeatedly
with each other, with the two being unable to harm each other, and
how slowly, they began to build respect for each other as opponents.
In the end, as he did not find the Azure Skysnake’s corpse within
Ironwood Zhan’s storage treasures, nor did he see the Azure
Skysnake become a tamed slave, Ning understood that the Azure
Skysnake, at that critical juncture, had probably developed its
natural ability, ‘Void Blink’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Azure Skysnake who
had developed the Void Blink technique was like a carp who had
transformed into a dragon! It had definitely left the Swallow
Mountain area to roam the world in search of natural treasures…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was hard to say if
they would ever meet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly returned
to his senses. “When Ironwood Zhan battled the Azure Skysnake, I
took the chance to flee, and I fled over a thousand kilometers out of
the mountain forests…and by the side of a pool, as I rested, I was
lucky enough to suddenly gain an understanding of the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An understanding of
the Dao?” Yichuan and his wife exchanged glances. They held their
breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I spent an entire
night comprehending the Dao, but I didn’t expect that in the end, I
was disrupted by the pursuing Ironwood Zhan.” Ning shook his head.
“However, in my fury, I immediately utilized the Yin and Yang
power, fusing it into the Crimsonbright divine power. Heavenly water
and fire descended upon me, transforming me into a Xiantian
Fiendgod’s body as I became a Xiantian lifeform. At that time, my
power dramatically increased, and I then first killed Ironwood Zhan’s
spirit-beast, that Bi’An Tiger, and then Ironwood Zhan himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said in
surprise, “You killed Ironwood Zhan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning waved
his hand, and within it appeared a black rattan whip. “This is
Ironwood Zhan’s personal weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
Blackwood Vinewhip, Yichuan nodded and sighed in approval. “This is
indeed his Blackwood Vinewhip. As soon as you reached the Xiantian
level, you defeated and slayed Ironwood Zhan. It seems as though that
night you spent comprehending the Dao helped you improve quite
substantially.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “That
night, as I comprehended the Dao, I gained insight into a hint of the
True Meaning of the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The True Meaning of
the Dao?” Even Snow called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it truly the
True Meaning of the Dao?” Yichuan didn’t dare to believe it
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raising one’s
level of enlightenment, the higher one went, the harder it became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the level of ‘one
with the world’ was the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’! Even most
Zifu Disciples hadn’t reached the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’
level! Yichuan, in the past, had only managed to reach this level
thanks to special circumstances, and in addition, this was something
which the Ji clan had held as a secret and never made public. Others
only believed Yichuan to be at the ‘one with the world’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My son is only
eleven.” Snow’s eyes were shining. “But he’s actually reached
the level of the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’, and is training in
what is acknowledged as the number one Fiendgod Body Refining
technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. With this
sort of talent, it would be exceptionally easy for him to be accepted
for tutelage by some of the major powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush, no rush.”
Yichuan looked at his son. “Are you able to actually utilize the
True Meaning of the Dao that you comprehended?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comprehension was one
thing, but being able to utilize it was another thing altogether.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the ancient aquatic
estate, Ning had been in a near-lethal situation when he finally
managed to execute the ‘True Meaning of the Raindrop’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, please
watch.” The Darknorth swords appeared in Ning’s hands, and he
shot a sword into the air. Hua! The tip of the sword seemed like a
drop of rain, causing the air around it to ripple violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Meaning of the
Raindrop!” Yichuan nodded repeatedly. “This is the True Meaning
of the Raindrop. That night you spent comprehending the Dao allowed
you to be able to put the True Meaning of the Dao on display through
your swordplay? This is…this is…” Yichuan didn’t even know
what to say. Swallow Mountain, at least, had never seen such a
monstrous talent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, only in
those distant, super-massive tribes would an equivalent talent exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was only able to
comprehend the True Meaning of the Raindrop in a hidden area.” Ning
said. “I imagine, Father and Mother, that you both knew that I was
trapped within a hidden area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The couple hurriedly
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your son suddenly
disappeared, and caused you such worry, Father, Mother…” Ning,
after seeing his parents, quickly understood this. His father had no
doubt been unable to sense the jade sword, and thus had frantically
rushed over. After all, the aquatic palace was in a completely
different dimension. How could his father sense the jade sword there?
At that time, most likely his father was worried that he was dead.
Ning could completely guess at how his father and mother had felt,
having been worried for so long. He couldn’t help but feel rather
ashamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t your
fault.” Yichuan sighed. “When I was adventuring back in the day,
I saw multiple relic sites, but never entered them. Although relic
sites offer great opportunities, perhaps not even one out of a
hundred will come out of a site alive. Your mother and I are very
happy that you came out of it alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow gently rubbed her
son’s hair as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over this past month,
she truly had been very worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I imagine in
that hidden area, your gains were quite substantial. You were
actually able to execute Serpentwing in one encounter.” Yichuan
said. He didn’t believe that his son would be able to kill
Serpentwing solely after having comprehended the True Meaning of the
Raindrop. After all, Yichuan himself had long ago gained insight into
the True Meaning of the Raindrop. In addition, Yichuan had merged
every single one of the nine sword techniques of the [Raindrop Sutra]
with the True Meaning of the Raindrop, and yet was still unable to
kill Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I received
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].” With a wave of his hand,
Ning retrieved those multiple pieces of fur parchment, offering them
to his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] was a secret, there was no need for Ning
to hide anything from his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]?” Yichuan and his wife both took a look, but as
soon as they did, their faces changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…”
Yichuan and his wife were completely stunned. They were quite
experienced, especially Snow, whose lineage was extraordinary. They
were quickly able to tell how special this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan couldn’t
refrain from saying, “This [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is
even more powerful than any of the ‘ultimate techniques’ of our
Ji clan. Snow, this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is most likely
comparable to your tribe’s [Windwing Evasion] technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off to one side, Ning
couldn’t help but sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That which Fiendgod
Body Refiners needed most was divine abilities! But every single
divine ability, even in the Fiendgod era, was not permitted to be
taught to outsiders. Not even the old black bull in that ancient
aquatic estate had known any. It was only because the Yuchi clan had
helped that Celestial Immortal and saved his life that they had
gained a ‘divine ability’. The value of a divine ability was
perhaps even greater than that of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]! Fortunately, his mother had given this ‘divine ability’
to him, as otherwise, who knows how long it would have taken before
he would have had a chance to learn his first divine ability?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] possesses extraordinary power. It is a
peerless formation technique that can allow a person to battle at a
higher level of power.” Yuchi Snow said. “Only, the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] has very high requirements for magic
treasures as well as the soul. This is its weakness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Several
hundred magic treasures. Who can acquire so many?” Yichuan nodded
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning said, “Father,
Mother, in the hidden area, I acquired many unranked magic treasures.
Simply too many.” As he spoke, he brought out the storage armguard
and gave it to his parents, while at the same time, Ning withdrew all
of his personal ki from within the magic treasures, so as to allow
others to more easily bind them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too many?” Yichuan
accepted the armguard, puzzled. He quickly bound the armguard, and as
soon as he investigated it, he couldn’t help but reveal a look of
shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Snow
immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number of magic
treasures…is most likely in the thousands.” Yichuan sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many!” Snow was
shocked as well. Although they didn’t care about unranked magic
treasures, there were ‘thousands’ of them within. Even the Five
Prefectures of the Ji clan would be envious of such a fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning added, “Those
magic treasures are useless to me. I’ll hand them to Father and
Mother for you to dispose.” He had dozens of storage treasures and
over a thousand sword-type magic treasures, as well as various other
scattered magic treasures, such as wing-type magic treasures…which
was very suited for him to train in the [Windwing Evasion] technique.
The scattered treasures also included some Dao-seals, formations, and
others items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the thousands of
storage treasures, blades, whips, staffs, spears, and axes, he might
as well give all of those to his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had first acquired
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], then shown off so many magic
treasures. His parents had yet to fully recover, before Ning spoke
once more. “This time, in the hidden area, I acquired a treasure.
This will be of true benefit to our Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Yichuan and Snow immediately looked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a wave of Ning’s
hand, a beast fur scroll appeared. Atop the beast fur scroll, a sun
and a moon hung high in the sky, sparkling with boundless light down
upon a Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A visualization
technique!” Yichuan and Snow simultaneously spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with
surprise, “Father, Mother, you know already?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could we not
know?” Snow stared at the painting of the Buddha. “In the past,
my Yuchi clan also had a Visualization painting, but afterwards, the
Visualization painting was lost in a struggle with another tribe. But
Ning, this visualization technique is a technique which can allow one
to strengthen the soul. The soul is a person’s foundation. While
normally it is hard to see the benefits of a strong soul, the
benefits are invisible and tremendous. You should leave this with you
and use it at all times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly said,
“In the hidden area, I was fortunate enough to have a Visualization
painting imprinted directly into my memory! It is even clearer than
this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow, understanding the
situation, said joyfully, “My son’s karmic luck is extraordinary.
According to legends, the ancestor of my Yuchi clan met a Celestial
Immortal, who with but a single finger point imprinted the
Visualization painting directly into his soul. It was even clearer
than the painting, and it could be visualized at all times. I didn’t
expect that in this hidden area, my son would also have such a stroke
of fortune.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thought back to
how, while he was being reincarnated, he had run into the Lord of Cui
Palace in the Netherworld Kingdom, and how the Lord of Cui Palace had
also used a single finger to imprint the [Nuwa Painting] into his
soul’s memory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother, the
name of this visualization technique is the [Inner Visualization of
the Sun-Moon Buddha].” Ning added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s heart was
pounding as he looked at his son. “This [Inner Visualization of the
Sun-Moon Buddha] will have a long-lasting impact on the Ji clan. I
will immediately take it back. However, this [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] should not be publicized for now. It is too hard to train
in, and aside from you, no one in the Ji clan is capable of bringing
forth the power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. After
your own strength improves in the future, you yourself can decide
whether or not you want to publicize it. As for those unranked magic
treasures, I will help you dispose of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it all be as you
decide, Father.” Ning replied.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan looked at
his wife. “Snow, Ji Ning’s strength can be considered at the
absolute top for all below the Zifu Disciple level. The Swallow
Mountain region is unable to contain him any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow nodded as well.
She understood what her man was saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ji Ning
looked at his parents, somewhat puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said, “Ji
Ning, you should know about the six great powers here at Swallow
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded. “Swallow Mountain has six local hegemons. They are our Ji
clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult, the
Ironwood clan, and Snowdragon Mountain. Of the six hegemons, our Ji
clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, and the Blackfire Cult are
allies, while the Ironwood clan and the Snowdragon Mountain are
allied!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six major hegemons
of Swallow Mountain were arrayed into two alliances, and the battles
between them were very fierce, with Xiantian lifeforms often dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan continued, “But
are you aware of the reason as to why the alliance between the
Ironwood clan and Snowdragon Mountain is capable of forcing us other
four hegemons to ally together?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am not.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These secrets were not
recorded in any books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The six great powers
are all guarded by Zifu Disciples.” Yichuan looked at his son.
“Your power is most likely already invincible against anyone below
the Zifu Disciple level. In a few more years, you will most likely
become a Zifu Disciple, so I must tell you these things now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ironwood clan
is not worth mentioning!” Yichuan said seriously, his eyes filled
with a murderous light. “But the Snowdragon Mountain is a truly
formidable enemy. They are truly frightening. In our Swallow Mountain
region, Snowdragon Mountain is merely a single branch of the true
Snowdragon Mountain Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A branch?” Ning
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the six hegemons,
Snowdragon Mountain was the most powerful force. But this Snowdragon
Mountain was merely a branch?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
son and said solemnly, “The power of the Snowdragon Mountain Sect
is thousands of times greater than that of Swallow Mountain’s
Snowdragon Mountain Branch, and thousands of times greater than our
Ji clan! This is a colossal, top-tier clan which is not inferior than
your mother’s Yuchi clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow looked at
her son as well. “The [Windwing Evasion] includes the history of my
Yuchi clan. My Yuchi clan is an extremely ancient, top-tier large
clan. Clans like the Ji clan…are completely incomparable to the
likes of my Yuchi clan. But of course, that was all in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing his
parents speak of these things, instantly had a desire to learn more
about this boundless world. The Yuchi clan, Snowdragon Mountain, and
those legendary, distant top-tier clans. They were all so far away
from Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, do you know
how large the Grand Xia Dynasty is, exactly?” Snow looked at her
son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty
had been founded in the Fiendgod Era, and had destroyed other ancient
dynasties to unify this vast world. It had existed for trillions of
years! The books which described the territory of the Grand Xia
Dynasty all used the same word: Boundless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How enormous would such
a dynasty be? How deep would its roots be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Grand Xia
Dynasty unified the world, it divided the world into 3600
commanderies, and also assigned 800 Marquises!” Snow said slowly.
“Because the world is simply too vast, even Immortals and Fiends
found it difficult to govern it. Thus, they divided it into 3600
commanderies. Amongst these 3600 commanderies, there are large ones
and small ones, but even the smallest are extremely vast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swallow Mountain is
under the governance of the Stillwater Commandery, which is the
territory ruled over by the Marquis of Stillwater.” Snow said. “The
commandery city of Stillwater is nearly a million kilometers away
from us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The commandery city
of Stillwater? A million kilometers away from us?” Ning could
completely imagine how in that distant, distant region, there was an
incomparably ancient, vast, and bustling city. In that place,
Immortals and Fiends congregated, their decisions impacting this
entire enormous region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow continued, “The
commandery city of Stillwater is the seat of power for the entire
Stillwater Commandery, a place where Immortals and Fiends reside.
However, Stillwater Commandery is simply too vast, and there are tens
of thousands of regions within it like our Swallow Mountain…thus,
some of the most top tier clans, schools, and sects are all scattered
throughout the area!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As large as that?”
Ning held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As the saying goes,
the heavens are high and the ruler is far away. With the world
divided into 3600 commanderies, the power of those Marquises in the
territory they rule is absolutely monstrous.” Snow sighed. “The
imperial city of the Grand Xia Dynasty is simply too far away. In
history, there have even been some Marquises who rebelled. Those wars
truly are wars where Immortals and Fiends slaughter each other and
countless experts fall. Truly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flaw of having an
enormous territory was the difficulty one would have in governing it.
Even the high and mighty Marquis of Stillwater was unable to
completely govern his vast territory, and so he allowed the various
tribes to slaughter and battle each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After some of the
Marquises revolted, the Grand Xia Dynasty, so as to better govern the
various regions, began to frantically build one commandery city after
another in the various commanderies, and even Swallow Mountain has
over ten of these commandery cities.” Snow looked at her son.
“Every single city has a matching ‘official writ’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Official writ?”
Ning listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Official
writ!” Snow continued. “By binding an official writ, that means
you are in control of one of those commandery cities, and are in name
one of the officials of the Grand Xia Dynasty. However, these
official writs are ranked magic treasures, and thus only Zifu
Disciples and above can bind them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swallow Mountain has
ten of these commanderies within it.” Yichuan spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the ten
commandery cities, one is Swallow Mountain City, where the armies of
the Grand Xia Dynasty are stationed! Of the other nine cities, our
Five Prefectures of the Ji clan is in control of one, the ‘Thousand
Swords City’ of our Central Prefecture.” Yichuan explained. “The
Riverbank clan, Kou clan, and Ironwood clan all have one as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Blackfire Cult
has two commandery cities. Snowdragon Mountain has three commandery
cities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, long ago,
the Ji clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult,
and the Ironwood clan all were considered part of the local tribes of
Swallow Mountain.” Yichuan sighed. “Afterwards, when Snowdragon
Mountain acquired one of the official writs for one of the cities and
got involved in this region, the Ironwood clan, the weakest of the
clans, quickly threw themselves in with Snowdragon Mountain. However,
we other four powers continue to resist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are all officials
of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and within our own commandery cities, it is
forbidden for Immortal practitioners to battle each other. To disobey
this rule is to challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty, punishable by
death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing his
father’s explanation, couldn’t help but frown. “Father, Mother,
based on what you are saying, if Immortal practitioners are forbidden
from battling within the commandery cities on pain of death, would it
be very hard for one tribe to try and destroy another one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow laughed coldly.
“Easy! For example, Zifu Disciples have a limited lifespan. Upon
death, the official writ becomes an ownerless object, at which point,
the tribe will quickly collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, Zifu Disciples
can’t always stay within their commanderies. As long as they come
out and are killed, then their official writs can be seized and their
tribe will be finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And then of course,
there are some utterly lawless, large, powerful clans!” Snow said.
“They will send people over to your commanderyity to assassinate
the Zifu Disciples of your clan and take away your official writ.
What can you do about it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
“This…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without any proof,
what will you do?” Snow laughed. “But of course, the mightier a
power, the more cautious they will be. Challenging the laws of the
Grand Xia Dynasty is a capital offense. They wouldn’t casually do
such a thing, and even if they decide to, they would use some very
secretive methods. All I am trying to tell you is that there are many
possible ways to destroy a tribe. You might not make trouble for
others, but they might for you. In the end, the most important thing
is strengthening one’s self!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Marquis of
Stillwater controls this vast region, but aside from the armies of
the Grand Xia Dynasty stationed here, there is another squad of
Immortal practitioners, known as the ‘Raindragon Guards’.
According to legend, only Wanxiang Adepts are allowed to join the
Raindragon Guards! By relying on the Raindragon Guards, the Grand Xia
Dynasty is able to better control its vast territory. Remember. The
Raindragon Guards cannot be trifled with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, given your
talent and comprehension, you would find it very easy to request
tutelage under a major power. After you go out adventuring, it would
be best for you to find a major school or power to take shelter
under.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow told
their son many things. They knew that Ning would definitely advance
onto a far greater stage, and perhaps even become a major figure in
the entire Stillwater Commandery…naturally, they carefully
instructed and warned him, telling him everything which they knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning truly
understand how vast the world was. Only now did he know about the
Raindragon Guards of the Grand Xia Dynasty, all formed from Immortal
practitioners. Of the great army controlled by the Marquis of
Stillwater. Of some of the top tier clans, schools, sects…and of
course, many other clans that were powerful in their own localities,
that had been able to control official writs for a long period of
time. Below them, of course, were countless, innumerable minor
tribes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning’s
heart was beginning to fill with ardor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I will take
away the corpse of Serpentwing. To outsiders, we shall simply say
that I was the one to kill him.” Yichuan said. “After all, you
are very young. If we were to publicize that you were the one who
killed him, it will only cause endless difficulties.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let Father
handle all of these things.” Ning said hurriedly. “Right, Father,
I want to build a residence here at Serpentwing Lake. In the future,
I will often live here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Live here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow looked
around them. This area was very peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This is a
good place.” Yichuan nodded. “I will arrange for some people to
help you build a residence here. Your mother and I will go back now.
While adventuring, come back and visit us often.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will. I will go
back to West Prefecture City in a few days.” Ning nodded. He was
going to take a trip to the Blacktooth Tribe to bring Spring Grass’
younger brother to West Prefecture City. This was the promise he had
made to Spring Grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry back.” Snow
gently stroked her son’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He understood that this trip he had made into the Aquatic
Manor had caused his parents great worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That day, Ning led
Autumn Leaf and Mowu back to the Blacktooth Tribe, mounted on their

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The journey from
Serpentwing Lake to the Blacktooth Tribe was a long one. Even with
the black beasts travelling all day and only resting at night, three
days time was needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The campfire was
blazing. Ji Ning and Autumn Leaf were by the side of the campfire,
while Mowu was on watch, so as to not allow any impudent wild beasts
to interrupt his young master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t had the
chance to take a good look at the miscellaneous items I acquired in
the Aquatic Manor.” Ning suddenly remembered that although he had
gone through all those magic treasures he had acquired during the
first and second trials, of the thousands of magic treasures and
miscellaneous items he had acquired at the third trial, he had bound
them then immediately battled that black-furred golem, then met with
that old black bull. He hadn’t had any time to flip through them at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the
miscellaneous items I found in the first or second trial was a secret
manual that is nearly as good as the [Raindrop Sutra]. The number of
miscellaneous items in the third trial was several times greater than
in the first two.” With a wave of his hand, Ning brought out one
item after another, which he then made disappear afterwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf just
watched to the side, curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another secret
manual, the [Clearwind Manual]?” Ning flipped through it, and was
instantly delighted. “It’s actually a swordplay manual, and it
directly instructs one in how to utilize the True Meaning of the Dao.
It is comparable to the [Raindrop Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s judgment and
vision was much keener than before. After all, he had gained insights
into the True Meaning of the Dao, and as he carefully read the
contents, he quickly could vaguely sense that the ultimate goal of
this type of swordplay was to develop the ‘True Meaning of the
Clearwind’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the deceased
people in the corridor were all only at the Xiantian level, so how
powerful or profound could the manuals they were carrying on them
possibly be? Actually, a consummate skill such as the [Clearwind
Manual], logically speaking, shouldn’t even be in there. For
example, Ning hadn’t brought the [Raindrop Sutra] or the
[Thunderflame Sword] with him. From this, one could tell that the
previous master of this manual most likely came from an even more
powerful, top-tier clan who didn’t restrict manuals on this level
too tightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There really were many
miscellaneous items in the third trials, and plenty of treasures as
well. Ning found as many as three powerful techniques! After flipping
through these manuals, Ning began to carefully inspect the other
miscellaneous items, the ones that didn’t look like manuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly flipped out a jade carving!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was two foot long
square piece of jade, and on the jade there was carved an image of an
old man with a long beard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait!” Ning’s
eyes lit up, and he carefully inspected it. At first glance, he had
thought that this was just a carving, but as he took a closer look…he
felt as though the square jade piece was actually covered with
countless small characters that formed some small images. These
characters were the characters used in the Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The characters were
tiny! If an ordinary person saw it, they probably wouldn’t even
notice it, but Ning was no ordinary person. His visual acuity was
astonishing, and he could see a housefly from a distance of ten
kilometers! With such visual acuity, naturally he could read the
dense, tiny characters on the jade carving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How marvelous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This piece of jade
has hundreds of thousands of words carved onto it, and the countless
works actually formed the image of a long-bearded elder.” Ning
first exhaled in amazement, and then he began to search for the place
where these characters originated. Soon, he found that in the
leftmost upper corner, there were four prominent characters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Nine Scrolls on
Formations]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up as
he carefully continued to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Wu Daoyan, have
focused exclusively on formation techniques for over eighty thousand
years. I was lucky enough to survive the last tribulation, but I
think that the next great tribulation in nine hundred years time, I
will not be able to survive. I am unwilling for the essence of my
formation techniques to be lost, and so I have recorded down the
knowledge of my formation techniques within these nine scrolls! I
hope that someone with the right karmic fortune will carefully learn
and comprehend it!” The opening words caused Ning to feel
delighted. Anyone who was capable of living eighty thousand years and
yet still be subject to the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations
was almost certainly a Loose Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua was able
to live for millions of years, but most Loose Immortals weren’t
able to live that long. Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations; the
calamities were easy to avoid, but the tribulations were hard to
escape. A great tribulation every nine hundred years! Each
tribulation more powerful than the last, continuously accumulating
until even a Loose Immortal like of Immortal Juhua, on par with a
Celestial Immortal, would not be able to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The knowledge of a
Loose Immortal regarding formation techniques. This is something that
is no less valuable than the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] or
the [Windwing Evasion].” Ning immediately understood how valuable
this was. “With this knowledge regarding formations, someone
actually went to enter the trials of the underground estate’s
corridors. Jeeze…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person who acquired
this knowledge on formations was most likely someone who was
unskilled in formations. After all, the abstruse mysteries of
formations were very hard to comprehend. Generally speaking, Immortal
practitioners only knew how to set up formations; they didn’t
understand the principles behind the formations. For example, Ning
only knew how to set up and control the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. Immortal practitioners would generally prefer to spend
their time in binding more powerful magic treasures, or more powerful
magic techniques. Those who would lower their heads and study
formations were indeed very rare!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And what’s more,
formations were extremely abstruse and hard to understand, making
researchers in formations even rarer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, the person
who received this didn’t understand it. Even up until the point of
his death, he still hadn’t had any accomplishments, and thus he had
gone to attempt the underground estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was another
possibility as well, that it was someone like Ning…someone who
accidentally entered Serpentwing Lake and thus was forcibly
teleported into the Aquatic Manor, then died within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what
happened, this [Nine Scrolls on Formations] is now mine. And here I
was, wondering how it could be possible that, given there were
thousands of storage treasures, signifying thousands of people, how
could not a single one of them been carrying something truly
valuable?” Ning said to himself joyfully. “I finally acquired a
valuable treasure. Time to take a good look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately lowered
his head and began to read this [Nine Scrolls on Formations].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formations could be set
up using all sorts of things, and some truly miraculous, large-scale
formations could even make the world itself part of the formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.” Many
people felt that the [Nine Scrolls on Formations] were dry and
boring, but Ning began to smile as he read them. Formations required
a high ability to compute and understand. One had to be able to
calculate! Ning, in his previous life, was exceedingly smart. Because
of his illness, he was unable to go to school, so he had to teach
himself everything! He had taught himself through reading books
online, and his knowledge had far outstripped those of the same age
as him, especially in the sciences. Despite his young age, he had
earned a vast fortune!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this life, he had
acquired the [Nuwa Painting] and was able to divide his mind, thus
making his mental computational abilities even nimbler!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous life,
on Earth, the education system had taught Ning how to think. Although
Earth was just one of trillions of little worlds, its educational
system was far superior to this world’s, where, for example,
Swallow Mountain was still at a tribal era of development…even the
descendants of the Ji clan would generally only be able to read,
while the members of lesser tribes wouldn’t even be able to
recognize any characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given this sort of
level of education, it was only natural for everyone here to find it
incredibly hard to analyze formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It can be said that
although perhaps the skilled scientists of Earth wouldn’t
necessarily all become formation experts, they would at least be very
promising prospects in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The education Ning had
received in his past life was like ‘software’. In this life, Ning
had an extremely powerful soul, which was like ‘hardware’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, he was very
well suited for training in formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
is.” Ning revealed a smile while reading. “That Yin Yang Twin
Energy Formation and other formations like it truly are crude. They
completely rely on activating the power of the world. There’s no
skill at all in them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more he read, the
more Ning appreciated it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But slowly, the smile
on Ning’s face disappeared, and it was replaced by a frowning
concentration, mixed with occasional stupefaction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation techniques
really can’t be underestimated.” Ning nodded. “The way of
formations is as vast and boundless as the seas. I’m only able to
understand the most basic principles, but as soon as I see some
slightly more abstruse, complex parts, I am completely lost. It makes
sense. Although in this boundless world, most people are a bit
stupid, there are still many geniuses as well. Upon focusing on
something for hundreds or thousands of years, they will of course
vastly exceed those of us on Earth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
sun is up. We should head out.” Autumn Leaf suddenly called.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?” Ning suddenly
discovered that it was already day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formation techniques
were as boundless as the seas. Upon understanding the first scroll of
the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], one could be considered a
formations expert. Unfortunately, Ning wasn’t able to completely
understand even that first scroll. This caused him to become more
humble and not feel so self-delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Through analyzing
formations, I will have more options and more tactics available to
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, when I use the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], I can make it more nimble and
won’t have to use it in such a static manner.” Although Ning was
just a basic student of this field, he now had a basic understanding
of the way of formations, with the essence of it being ‘guidance’!
For example, at first, when he stupidly just simultaneously
controlled hundreds of flying swords, he had to spend effort
controlling every one minutely, which was simply too mentally
exhausting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, his soul
was very powerful, and so he was easily able to execute the fourth
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he were an
expert on formations, he would be able to have some of the critical
swords ‘guide’ the other swords, which would greatly reduce the
amount of load on his soul, and allow him to easily execute more
powerful levels of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, the
Blacktooth Tribe is up ahead.” Autumn Leaf called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning halt
his pondering on formations. Raising his head, he saw that in the
distance, the sentries of the Blacktooth Tribe had noticed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is young master
Ji.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, hurry and
report this to the leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribesmen of the
Blacktooth Tribe had seen Ji Ning last time. This time, the three of
them were once again travelling together, mounted on the three black
beasts. They were quickly recognized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and the other
two arrived at the gates to the tribe, Blacktooth was there to
personally welcome them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects to you,
young master.” Blacktooth had a large group of tribesmen behind
him, all of them kneeling in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
“Take me to Spring Grass’ place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Blacktooth said hurriedly. The only person in the Blacktooth Tribe
who had any sort of a connection to Ji Ning was Spring Grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly looked
sideways, glancing a skinny toddler standing behind Blacktooth whose
face was rather sickly, yet seemed similar to Spring Grass. Ning
remembered seeing this toddler last time, and thus he spoke out.
“What is your name?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The toddler was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth, following
Ning’s gaze, turned to look at his son. He hurriedly said, “Quick,
response to the young master’s words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the
toddler stutter out, “My name is Bluestone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bluestone,
Bluestone…” Ning gently murmured to himself.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_11___Ji_Ning_is_Here"></A>
Chapter 11 - Ji Ning is Here!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The toddler nervously
looked at the youth riding on the black beast. He only felt that this
youth was a very powerful figure. The entire tribe seemed to be
afraid of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bluestone.” The
youth dismounted from the black beast, then walked over and held his
hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me. Let’s
go to your big sister’s tomb and kowtow to your sister.” Ji Ning
took Bluestone’s tiny hand, and Bluestone, stupefied, just let
himself be led away, not daring to resist. By his side, Blacktooth
and the other tribesmen naturally didn’t dare to argue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that,
they made their way through the tribe before arriving at a large
graveyard behind the tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once again, they came
before that tomb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass. I
came.” Ji Ning had prepared some sacrificial items which he had
prepared when passing through some of the nearby tribes along the
way. He placed all of them in front of the tomb carefully, while at
the same time saying gently, “That Riverside He of the Riverside
tribe is dead now. Serpentwing of Serpentwing Lake is dead as well.
Your enemies are all dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as these words
were uttered, Blacktooth and the others next to him were startled.
What? The Diremonster, Serpentwing, was dead as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bluestone should be
your only remaining little brother.” Ning reached his hand out,
pulling the dumbstruck Bluestone forward. “I swear before your tomb
that I will definitely provide good tutelage to Bluestone”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluestone was somewhat
stunned, but his father, Blacktooth, was incomparably delighted. He
hurriedly said, “Thank you, young master.” He himself was just
the leader of a small tribe. What sort of a future would he be able
to offer his son? But if someone as exalted as the young master of
the Ji clan were to help out, then his son’s future would be very
different.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you don’t
oppose it.” Ning glanced at Blacktooth. “In the future, I will be
spending quite a long period of time by Serpentwing Lake. If you want
to see your son, come to Serpentwing Lake and find me there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Blacktooth
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bluestone, kowtow to
your big sister.” Ning looked towards Bluestone by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Okay.” The toddler
hurriedly knelt down and kowtowed three times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved towards the
side. “All of you can leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
Autumn Leaf included, everyone withdrew. Even Bluestone was led away
by Blacktooth. In this wild, desolate graveyard, the only one
remaining was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just the two of us
now.” Ning withdrew a bamboo reed, beginning to drink wine. “Today,
your young master will spend some time chatting with you. In the
future, I’m afraid I won’t be able to come visit you too often.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning drank fruit wine
in front of the tomb while chatting with ‘Spring Grass’. In the
blink of an eye, an hour passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly frowned. As a Fiendgod-like entity, his senses were
extremely acute. He easily detected minute trembles in the ground.
“Thousands of warriors! And the distance should only be twenty
kilometers. Thousands of warriors, gathering twenty kilometers away?
Can it be that a tribe is about to attack the Blacktooth Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With regards to the
struggles between the various tribes, the Ji clan usually pretended
not to notice them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacktooth was
originally a travelling merchant, and thus should be smooth and slick
in establishing relationships.” Ning was puzzled. “Ever since
founding this Blacktooth Tribe, no other tribes have ever attacked.
Why has a tribe come to attack this time? And with thousands of
warriors at that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a
look.” Ning immediately rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Regardless of whether
it was for Spring Grass or for Bluestone, he couldn’t just stand
and watch with arms folded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Ji clan
usually pretended to not notice these intertribal struggles, once
they did interfere, the tribes they controlled naturally didn’t
dare to disobey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked within the
tribe, heading straight for the gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Mowu and Autumn Leaf hurriedly followed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Blacktooth led his tribesmen to follow him as well. Ning just barked,
“Twenty kilometers outside of here, thousands of warriors are
gathering and advancing towards us. Right. There should be two to
three thousand of them. Your Blacktooth Tribe needs to immediately
prepare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blacktooth was shocked.
“Two or three thousand warriors? Impossible. Only an enormous tribe
would be able to mobilize two to three thousand warriors. A tribe of
that size wouldn’t bother with our Blacktooth Tribe. Our entire
population, including women, children, and the elderly only number
one thousand or so. We aren’t worth such a large military
mobilization!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I say it is so,
then it is so!” Ning glanced at him sideways, saying nothing more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Blacktooth
naturally didn’t dare to say anything else, and he hurriedly began
to shout. “Quick quick quick, enemies are coming to attack!
Quickly, gather around!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” A low
beast horn sound quickly rang out, filling the entire tribe. The
muscular warriors of the tribe, the elderly and the womenfolk, all
grabbed their sabres, swords, spears, and bucklers, while all of the
children hid themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was staring into
the distance at the gates, while all of the tribesmen of the
Blacktooth Tribe were holding their weapons with bated breath in
preparation. All of them were staring towards the distant mountain
forests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They began to clearly
sense footsteps coming. After all, how could two or three thousand
warriors on the march make no sound at all? This caused Blacktooth
and the others to be all the more amazed. It must be understood that
Ning had already informed them long ago of the rough number of people
coming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribesmen of the
Blacktooth tribe were all stunned. From afar, a densely packed swarm
of human figures were emerging from the forests, with the ones in
front armored. It was like a flood of metal coming their way at high
speed, causing the Blacktooth Tribe’s members to feel their hearts
turn cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” The order
came, and the three thousand warriors immediately formed ranks
roughly half a kilometer in front of the Blacktooth Tribe’s gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacktooth Tribe,
listen up!” In front of the enemy troops, a powerfully built bald
man was bellowing. “We are from the Firewing Tribe. Quickly open
your gates and surrender to us, and you have a chance at life. If you
resist, those who resist shall all be killed, while the rest of the
tribesmen shall be sold as slaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice echoed in the
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacktooth Tribe
was in a state of panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many warriors.
There’s thousands of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t young master
Ji here?” The Blacktooth Tribe had no fighting spirit at all now.
First of all, their tribe was newly founded to begin with, as many of
the tribesmen were gathered from those who had fled from other
tribes. They didn’t have too strong a sense of loyalty to the
Blacktooth Tribe yet. And secondly, the Blacktooth Tribe had less
than five hundred tribal warriors, but in front of them there were
three thousand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once battle began, they
would quickly be defeated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the
Firewing Tribe!” Blacktooth hurriedly went forward and said loudly,
“I don’t know why you have come to my Blacktooth Tribe. If you
have any demands, our Blacktooth Tribe will naturally work hard to
meet them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough chitchat!”
The bald man in front of the enemy lines bellowed back. “Surrender
or battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned, glancing
at Mowu by his side. Mowu nodded, then immediately walked forward
while shouting, “Our young master Ji Ning is here. Leaders of the
Firewing Tribe, why haven’t you come to pay your respects yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
come to pay your respects yet!” “Why haven’t you come to pay
your respects yet!” “Why haven’t you come to pay your respects
yet!” The voice echoed within the forests, causing a commotion
amidst the Firewing Tribe as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the center of the
enemy formation, there was a group of men who were riding mounts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji Ning who was
at the Riverside Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from that Ji
Ning, who would dare order the leaders to go pay their respects to
him?” The high-level figures of the Firewing Tribe were all
immediately stunned. The Firewing Tribe was also a large tribe with
more than twenty thousand tribesmen, but because their tribe didn’t
have any Xiantian lifeforms, thus they had already reached their
limits and didn’t dare to expand any further. Compared to the
Riverside Tribe, the Firewing Tribe was on a lower level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Riverside Tribe
wasn’t too far away from them. With over a month having passed,
these higher level members of the Firewing Tribe naturally all knew
of what had happened, and had learned of Ji Ning’s name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chief.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chief.” All of
them looked at black-bearded man whom was escorted in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the side of the
black-bearded man, a youth whose hair fell down his shoulders said in
a low voice, “Nothing more than a descendant of the Ji clan.
There’s no need to pay any attention to a descendant of the Ji clan
in this sort of tribal war. Let’s do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
black-bearded man immediately shouted loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chief!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The high level figures
of the tribe who were around the black-bearded man were all
stupefied. They didn’t expect that their chief, who was both
valorous and wise, would act so stupidly. Given the chief’s status,
he should clearly be aware of what the name ‘Ji Ning’
represented. If it was an ordinary member of the Ji clan, that was
one thing, but this was Ji Ning, who had forced even the Riverside
Tribe to lower their heads before him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Those three
thousand warriors were all ordinary tribesmen. How could they know
what this name ‘Ji Ning’ represented? Hearing their chief’s
orders, they immediately bellowed and charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like an steel flood,
the armored warriors in front charged forward, while the beast-fur
clad men were behind them. The earth shook, and it seemed as though
even the skies grew dark. The tribesmen of the Blacktooth Tribe were
all stupefied, and some even began to cry out, “Surrender, we
surrender!” “We’re finished.” “Quick, run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, standing at
the gates, watched as the dark, dense mass of people charged forward.
Immediately, he was suspicious. “My name should be known to all of
the slightly larger tribes, especially after I acted against the
Riverside Tribe. It should have spread throughout the area under the
control of the Ji clan. Why is the black-bearded leader still
ordering an attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacktooth Tribe
was a small tribe. It didn’t have much wealth. Mobilizing three
thousand warriors to attack it was quite bizarre, in and of itself.
After hearing his, the enemy still decided to attack? That was all
the odder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, just based on
the fact that this Firewing Tribe dared to ignore his name, and just
for the sake of the prestige of the Ji clan alone, he naturally had
to act now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the gates
of the Blacktooth Tribe, Ning suddenly leapt forward like a giant Roc
in flight, instantly flashing through the air. At the same time he
leapt up, enormous waves suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the area
around him, and the incomparably turgid waves instantly formed like
the waters of a flood. Huahuahua…the boundless waves rolled forth,
smashing directly towards those three thousand tribal warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did all this
water suddenly come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian lifeform, a
Xiantian lifeform.” The three thousand warriors were instantly
terrified. They previously had high morale, but upon those rolling
waves crashing upon them, all of them began to collapse and
everything fell to chaos. These warriors all understood that only
Xiantian lifeforms and Diremonsters were able to accomplish the
ability to control fire, water, poisonous gases, and the like. If a
Xiantian lifeform wished to do so, slaughtering three thousand men
was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, Ning didn’t
actually wanted to slaughter them. He only controlled the waves to
smash down upon them. If he used fire or ice to freeze or burn them
to death, the scene would have been completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!” With a
single bound, Ning travelled over a kilometer, landing directly in
front of that black-bearded figure, grabbing him by the neck.

Chapter 12 - Pursuit
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly
landed a kilometer away and grabbed the black-bearded leader,
instantly terrifying the high level members of the Firewing Tribe.
All of them hurriedly knelt down on wobbling knees and called out
repeatedly, “Young master Ji Ning, spare us!” “Young master Ji
Ning, don’t be angry!” “Young master Ji Ning, don’t be
angry!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribal warriors
behind them who had not been hit by the waves, seeing the high level
members of the tribe all kneel down, naturally all knelt down as
well. At this time, the waves disappeared, and those knocked down
tribesmen all knelt in terror as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the black
mass of men were all on their knees, aside from the black-bearded man
Ning had seized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pa!” With a toss
of the hand, the black-bearded man was sent rolling twice on the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning.” The black-bearded man was shuddering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t
recognize me?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-bearded man
shook his man hurriedly. “No, no, I heard of young master Ji Ning’s
fame long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then you still
ordered an attack?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…I…” The
black-bearded man didn’t know what to say for the moment. This
caused Ning to be even more puzzled. The leader in front of him
clearly knew his name, and was frightened of him. So why, then, had
he dared to issue that order?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shouted, “I ask
you, why do you attack the Blacktooth Tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-bearded man
immediately hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The high level members
next to him said hurriedly, “Young master Ji Ning, the Blacktooth
Tribe is only a small tribe. Our Firewing Tribe didn’t want to
attack them at all! Only, the chief insisted on coming. We didn’t
oppose him, as it was just a small tribe and thus not worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was the
decision of the chief and the chief alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We all opposed it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half a year ago, the
chief ignored our opposition and forcibly led the warriors out and
destroyed a small tribe with only a few hundred people, and sold off
everyone, man, woman, child, and elder alike as slaves to his good
friend, Zig! Look, that one right next to the chief is Zig! The chief
trusts him very much!” A silver-haired fur-clad elder pointed to
the long haired youth next to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kneeling long
haired youth suddenly shot out a black light from his sleeves towards
the nearby Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!” Ji Ning’s
body was covered by beast furs, and underneath them he had magic
treasures protecting him. Naturally, this attack was blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning looked
at the long haired youth, but discovered that the youth’s face had
already begin to turn black. At this moment, the other high level
members of the Firewing Tribe were angrily howling and reaching out
with their hands to seize the youth, planning to subdue him. “He
dares to ambush the young master. He deserves death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t touch him!”
Ning immediately barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a muscular man of
the Firewing Tribe who had charged in front had already touched the
arm of the long haired youth. The pitch-black color on the arm of the
youth instantly transmitted to the right arm of the muscular man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” Ning
pointed out with a fingernail, and a ray of sword energy swung out,
chopping the left arm of the muscular man off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long haired youth
slumped to the ground, his entire body pitch black, and his seven
orifices bleeding with black blood. That man whose arm had been
chopped off by Ning had black blood flowing out of his severed arm as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Poison!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
Firewing tribesmen all retreated in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s expression was
grave. “Such fierce poison.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaah!” The chief
of the Firewing Tribe, that black-bearded man, suddenly called out,
then hurriedly pointed at the corpse on the ground. “It was him! It
was him! Young master Ji Ning, it was all him. He originally spat a
mouthful of smoke at me, and I lost my faculties. Although I knew
what was going on, I treated this Zig as my master and obeyed him
from my heart. Whatever he wanted me to do, I would do. Even if he
wanted me to die, I wouldn’t resist at all. When I heard your name,
young master, it was he who ordered me to attack. I clearly didn’t
want to offend you, young master, but as soon as he instructed me, I
immediately gave the order.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-bearded man
stared in shock and fury at the corpse on the ground. “It was that
mouthful of smoke.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The high level members
of the tribe, upon hearing this, were all awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning was
surprised as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the entire Swallow
Mountain area, only the ‘Blackfire Cult’ was in possession of
drugs that could control a person, but the most famous medicine which
the Blackfire Cult had was the ‘Holy Fire Pill’. Upon eating the
Holy Fire Pill, a person would become unswervingly loyal to the
Blackfire Cult and not even fear death! Only, the ‘Holy Fire Pill’
of the Blackfire Cult wasn’t a breath of smoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone capable of
creating this thing is definitely a very powerful warlock or
alchemist.” Ning was secretly startled, and he turned to look at
the leader. “Speak. What did this Zig want from you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To buy slaves!”
The black-bearded man said hurriedly. “He first bought slaves from
us twice, over two thousand slaves! Afterwards, he controlled me and
ordered me to swallow up some smaller tribes and have all the members
of those tribes be sold as slaves to him. He would arrange for those
people to be taken away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. What
was the point of buying so many slaves? Generally speaking, tribes
would buy slaves to use them for manual labor or as servants. Slaves
had to eat as well, and providing enough food for so many wouldn’t
be easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His subordinates?”
Ning asked. “Didn’t you say that he sent subordinates to take the
slaves away? So many slaves, including women, children, and elderly,
would have travelled very slowly. You should be able to find traces
of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can. I can.” The
black-bearded man nodded hurriedly. “Ten days ago, his subordinates
took a group of slaves away. They were headed towards the east. Two
days ago, a hunting squad of our tribe saw that slaver squad. Most
likely, in two days they couldn’t have gone too far. We should be
able to find them quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mowu. Autumn Leaf.”
Ning turned to look into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mowu and Autumn Leaf
immediately ran over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
two looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have something to
take care of.” Ning said. “The two of you, immediately send word
to the nearest station of black armored guards, and have the hundred
closest black armored guards to escort you and Bluestone to
Serpentwing Lake. My father will arrange for a dwelling to be built
at Serpentwing Lake, and you will temporarily live on the island in
the center of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Mowu and
Autumn Leaf assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you.” Ning
looked at the black-bearded man. “You will immediately arrange for
your hunter squads to provide me with two guides. I want to find that
slaving squad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
The black-bearded man hurriedly said, and then roared backwards
behind himself, “Threeknife, Cardcloth, come over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led the two guides
on the backs of the black beasts, traveling by day while resting at
night in hot pursuit. That squad, guiding hundreds of elderly and
infants, naturally travelled much more slowly. They would at most be
able to advance a hundred kilometers a day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, there
clearly are footsteps here.” A swarthy man with braided hair said
hurriedly. “The tracks are very clear. They should have been made
less than a day ago. We will soon catch up to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued the
chase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they saw a large
cluster of figures. All of them, male and female, were fettered by
the hands, with the rope being attached to a tree trunk. A group of
men and women were bound all together, carrying a tree trunk. By
doing so, anyone who attempted to flee would pull others with him,
and once the movement became apparent enough, the slaver escorts
would easily notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, hurry up.”
The slaver escorts were soldiers wielding whips, and they would
occasionally lash out with the whips. As for some of the toddlers,
they were tied up and seated on horses, with eight or ten toddlers
tied up on each horse, allowing them to move more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The looks on the faces
of the men and women were full of grief, and their eyes were filled
with despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a month ago, they
were in their own tribes, living peaceful, happy lives with their
families. But now, they had become slaves and were being escorted to
an unknown area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two, take these
three black beasts and return. Have your tribesmen arrange for them
to be sent to Serpentwing Lake.” With a flip of his hand, Ning
withdrew two beastheads of gold. “You made a trip with me. I won’t
mistreat you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master.” The two tribesmen hurriedly thanked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
patted his black beast. He had ridden this black beast while
adventuring. After having spent so much time with it, he was rather
reluctant to part with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can go now.”
Ning immediately dismounted, then began to travel by himself. After
all, this squad was moving very slowly. There was no need for him to
ride the black beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slaver squad
continued to advance through the mountain forests. On the road,
although they encountered some monstrous beasts, the slaver escorts
were powerful experts, almost all of them peak Houtian level, with
three of them being Fiendgod Houtian experts. They easily killed the
monstrous beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed odd.”
Ning said to himself. “Large-scale purchasing of slaves, and using
medicines to control the leader of a tribe to engage in the
large-scale capture of slaves. Even the slaver escorts have peak
Houtian Fiendgod practitioners.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re almost
there.” The slaver escorts seemed to be rather happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly followed
from behind. This place was already at what was considered the border
between the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan, while up ahead was a chain
of mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This group of slavers
were heading towards the mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter the
mountains.” The squad continued forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved from behind,
but just as they arrived at the base of the mountain, the sun which
been bright in the sky suddenly changed as soon as Ning followed them
into the mountains. It was as though day had suddenly transformed
into night. The area around them had turned pitch black, and only
some faint details of the surrounding area could be made out. The
entire area seemed to be covered with black fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog was
everywhere, and it was filled with a cold aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formation.” Ning
immediately understood that he had entered a formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone actually
came to die. Hahaha!” An evil, ear-piercing laugh suddenly rang
out. “Little human child, your flesh will definitely be very
delicious. I will slowly devour you bite by bite.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there,
staring into the endless black fog surrounding him. He could just
barely see to a distance of ten meters. Beyond that, he couldn’t
see anything. In his hands, the two Darknorth swords had already
appeared.

Chapter 13 - Zifu Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and kill
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even as a ghost, I
won’t forgive you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaargh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no, no!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing in the middle
of the boundless darkness of the great formation, sounds could
vaguely be heard from everywhere, as though many people were
suffering terrifying torments. Ji Ning was secretly startled. “They
wildly purchased so many slaves, and even controlled the leaders of
some tribes to snatch up some slaves through battling other tribes.
What are they doing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what,
first I have to leave.” Ning stared seriously at his surroundings.
With a ‘swoosh’, he charged forward, moving more than a
kilometer. And then, he once more turned and began to sprint,
retreat, leap forward…within the pitch black, foggy formation, Ning
moved around at high speed for a long time, but no matter where he
moved, he remained within the formation filled with the dark fog and
cold air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning’s
face changed slightly. “This is no ordinary maze formation. I moved
at such high speed and constantly changed directions, but the
formation remained utterly stable. The person controlling this
formation is most likely not a Xiantian lifeform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this past month
of pursuit, Ning had focused on training in the [Nine Scrolls on
Formations] and had made some accomplishments. Although he was unable
to easily defeat the formation in front of him, he was able to
tell…this was far above the likes of simple formations such as the
Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation. It was an extremely intricate
formation, and a magic treasure capable of setting up this sort of
formation would have to be considered a ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way for a
Xiantian lifeform to bind a ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A person on the
level of a Wanxiang Adept wouldn’t deign to act in such a manner in
a place like Swallow Mountain. Nine out of ten…the person who set
up this formation should be a Zifu Disciple, and one specialized in
using poisons.” Ning quickly came to this conclusion based on what
he had encountered previously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human child, I’m
coming for you.” The ear-piercing laugh reverberated within the
endless black mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
completely unmoving, while at the same time, around him appeared
three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals. The two layers
of lotus petals slowly swiveled around Ning in opposite directions…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” A
sinister laughter echoed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shadow suddenly leapt
forth from the dark mist, pouncing towards Ning. But when that shadow
saw Ning being protected by the Waterflame Lotus, it paused slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
eyes had a fierce look flash past them, and he immediately charged
forward, his Darknorth sword in his hand transforming into a ray of
firelight as he executed the ‘Thunderflash Flint’, chopping the
shadow in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shadow instantly
split into mist, then glided backwards before reforming into a mutant
beast. Hidden in the darkness, there was no way to clearly see the
mutant beast at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t a human
child, this is a human Xiantian lifeform who has been training for
who-knows how many years!” The ear-piercing sound emanated out from
the mist, travelling a long distance. “This human most likely broke
through to become a Xiantian when very young, and so his features
remain so very young. In addition, he has a protective lotus
surrounding his body. The lotus flower around his body should be a
magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far off in the
distance, another clear, cold voice echoed forth. “If he isn’t a
Zifu Disciple, he doesn’t matter. Just kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll handle it.”
The mutant beast in front of Ning, hidden in the mist, said directly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning’s
face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he isn’t a Zifu
Disciple, he doesn’t matter. For someone to dare say something like
this most likely meant that the person who set up this formation
really was a Zifu Disciple! In addition, the one who had attacked
just now was nothing more than a monstrous beast, most likely a
spirit beast under the command of that Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Master said.”
The mutant beast in the mist slowly began to change positions,
occasionally appearing here, and then over there. “When adventuring
in the outside world, the younger a human you encounter, the harder
they are to deal with. It looks like his words weren’t wrong…but
unfortunately, you ran into me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a person reached
the Xiantian lifeform stage, that person would no longer be a mortal,
and his appearance would remain virtually unchanged. Only when he
began to reach the limits of his life would he slowly age. Thus,
elderly looking Xiantian lifeforms were virtually all over a century
old. Ji Yichuan, who had first made his name echo in Swallow
Mountain, and then had gone out adventuring for many years before
bringing his wife back, was now nearly fifty, but he still looked
exactly as he had when he was a youngster. If a Xiantian lifeform
looked like a child, then that meant that he became a Xiantian
lifeform when he was a child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the younger one
appeared, the harder they were to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even some Immortals
might have the appearance of a child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” “Swish!”
“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, three black
rays shot towards Ning, but when they hit those swiveling lotus
petals of fire and water which were protecting Ning, they just barely
broke through the first layer of lotus petals, but the second layer
successfully blocked them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous black
shadow emerged from the mist, and an enormous claw grabbed towards
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dang!” Ning’s
sword light flashed, and the grab attempt was blocked while Ning
himself dodged to the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned
as he looked. This was a mutant beast which looked like a panther.
Ning was actually momentarily unable to recognize what sort of mutant
beast this was, primarily because many mutant beasts had mixed
lineages, which would often resulted in mutant beasts. The mutant
beast in front of him could only be said to look similar to a Bi’an
Tiger. Its body was extremely long. The mutant beast stared at Ning,
its tail swaying. Its tail had circles of black bony spikes which, if
struck onto a person’s body, would definitely be no weaker than a
whip-type magic treasure striking a person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pupils
contracted, and he transformed into a blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windwing Evasion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moving as fast as
lightning, he pounced towards the mutant beast, and the mutant
Diremonster’s twin claws snatched towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks!” A water-like sword light flashed past, seeming like a drop
of water falling down, and with a thundering sound, that mutant
Diremonster collapsed to the ground, rolling a few times before
coming to a halt, no longer moving. Its head had a large hole in it,
with blood and brain matter flowing outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quietly landed on
the ground, still holding his twin swords as he cautiously stared
around himself. He only glanced sideways at the mutant beast.
“Nothing more than a late-stage Xiantian level Diremonster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black Needle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black Needle!”
From afar came the call of that cold voice. “Is that human dead
yet? Black Needle! Black-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quickly, that clear,
cold voice went silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I killed the mutant,
but he didn’t know about it. It seems that mutant beast wasn’t
his spirit-beast.” Ning understood that there wasn’t necessarily
only a single Zifu Disciple here in this mountain. It was very
possible that a hidden power was here! But the person capable of
setting up this sort of formation had to at least be a Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is big
trouble.” Ning hadn’t imagined that in the Swallow Mountain area,
at the borders of the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan, such a powerful
force was hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was trapped within
the great formation. The protective Waterflame Lotus swirled around
him, and in his mind, he was constantly pondering formations. The
[Nine Scrolls on Formations] were abstruse, especially those
extremely hard to memorize diagrams, but Ning had still been able to
forcibly commit the contents of the first scroll to memory. He was
currently using the greater part of his mental power to analyze them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to break this
formation. While trapped here, all I can do is allow them to use
whatever techniques they have against me.” Ning focused on
analyzing the formation, while constantly hearing miserably cries,
fierce curses. It seemed as though a true hell was hidden within this
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji clan of the West
Prefecture. Snowfall Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Young was seated at
the throne of the palace, while Ji Yichuan, Ji Lee, and others were
all seated below him, their faces all solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past ten
days.” Ji Lee’s voice was rather hoarse, and his eyes were rather
red. “The Five Prefectures of our Ji clan has already had multiple
Xiantian lifeforms disappear! We have neither found them alive nor
found their corpses!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prefecture Lord, who
has come to the territory of our Ji clan to cause trouble?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Find them and
destroy them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve almost gone
crazy in the past few days. My close friend! I must find him and
rescue him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the Ji
clan seated below couldn’t help but howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Lee, glaring, let
out a hiss, “My son has gone missing as well. I must find him, I
must!” And then, he looked at the Prefecture Lord, seated in the
throne. “Elder brother, up till now, how many Xiantian lifeforms
have gone missing? Also, who exactly is acting against our Ji clan?
Have we found the culprit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on the news
which the Central Prefecture just sent over, up till now, already
twenty three Xiantian lifeforms have gone missing.” Ji Young shook
his head. “And most of them are fairly powerful and quite famous
Xiantian lifeforms! The Five Prefectures of the Ji clan have lost
five of our Commanders who were outside. As for where they have gone,
there’s no trace of them at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is provoking
our Ji clan. They show no regard for the Ji clan at all.” Lee
bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young’s eyes were
red. “All the ones who went missing were quite powerful and were at
least mid-stage Xiantian lifeforms. There were even late-stage
Xiantian lifeforms, and even peak Xiantian lifeforms! They are
running roughshod over our Ji clan, then pissing on our faces! We
have to find the culprits! No matter how great the price, we must
destroy them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, seated to one
side, spoke out. “They must be destroyed indeed. However, based on
my experience, this power should have a Zifu Disciple guarding it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Everyone
looked towards Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, after all, had
gone adventuring outside. He had even gone to the Darknorth Seas. His
experience was greater than theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan continued,
“There are two possibilities which have the greatest likelihood.
The first is that it should be some sort of fleeing tribe, who lost
their city and no longer have a base and were sent wandering…but
the remnants of this tribe are still very powerful. Thus, they want
to cause a battle here in Swallow Mountain and conquer a commandery
city through it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a commandery city,
they would have their own territory. Only then would a tribe have a
base!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second
possibility is that it is a fleeing Immortal practitioner. The
Immortal practitioners of some evil sects will use souls and corpses
to train in some evil magic spells. Snatching Xiantian lifeforms is
done because Xiantian lifeforms have more powerful souls, and can be
better used to train in some magic spells.” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the
disappearance of Xiantian lifeforms,” Yichuan continued, “Based
on the intelligence of our Ji clan, is not just limited to the Ji
clan, but also the nearby Ironwood clan! The Riverbank clan has
Xiantian lifeforms missing as well. Only, we don’t know how many
Xiantian lifeforms they have lost. For them to act so wildly means
that the power which has come to our Swallow Mountain is not weak. We
absolutely must get revenge, and we must rescue the missing Xiantian
lifeforms, but we cannot be rash. We need to first discover the true
situation regarding the opponents, and then set a strategy to destroy
them at one blow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the palace
went silent.

Chapter 14 - Revered Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan walked by
himself on the stone brick road, his forehead furrowed in thought. He
knew that this affair would be a tough trial for the Ji clan, but any
organization which wanted to survive in this world would have to be
able to endure repeatedly trials! After passing them, the roots of
the clan would naturally grow deeper and grow more powerful. But if
they weren’t able to pass them, then the clan would be
exterminated! It would be lucky if even a few survivors managed to
flee and pass down the bloodline.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Some of
the servants knelt down on the side to welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan walked into his
residence, then headed back to the place where he normally stayed.
Suddenly, a female servant hurriedly rushed over. Upon seeing
Yichuan, she was so frightened, she immediately knelt down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you in such
a rush? Consider your image!” Yichuan frowned and barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
female servant’s face was white with tension. “Madame, Madame,
she…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s face
instantly changed. “What’s wrong with Snow?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madame fainted!”
The female servant said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fainted?”
Yichuan’s face instantly turned white. As an expert Ki Refiner, how
could she faint? If his wife fainted, there could only be one reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow!” Yichuan
instantly turned into a gust of wind, disappearing from that area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow was quietly
lying on the bed. Her face was rather pale, but her features were
still so beautiful, so calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow.” Yichuan
instantly appeared within the room. Seeing his wife lying there, he
hurriedly walked forward and carefully inspected her. He couldn’t
help but glance at the female servant. “What exactly happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female servant was
shaking in terror, and had knelt down long ago. “Master, the Madame
had been drinking tea and was perfectly fine. Nobody touched the
Madame, and nobody spoke with the Madame. But suddenly, the Madame’s
body turned weak and she just collapsed. All of us panicked. I
carefully lifted the Madame back into the room, while Keepleaf went
to call you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this
happen.” A look of agony was on Yichuan’s face. “How could this
happen! Quick, quick, go have Shaman Cao immediately come over!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The female
servant immediately retreated, leaving behind only Yichuan and his
wife in the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan sat at the side
of the bed, looking at his wife. He stretched his hand out to stroke
her face, murmuring, “Is this day truly here? When you gave birth
to Ning, I feared that this day would come. I don’t believe it. I
don’t believe it. You will definitely survive. I will accompany you
and we will both watch our son become into an incredible hero.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A big-bearded old man
dressed in filthy animal skins walked in. His body naturally carried
an herbal fragrance. Shamans and apothecaries were a group of people
who had a great deal of experience in natural herbs and remedies. The
boundless world was a very miraculous place, and it had all sorts of
curious types of things living within it. Even the most seemingly
ordinary herbs, once combined in a certain manner, could have some
unique effects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Shaman Cao was one
of the most skilled in herbs in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shaman Cao.”
Yichuan looked towards the big-bearded elder. “My wife just fainted
for no reason. You take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander, please
step back.” Shaman Cao said in his hoarse voice, and Yichuan
hurriedly moved to the side, stepping back to make way for him.
Shaman Cao stretched out his dry hand, as skinny as a chicken claw,
placing it against Snow’s forehead. Instantly, a spot of green
light was birthed from Shaman Cao’s palm, and it began to slowly
seep into Snow’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A very strong herbal
odor began to fill the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shaman Cao closed his
eyes. After a long time, Shaman Cao took his hand back. As for Snow,
who had previously been in a state of unconsciousness, her eyebrows
trembled, and then she opened her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow.” Yichuan,
shocked and overjoyed, hurriedly went forward while at the same time
looking at Shaman Cao. “How is my wife?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please forgive me
for my inability.” Shaman Cao shook his head. “Commander, you’d
best go invite the clan leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The clan leader?”
Yichuan’s heart clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clan leader was the
clan leader for the entire Five Prefectures of the Ji clan. His name
was Ji Ninefire. An old fellow who had lived for nearly four hundred
years, a true ancestor of the Ji clan. Of course, he was also a Zifu
Disciple! Ji Ninefire loved to research, and had significant
accomplishments in both formations, medicines, and poisons. In terms
of medical treatment, he was naturally incomparably superior to
Shaman Cao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll immediately
take Snow over to him.” Yichuan said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Shaman Cao
said hurriedly. “Commander, you cannot be rash. The Madame
currently can’t withstand any shaking or bumping. She needs to
quietly recuperate. If you can invite the clan leader to come, that
would be for the best.” Shaman Cao came to a halt. He knew that
inviting the clan leader to come would be very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded, then
immediately instructed a nearby maidservant, “Immediately go invite
Commander Ji Redflower over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redflower, dressed in
red clothing, walked in. “Yichuan, what do you need me for?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunty Flower.”
Yichuan, upon seeing this person, hurriedly said, “I want to ask
you to ride on your Azure Firebird and immediately head to the
Central Prefecture. Invite the clan leader to pay a visit to our
Western Prefecture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invite the clan
leader?” Redflower was startled. The clan leader had stopped
managing the clan’s affairs long ago, and spent all of his time in
research and training…even if Ji Young, the Prefecture Lord of the
Western Prefecture went to invite him, the clan leader still probably
wouldn’t come. “If I go invite him, would he come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said hurriedly,
“Just tell him that I, Ji Yichuan, have a life-and-death matter and
that I am asking the clan leader to come to the Western Prefecture
City. The clan leader will definitely come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Redflower was
still puzzled at why Yichuan was so confident that the clan leader
would definitely come, she still nodded. “Fine. I’ll go make a
visit to the ‘City of Ten Thousand Swords’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty
had erected countless commandery cities throughout the world. The Ji
clan was only in control of a single one, the ‘City of Ten Thousand
Swords’. This was the ‘Central Prefecture’ of the Five
Prefectures of the Ji clan! As for the Eastern Prefecture, Western
Prefecture, Southern Prefecture, and Northern Prefecture, they had
all been built by the Ji clan, and had nothing special about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to trouble
you.” Yichuan said in thanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redflower immediately
left, then quickly mounted her Azure Firebird and left the Western
Prefecture City, heading towards the City of Ten Thousand Swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maidservants in the
room had left as well, leaving behind only Yichuan and his wife,
Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Snow
smiled, lifting her head up to look at her man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow.” Yichuan sat
by the side of the bed, holding his wife’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow shook her head
gently. “I know it. You know it too. When we returned from the
Darknorth Sea and suffered that attack on the way back, we were very
lucky to be able to survive and return. The past ten years have been
very calm and very happy. I am already content.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If, if that year,
you hadn’t given birth to Ning…” Yichuan’s voice was somewhat
hoarse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow gently shook her
head. “This is our child. I had to give birth to him. Even though
using the secret technique resulted in me losing some years of my
life, it was worth it! I had been heavily injured. If I hadn’t
given birth to Ning then, who knows if I would have been able to give
birth later on. Ning has the blood of both of us in his veins. And
what’s more, his life was bought using the life of my elder
brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother.”
Yichuan still remembered that great battle they had fought on the way
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That great battle had
changed the fate of three people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yuchi siblings, and
himself, Ji Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, take my
little sister and go! Quick, go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The image of that tall,
powerful back. That furious roar. Yichuan had never forgotten it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we gave up Ning,
perhaps I would have been able to live for a few more years, but I
wouldn’t have been able to have a child with you. I would have
regretted it my entire life. He has the bloodline of the Ji clan, and
he also has the bloodline of my Yuchi clan.” Yuchi Snow said
gently, “I’ve had ten years by your side, and I also have an
incomparably clever son…I am incomparably happy and incomparably
satisfied. These past ten years, I have felt very blessed and very
happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan gently held his
wife’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning is my pride and
joy.” Snow said slowly. “I don’t regret giving birth to Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
nodded gently. “I understand. Understand. In less than two hours,
the clan leader will be here. Let the clan leader take a look.
Perhaps it isn’t too terrible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow nodded. “If I
can live for another year or two, let’s not tell Ning about this
for now. If I won’t be able to live for much longer, then let Ning
return.” And then, Snow looked towards her man, her eyes shining.
“Yichuan, I am so blessed to have had you and Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yichuan
looked at his wife and said gently, “I feel the same way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But neither Yichuan nor
Snow knew that right now, their son Ning was in dire straits. He was
in the great mountain between the borders of the Ji clan and the
Ironwood clan, which from afar seemed ordinary and unremarkable. Upon
entering this mountain, however, one would fall into a pit of endless
dark fog and never come out again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The protective lotus
petals swiveled around him. Ning sat there in the lotus position,
currently focusing on the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], constantly
hypothesizing and thinking about how to break this formation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the midpoint of the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One miserable scream
after another emanated from places throughout the midway point of the
mountain. All sorts of furious, hateful curses, wild pleas, and sobs
all constantly assaulted the ears, while in the center of the
mountain, there were multiple pillars with men and women bound to
them. At a glance, one could see over a hundred men and women, their
bodies covered in scars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beaten, humiliated,
tormented…all sorts of cruel methods had been used on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian lifeforms?
You still think you are Xiantian lifeforms? Hahaha, drink it all,
drink some of this wonderful urine to quench your thirst!” The
muscular servants were wildly tormenting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing in the center
of the mountain, there were six beautiful dressed men and women. They
calmly watched all of this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve purchased
more than a million ordinary slaves in this Swallow Mountain region,
and seized nearly a hundred Xiantian lifeforms. However, we are still
quite a ways off from the requirements of Master.” A black-clothed
woman who had a scorpion on her shoulders said slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother is currently outside capturing Xiantian lifeforms.
We’ll quickly be at the necessary numbers.” A handsome youth
smiled. “However, one of Master’s spirit-beasts, Blackneedle,
went to kill an enemy within the formation, but was instead killed.
My fellow apprentice-brothers and apprentice-sisters, how do you
think we should deal with this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Younger
apprentice-brother, you are naturally talented. It’s best if you
go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Younger
apprentice-brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby men and
women all looked at the handsome youth. Seeing the situation, his
face darkened. None of these fellow martial apprentices were fools.
Although all of them has extraordinary abilities, since they knew
that the person within the formation could easily kill the
spirit-beast ‘Blackneedle’, none of them were willing to go.
After all, going meant encountering some risk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kakaka…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From within the
mountain, a location began to turn and swivel. One metal plate after
another began to move open, revealing a corridor. Within the dark
corridor, there was a hint of green light, and an icy cold aura swept
out from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The six
men and women all called out respectfully in unison.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 15 - Wraith
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the dark abyss
below came a sharp yet calm voice. “Little Seven, you are the most
clever. You can go handle this matter. Get rid of this intruder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, revered
Master.” The handsome youth didn’t hesitate at all as he replied
with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the words
ended…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kakaka…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The metal board
immediately rose up from the floor, once more tightly sealing away
that corridor. Only now did those six men and women let out sighs of
relief. Although they were their master’s closest disciples,
whenever they faced their master, they still felt terrified. This was
because those disciples who had dared to offend their master had all
been tortured to death, and would never even have the chance to be
reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who knows what sort
of magic treasure Master is currently refining.” A violet-clothed
young man said softly. “All together, from start to finish,
including the people we tortured to death in other places, we’ve
killed hundreds of Xiantian lifeforms, and an uncountable number of
ordinary people. Master even said that once he finishes with this
magic treasure, even if he encounters a Wanxiang Adept, he won’t be
afraid. Who knows what sort of magic treasure this is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It definitely is a
terrifyingly powerful one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, Master’s
magic treasure is only half completed, but he already pays no
attention to those Zifu Disciples located in the tribes of Swallow
Mountain. When he truly completes is…” The six men and women
chatted softly. They were very curious about this mysterious magic
treasure which their master was busy creating, but unfortunately,
their master had remained deep within his study this entire time and
had forbidden anyone from entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for that tunnel, as
soon as it shut, not a single sound would come from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurry, savage ghost
suddenly came out from the body of one of the Xiantian lifeforms
bound to the pillar. It let out a soundless scream, and then that
blurry ghost sank down into the stones, being gathered to the depths
of the mountain, towards that hidden room. This scene caused those
six men and women to feel nervous. Only a true dread wraith would be
visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another wraith!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six men and women
thought back to their second apprentice-brother, who had offended
their master. He had been tortured to death, and then he had been
transformed into a dread wraith, then been absorbed in. Even wraiths
were being drawn down…clearly, whoever died there would never have
the chance for rebirth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Seven, go
deal with the enemy in the formation.” His fellow apprentices
exhorted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop rushing me.”
The handsome youth immediately walked outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark fog was
everywhere. The handsome youth quietly moved forwards, and everywhere
he went, that black fog automatically opened a pathway for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dao-seal appeared out
of nowhere in the handsome youth’s left hand. On the surface of the
Dao-seal, there was a blood vessel like pattern of strange
characters. On his right hand, a horsetail whisk appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” With
a flip of the horsetail whisk, hundreds of white strands of light
immediately transformed to a size of dozens of meters, swirling
around towards the lotus-position seated Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position. Suddenly, he sensed something, and he raised his
head to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire area around
him was filled with those white strands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning
barked softly, and the Waterflame Lotus that had been swiveling
around him instantly increased greatly in size. The two enormous
layers of lotus petals swiveled, and those invading white strands
that had sought to entangle him were all snapped, completely unable
to draw near Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Controlling fire and
water?” The pupils of the distant, handsome youth immediately
contracted. “It seems he is a Fiendgod Body Refiner at the Xiantian
level. This will be troublesome. I had wanted to rely on my horsetail
whisk to directly seize him, but it seems that won’t be possible.”
The hundreds of white strands quickly returned, then disappeared. In
his right hand, a long whip appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve invaded our
formation. Immediately report your name!” The handsome youth
shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was already on his
feet, and he glanced at the handsome youth. “This is the border
between the Ironwood clan and the Ji clan, but you seem to neither be
of the Ji clan nor of the Ironwood clan. Who are you, exactly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I told you, you’d
be frightened to death.” The handsome youth sneered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you give
it a try and see if I’ll be frightened to death.” Ning wielded a
sword in each hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only thing you
need to see is my whip.” The handsome youth didn’t continue the
conversation. Clearly, he didn’t want to explain where he was from.
He immediately struck out with his whip, and the black whip slashed
through the air, elongating at high speed. By the time it reached
Ning, the whip had already transformed into a black serpent head
which bit straight at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just looked at it.
As soon as the long black whip broke through the first layer of the
fire lotus, it was blocked by the second later of the water lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
technique is that lotus of fire and water?” The handsome youth
wasn’t like that spirit-beast from earlier; he could immediately
tell that Ning was a Fiendgod Body Refiner who could control fire and
water, but he didn’t understand how Ning’s technique worked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who had
previously been just calmly looking at the whip, suddenly without any
warning began to use the Windwing Evasion technique. He instantly
leapt over towards that handsome youth at an astonishing speed. At
the same instant he leapt forward like a gust of smoke, the Darknorth
swords in his hands executed Raindrop Pierces Rocks, stabbing
straight towards the head of the handsome youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to deal with.
Flee!” This entire time, the handsome youth had been clutching that
Dao-seal in his left hand. He suddenly activated it and it
transformed into a blurry shadow and entered his body…and then the
handsome youth suddenly disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning appeared
in front of where that handsome youth had been. He began to frown.
“An escape technique? He should have relied on that Dao-seal to use
this technique. A Xiantian Ki Refiner actually has an escape-type
Dao-seal. The Zifu Disciple behind him definitely dotes on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao-seals were divided
by class as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Speed Seal,
Light Body Seal, Diamond Seal, Giant Strength Seal, and other
Dao-seals were all the lowest class seals, which escape seals were
clearly on a higher level. For example, the ‘Traceless Talisman’
was a type of Dao-seal that was so precious you couldn’t even buy
it with money. Only, unfortunately, he wasn’t carrying the
‘Traceless Talisman’ on him. Even if he was, because Ning was
trapped within this formation, he was unable to tell which direction
he was in, there was no way that Ning could use it to go directly
into the insides of the mountain. Of course, he could still rely on
the Traceless Talisman to immediately flee, but unfortunately, he
didn’t have it on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I have
Escape Seals on me, this trapping formation has activated the five
elements. I’m completely unable to ‘escape’.” Ning was
certain about this. He had pondered for a long time, and he could be
considered to have a good level of attainment in formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had some
understanding regarding the formation he was trapped in as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the five elements
were activated, there was no way to ‘escape’, unless the master
of the formation voluntarily helped out. Unfortunately, the master of
this formation only wanted his death. How could he help out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
quickly charged back to the midway point of the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Seven’s
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Younger apprentice
brother, have you executed the enemy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With our younger
apprentice brother having personally intervened, he definitely
captured the trespasser with ease.” Those fellow apprentices,
seeing the look on the handsome youth’s face, immediately knew that
he had definitely failed, so they immediately began to ridicule him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
barked back, “Fellow apprentices, you have no idea as to how
powerful this enemy is. If I had just been a bit slower in fleeing, I
probably would have lost my life to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that
formidable?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does he have some
sort of powerful magic treasure?” The other five men and women were
all astonished. They knew how powerful this younger
apprentice-brother of theirs was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth said
hurriedly, “He is just like our senior apprentice-brother. He
trains in both ki and Body! He is a Xiantian level practitioner as a
Fiendgod Refiner as well, and he was able to reach me in an instant.
Fortunately, I had been holding the Escape Seal from the very
beginning, and so I was lucky enough to escape. His speed alone
indicates that he is probably a peak Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body
Refiner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A peak Xiantian
Fiendgod Body Refiner?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did such a
powerful figure suddenly come from?” The other five fellow
apprentices were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
sighed, “It seems we’ll have to wait for our senior
apprentice-brother. Senior apprentice-brother has already reached the
peak Xiantian level in both ki and Body, and he also has all sorts of
magic treasures and poisons…the large majority of the hundred
Xiantian lifeforms we have caught in the Swallow Mountain area were
all captured by senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is speaking
about me?” A low voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six men and women
hurriedly turned to look. At the halfway point of the mountain, near
that enormous cave entrance, a man dressed in a black cloak with
unbound hair walked in. That icy, sinister aura was just the same as
their revered master’s. The man was currently carrying a large
sack. As he walked into the mountain estate, he tossed the bag to the
floor. At the opening of the bag, some feet could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” The six men and women immediately called out
respectfully. They all knew exactly how formidable their senior
apprentice-brother was. They had all fled secretly with their master,
and on the way, their senior apprentice-brother had even battled once
against a Zifu Disciple and lived to tell the tale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I went to the Kou
clan’s territory and seized these three Xiantian lifeforms. I’ve
already destroyed their dantian’s. Go tie them up.” The black
cloaked man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, servants
charged forward and dragged out the three people in the sack. One
woman, two men. The woman was incomparably charming, but in a dazed
state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So even the
bewitching beauty, ‘Kou Hua’, was captured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the Kou
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captured Ji clan,
Ironwood clan, and Riverbank clan Xiantian level members of the
Swallow Mountain region all glanced over. Immediately, the
black-cloaked man’s face turned savage, and his eyes emanated a
green light. “I ordered you to torment them, torment them until
they go insane, torment them until they died. But look at them; they
actually have the presence of mind to look at these three. If you
aren’t able to torment to death, if a single one of them doesn’t
become a dread wraith, then I will make sure all of you become dread
wraiths!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yesyesyes.” Those
servants were absolutely terrified, and then all of them threw
themselves forward, using all methods at their disposal to torment
these Xiantian lifeforms with destroyed dantians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing their senior
apprentice-brother angry, the other six men and women were all
frightened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
turned his head to look at his fellow apprentices. “Just now, you
were speaking of me?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_16___Clansmen"></A>
Chapter 16 - Clansmen
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, within the formation with our revered master set
up, an enemy who secretly entered has been trapped. He looks just
like a youth.” That handsome youth addressed as ‘Little Seven’
immediately said. “But his power is astonishingly great. Even one
of Master’s spirit-beasts, ‘Blackneedle’, was killed, and I
almost lost my life as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
frowned. “Oh? He’s that powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very powerful. That
enemy is also both a Ki Refiner and a Body Refiner. He should be a
peak Xiantian expert. Only you, senior apprentice-brother, will be
able to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once senior
apprentice-brother uses his ‘Intoxicating Dragonspit’ technique,
no matter how powerful he is, he will definitely faint and be easily
captured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
boasting and praising him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
looked at the fellow disciples. “Just a single intruder causes all
of you to feel helpless! Hmph, Master is currently busy forging his
magic treasure and cannot spare any attention. Since the six of you
aren’t able to do anything else competently, then you can go
personally torment those Xiantian lifeforms. At least you’ll be
helping Master with his magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, senior
apprentice-brother.” The six men and women all responded in unison,
and then all of them picked up the various tools on the floor and
began to walk towards those Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those bound Xiantian
lifeforms who had their dantians destroyed were virtually all from
the Swallow Mountain region. As for the other Xiantian lifeforms,
they were extremely rare, because most had been tortured to death
long ago. Even the few dozen who didn’t die yet were at the verge
of death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both a ki and a Body
Refiner? Peak Xiantian? Let’s take a look.” The black-clothed man
snorted, then walked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Powers
[Heaven, Earth, Man] as the foundation.” Ji Ning, surrounded and
protected by his Waterflame Lotus, was seated in the lotus position,
quietly chanting while looking at the formation around himself. “The
Five Elements, with water and earth making up the majority…the
variables lie in these areas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his mind, a model of
this enormous formation naturally came into being. He was currently
thoroughly investigating the secrets of this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly rose to
his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, he
transformed into blur and repeatedly changed directions several
times. The faster he moved, the greater the amount of pressure he
would place on the formation, giving him a chance to test where the
strengths and weaknesses of the formation lay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is even more
profound and intricate than the formation I just envisioned.” Ning
shook his head. “If I had a chance to see the formation flags or
formation marks, I would quickly understand the secrets of this
formation.” He knew that this was a formation controlled by a Zifu
Disciple. Perhaps because the Zifu Disciple, for some special
reasons, was busy, he had been unable to come and deal with Ning
personally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning knew that this
was just a temporary situation. Once the Zifu Disciple attacked,
given how powerful a Zifu Disciple naturally was, given that Ning was
trapped within this confusing formation, he would definitely die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must break this
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time was of the
essence. Under this invisible pressure, Ning whole-heartedly was
analyzing this formation, and his understanding of formations was
constantly increasing. Fortunately, his previous life had given him a
good foundation, while in this life, his soul was incredibly
powerful, and he also had the guide to formations left behind by that
Loose Immortal. Only because he had these three aspects combined did
he have such an astonishing rate of improvement. However, to break
this formation by this Zifu Disciple…he was still quite a ways off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great formation of
this Zifu Disciple, if one wanted to destroy it through strength,
would have to use tremendous force! Power at the same level naturally
wouldn’t be enough. Perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept would find it
difficult to destroy it forcibly. As for Ning, without question, he
had to defeat the formation through understanding its secrets. Only
then would he be able to easily defeat it. Break through it by raw
force? He was far from being able to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu!” The black fog
in front of him seemed to grow slightly dimmer. A dark figure could
faintly be seen in the distance, which was currently looking at Ning,
seated in the lotus position, with curiosity. “Control over water
and fire? That protective lotus seems to be rather extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
was currently holding a bottle in his hand. He pulled the stopper
out, and the bottle began to release gusts of a mind-intoxicating
scent. This bottle contained within it ‘Intoxicating Dragonspit’.
If one directly drank this thing, perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept would
immediately faint. But of course, it would be quite hard to get a
Wanxiang Adept to drink it. After all, as soon as he smelled it, he
would know not to drink it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scent of
Intoxicating Dragonspit alone, when smelled, was enough to cause
virtually all Xiantian lifeforms to faint and collapse. As the senior
apprentice, he had been bestowed this Intoxicating Dragonspit by his
revered master, which was why he was able to stealthily capture so
many Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fall, fall, fall!”
The black-clothed figure looked expectantly at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lotus-position
seated Ning felt a fragrance assault his nostrils. Immediately, his
body went soft and his head grew dizzy. However, by relying on the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and the Fiendgod body it
had given him, which was incomparably stronger than that of normal
Fiendgods, although Ning felt slightly dizzy, the divine power in his
body, when activated, quickly blocked this feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which scoundrel is
using tricks from hiding!” Ning hurriedly stood up and shouted
loudly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha. You are
indeed a Xiantian-level Fiendgod, and thus very hard to make faint.”
The distant black-clothed man walked over. “A Xiantian-level
Fiendgod Body Refiner whose body is akin to a Fiendgod’s. To make
you faint is as hard as making a Zifu-level Ki Refiner faint. This is
why all of the people I have been capturing in Swallow Mountain have
been Xiantian Ki Refiners.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian Ki
Refiners, upon smelling this, will immediately collapse. After
destroying their dantian, they won’t be able to resist at all.
Fiendgod practitioners, however, will be able to regrow their dantian
after it is destroyed. They are quite hard to control. In addition,
torturing a Xiantian Body Refiner to death is too hard.” The
black-clothed man mumbled to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant, black-clothed figure. His swords were in his hands, and he
was incomparably cautious, because the distant man, when walking
over, gave off an invisible pressure…the tyrannical aura which only
a Xiantian Fiendgod gave off. Clearly, the man had already activated
the divine power in his body. Once his power was fully activated, he
would attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You said you
captured Xiantian lifeforms?” Ning stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
didn’t answer the question. A look on his face that seemed like a
smile and yet wasn’t, he said to Ning, “If my guess is correct,
you should be young master ‘Ji Ning’ of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ji Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this era,
communication was only possible through shouting to others, while
distant communication was through running between tribes. Thus, only
the high level members of some tribes knew of Ji Ning’s name. Even
if they knew his name, however, they wouldn’t be able to recognize
him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I didn’t
guess wrongly.” The black-clothed man sighed. “In the entire
Swallow Mountain area, there can only be one person who is so young
in appearance, and yet is a Xiantian lifeform who is even capable of
making my fellow apprentices think he is a peak Xiantian expert. The
only person capable of this must be the one who kicked down the city
walls with three kicks and sent River Sansi flying with one kick.
Young master Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know quite a
lot.” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
sighed. “Of course. I have to. In accordance with the orders from
my master, I had to go capture a large number of Xiantian lifeforms
throughout the Swallow Mountain region. Naturally, I need a good
understanding of the intelligence reports regarding the various
Xiantian experts of the Swallow Mountain area. If I didn’t prepare
in advance and ended up accidentally ‘kicking an iron board’, I
would be in trouble! For example, your father, Ji Yichuan…he had
become a peak Xiantian long ago, and I even suspect that he is
already a Zifu Disciple. I definitely wouldn’t go capture a person
like him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only after getting a
good understanding of a person would I go capture him. That is why so
many Xiantian lifeforms went missing in the Swallow Mountain area,
and yet no one knows who did it.” The black-clothed man looked at
Ning. “So young, and yet so astonishingly strong. In the entire
Swallow Mountain area, only you fit the criteria. In addition, this
is the territory of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and you
yourself are of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Xiantian lifeforms
had gone missing in the Swallow Mountain area? Why was it that he
hadn’t heard of this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this was
something which had only recently occurred. The capture of Xiantian
lifeforms had to be done quickly. By the time the disappearance was
noticed, perhaps days would have passed, and it also took time for
the entire tribe to make a decision on what to do. Thus, he had to
frantically seize the opportunity to capture as many as he could. He
couldn’t capture them slowly. Once the major powers of the various
forces of Swallow Mountain reacted and began to set traps, it would
be dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nearly a hundred
Xiantian experts have ‘gone missing’ in Swallow Mountain.” The
black-robed man looked at Ning. “Because this place is near the Ji
clan, many of the Ji clan have gone missing, twenty four in total.
There are some who directly belong to your Ji clan, while others
belong to the tribes of your Ji clan. The Ji clan controls so much
territory that I imagine up till now, your Ji clan still hasn’t
gotten a full picture of how many Xiantian lifeforms have gone
missing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan…had
actually…had actually lost many Xiantian lifeforms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some have gone
‘missing’ from your Ji clan of the West Prefecture as well. Let
me report a few names. I imagine you recognize them.” The
black-clothed man said. “Ji Jadewich. Ji Shan. Poortile.
Earthshaker. Blindfish. These five all directly belong to your Ji
clan of the West Prefecture. You should know them, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face instantly
turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Jadewich…that was
the son of Ji Lee, his most talented son. In the past, during the
fierce struggle between Ji Lee’s lienage and the current line in
control of the Prefecture Lord position, Jadewich had been one of the
most fiercest in the struggle. Ning had once deeply disliked this
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Shan was a Xiantian
lifeform of a younger generation of the Ji clan. Although he wasn’t
a Commander, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had very great
expectations for him. After all, his surname was ‘Ji’, and he
also belonged to the primary line of descent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Poortile was a newly
promoted Xiantian lifeform which had been trained and recruited by
the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. In Western Prefecture City, Ning
had seen him quite a few times. Each time when Poortile saw him, he
would bow slightly and call out, “Young master Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthshaker was one of
the twelve Commanders of the Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish…Blindfish….Blindfish!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master Blindfish!”
Ning’s heart was trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Master Blindfish had
taught him archery. To Ning, he was the closest, most familiar figure
of the five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
familiar figures. After all, ever since he was young, he had grown up
in Western Prefecture City. He had met with all of the Xiantian
lifeforms of Western Prefecture City. Each year, at the gathering at
Snowfall Palace, he would see this group of people. He was very
familiar with them all. These people were his clansmen! Some of them
had grudges against him, some of them were of the same lineage as
him, while some were friends of him. One of them as the master archer
who had taught him archery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ning’s
face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know them all,
right? Haha.” The black-clothed man suddenly shouted loudly, “Ji
Jadewich, Ji Shan, Poortile, Earthshaker, Blindfish, your young
master Ji Ning of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture is within the
formation. Your young master Ji Ning will soon accompany you!
Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice was very
loud, and it transmitted directly into the distant tunnel midway up
the mountain.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish’s body was
covered with blood, and he was currently tied to that pillar. Ever
since the day he had arrived in this hellish place, he had lost all
hope. Currently, he was currently grinding his teeth, enduring the
pain while taunting them, “Is that all you got? Harder, hit me
harder. Come at me, boy. Didn’t you drink enough milk when you were
a lad?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your young master Ji
Ning will soon be coming to keep you company! Hahaha…” That
laughter rang towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
bearded Blindfish’s body trembled, and then he roared hoarsely with
all his might, “Young master Ji Ning, hurry and flee! There is an
Immortal practitioner here developing an evil magic treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Jadewich, also bound
by Blindfish’s side, had been holding his head down, exhausted, but
now his spirit was roused, and he raised his head as well. He
murmured: “Ji Ning? Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! Quick,
flee! Quick, leave!” Jadewich howled desolately as well, striving
to make himself heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, although
he had wanted for his father’s lineage to take over the Prefecture
Lord position, since they had lost, he had submitted whole-heartedly.
Ji Ning was their Ji clan of the West Prefecture’s next Prefecture
Lord! He had personally seen Ning’s talent, and knew that the Ji
clan of the West Prefecture would definitely become even more
powerful because of Ji Ning. His dantian had already been destroyed
and he had been captured. He didn’t want the most promising genius
of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, the next Prefecture Lord of
the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, to die here as well. This was a
humiliation to the Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
Jadewiched howled heroically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, quick, leave!” Ji Shan howled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all been
caught here, and had often seen those dread wraiths enter that
underground tunnel. From that, as well as the discourse of those six
handsome men and women, they had learned…that this was utterly a
devil’s lair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog around
him billowed, but from afar came furious, frantic howls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, hurry up and flee! There is an Immortal practitioner here
developing an evil magic treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had been
tortured to the point of their voices turning hoarse, because he was
so familiar with these people, Ning could tell who they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devleoping an evil
magic treasure?” Ning forcibly swallowed down the fiery anger in
his heart as he stared at the black-clothed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
chortled strangely. “The genius of the Ji clan, the mighty young
master Ji Ning…don’t be so impatient, don’t be so angry. They
will all die. As for you, you’ll die too.” He wanted to arouse
Ning’s fury. When a person was enraged, they would lose their calm,
and after doing so, their chances of victory would decrease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go die!” Ning was
like a tiger leaving the mounting, releasing a surge of seemingly
unblockable power as he charged straight forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, so rash. And
they say you are a genius? In the end, you are still too young.”
The black-clothed man said to himself. In his hands, he wielded black
weaver’s shuttles in each hand, whirling them like devils as he
welcomed the charging Ning. The two black shuttles stabbed towards
Ning, and as the two drew near…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two black shuttles
actually shot out multiple black needles in a cluster towards Ning.
Because they were too close, and the attack of the black needles was
simply too fast, although Ning’s swordplay was powerful, he found
it hard to block them all. Luckily, Ning’s body had those two
layers of the Waterflame Lotus to block those black needles. The
black needles just barely managed to break through the first layer
before collapsing, and as they did, the earth immediately began to
emit a hissing sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All stained with
poison.” The two Darknorth swords in Ning’s hands stabbed angrily
outwards towards the black-clothed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
moved like a ghost, the two black shuttles in his hands just barely
able to dodge while also shooting out those black needles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable Ji
Ning.” The black-clothed man was secretly shocked. “His
protective lotus flower is too powerful. It’s actually able to
affect even my own movements. Luckily, my robes are actually formed
from an armor-type magic treasure, as otherwise, the power of the
protective lotus alone would have torn my clothes apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword shadow suddenly
pierced through the black-clothed man’s arm, and the black-clothed
man immediately leapt backwards at high speed, his face gradually
turning savage. “What a marvelous, profound protective lotus you
have. My Blackblood Needles are unable to break through it. It seems
I’ll have to use power to break it.” The two black shuttles in
his hands disappeared, and then in his hands appeared a long staff
formed from six shuttles, while at the same time, the area around the
body of the man began to faintly swirl with fire as a powerful aura
began to emanate outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Staff?” Ning was
secretly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, when they had
battled, he had noticed that this black-clothed man’s ability in
wielding those black shuttles was truly quite weak. Only, the sudden
shooting out of those Blackblood Needles was rather sinister. Now
that the opponent was using a staff, Ning finally understood…that
this was the weapon which the opponent was actually an expert in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A staff is a long
weapon and a heavy weapon.” Ning mused. “Fiendgod Body Refiners
generally like to use heavy weapon type magic treasures, using power
to break through magic.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Receive my attacks.”
The black-clothed man transformed into a black blur, and the
longstaff was lifted up high and instantly began to increase in size
rapidly, while its weight rapidly increased as well. The staff itself
most likely now weighed tens of thousands of kilograms, and it
smashed down directly towards Ning’s head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Darknorth
swords swept upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous clashing
sound. Ning himself was sent flying backwards, creating a deep gouge
in the earth. His two hands had cracked apart at the thumb, and blood
had already dyed the sword handles red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power, even greater than mine by far. Although I am merely at the
fourth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], I’m
still comparable to most late-stage Fiendgod Body Refiners. This
black-clothed man is actually even stronger than me. He must be a
peak Fiendgod Body Refiner.” Ning understood that he had
encountered a true opponent this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To kill an Fiendgod
Body Refiner at the Xiantian level was a much harder proposition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see how
many staff blows of mine you can take.” The eyes of the
black-clothed man flashed with a faint green light. He charged
forwards with large steps, emanating an aura as mighty as a dragon’s,
and as he drew near Ning, he delivered the longstaff in his hands in
a forward blow. A direct attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Staves focus on
power! Swords focus on skill!” Ning shouted, while at the same
time, a pair of green wings appeared behind him, seemingly made out
of steel. This was the wing-type magic treasure which Ning had
acquired out of the thousands of magic treasures found in the Aquatic
Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Shadewind Steps]
was nothing more than one of the most basic foundations to the divine
ability, [Windwing Evasion]. When using this set of wings to utilize
this divine ability, the power was much greater, comparable to a
tiger being given a set of wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s wings
trembled, and instantly, like a giant Roc, his speed tremendously,
bizarrely increased. He flashed past like a gust of wind, constantly
changing direction as the Darknorth swords in his hands struck out
once and again against the black-clothed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yayayaya!” The
black-clothed man was completely in a state of frenzy. His ki had
activated the runes scribed onto his longstaff, causing the power of
the Weight Seal to continue to grow. The staff seemed to have
transformed into a small mount. Luckily, he was a peak Xiantian
Fiendgod Body Refiner, as otherwise he wouldn’t even be able to
budge such a heavy weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t hit
someone with the staff, so what if it is heavy? Die!” Ning seemed
to have been possessed as well. The existence of that Zifu Disciple
was a source of invisible pressure for him. Those tormented clansmen
of the Ji clan caused Ning’s heart to feel as though it was being
scorched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, relying on his
wing-type magic treasures, moved like a ghost, his speed even greater
than the black-clothed figure’s. The Darknorth swords in his hands,
having already undergone a Bloodforging, were incomparably sharp. His
swordplay which contained the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’, in terms
of technique, was at a level higher than the black-clothed man’s as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” A large
hole was blasted through the waist by a piercing blow, but then
immediately afterwards, the hole immediately grew small, then
disappeared, having completely healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!” A large
wound was carved out on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi.” His face was
cut and scarred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yayaya!!!” The
black-clothed man was being driven insane by this battle. His all but
unkillable body, when paired with his ‘one with the world’ level
of staff-play, allowed him to easily dominate most peak Xiantian Ki
Refiners. He hadn’t expected that this time, he had run into a
wall. The opponent’s strength was a good deal weaker than his, but
the opponent was nonetheless an expert Fiendgod Body Refiner whose
swordplay was clearly on a higher level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was sent flying
away by a grazing blow of the staff. Although the skin on his hands
were ripped open from the shock of the collision, they instantly
healed. After all, as his swordplay was extremely skilled, Ning would
only occasionally suffer a bit, while the opponent was truly dancing
on the fine line between life and death. If he was to be stabbed by
Ning in the head, a fatal blow, then he would die for sure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Using both
swords at the same time and moving like a ghost, the dance at the
precipice of life and death finally came to a stumbling halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man’s
waist had a sword light flash past it, and an enormous wound
appeared. He fell to the ground, his body chopped in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” The black-clothed man ground his teeth. “However,
you can go die now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning’s wings
fluttered and he pounced towards the black-clothed man with his two
swords, a bottle appeared in one of the hands of the black-robed man.
He suddenly smashed it into the ground, which immediately exploded
open against the rocky floor of the mountain. A thick white fog
instantly poured out. Ning, seeing the situation looked bad,
hurriedly retreated at high speed, but the faint fragrance still
assaulted his nostrils. Although he had already stopped his breathing
early on, that odor still invaded and burrowed through his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform into a
pool of liquid!” The black-clothed man gritted his teeth as he
stared at Ning, the two halves of his body quickly drawing close
together and beginning to fuse together.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_18___A_Heroic__Frenzied"></A>
Chapter 18 - A Heroic, Frenzied Shout
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white mist within
the bottle was an essence removed from corpses and transformed into
gaseous form. Once it touched the body, it would quickly invade and
corrode the body, melting it into a puddle of liquid! Even this peak
Xiantian ‘senior apprentice’ himself had to use an antidote
against it. The youth in front of him was clearly weaker than him in
strength, and based on his understanding, young master Ji Ning had
only recently broken through to the Xiantian level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how
monstrous of a genius you are, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, you are
far inferior to me. Even I am not able to withstand it. You will
definitely die.” The black-clothed man looked expectantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
It really was a case of a certain type of master producing a certain
type of disciple! In the past, Ning had calculated that this Zifu
Disciple must be an expert poison user, and this black-clothed fellow
in front of him was also skilled in poisons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white corrosive
fog…Ning felt numbness begin to spread and erode his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta hold!” Ning
circulated the Shining Scarlet divine power in his body, and the
powerful Fiendgod life energy also began to wipe away the poison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” While
forcibly suppressing this corpse essence in his body, the wing-type
magic treasure on his back suddenly howled as Ning pounced towards
the black-clothed man on the floor. Regardless of whether or not he
was able to disperse this corpse essence in his body, he had to first
kill the man in front of him. Otherwise, if he were to be dead from
poison while the other was still alive, how hateful a thought would
that be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, the more you
move, the faster you die.” The black-clothed man wielded the six
shuttle longstaff, his footsteps thundering on the ground and causing
the earth to shake. Clearly, he was using all of his strength! “Go
die!” He raised the six shuttle longstaff high, smashing it down
towards Ning like a giant mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Relying on
the Windwing Evasion, Ning moved like a ghost, moving in an arc to
attack the black-clothed man from the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
Ning wildly pounced forward, while the longstaff in the black-clothed
man changed directly slightly to welcome Ning. The two had already
exchanged blows multiple times and knew very well how powerful the
enemy was. The black-clothed man was physically strong, while Ning’s
swordplay was marvelous, and he was an expert in twin swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A nearby piece of
head-sized rock suddenly flew up, moving at supersonic speed as it
smashed towards the black-clothed man’s head. The distance was too
close, and the stone came flying from behind…the black-clothed man
didn’t have eyes in his back. By the time he vaguely sensed the
ripples in the air caused by the stone, it was too late!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The stone,
wrapped up by Ning’s divine will, was moving at an incredible
speed. It was as though a late-stage Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner
expert had viciously thrown it at full force against his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone shattered
into tiny pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood flowed from the
black-clothed man’s head, while at the same time, he stumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!” “Chi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two rays of sword
light, one which blocked the six-shuttle longstaff, while the other
sword light slashed straight through the black-clothed man’s face,
stabbing out from the back of his skull, carrying some brain matter
and blood!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
six-shuttle longstaff stick forced Ning to retreat backwards by
multiple steps, and naturally the sword was drawn out as well. There
was a hole directly in the forehead of the black-clothed man, but
there was no way it could possibly be healed. Forget about him; if
Ning’s skull had been pierced through, even he would have died
without question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you….”
Fiendgod Body Refiners possessed astonishing life force, allowing the
black-clothed man to have a final few moments of life. He stared at
Ning, struggling to open his mouth. “You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then he fell down,
causing the ground to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huff…huff…huff…”
Ning stood there, his breathing rather ragged. He stared at the
corpse in front of him, knowing how unwilling this person had been to
accept death like this, how mystified this person had been in death.
Most likely, this black-clothed ‘senior apprentice’, in the
moment of his death, was still trying to puzzle out why his head had
suddenly suffered an attack. Who had attacked him from behind?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine will. This was
Ning’s killing technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once it was used, if he
was unable to kill his enemies with it, his enemies would immediately
use Escape Seals and instantly run away. Most likely, by then, even
the Zifu Disciple would know that Ning possessed a ‘divine will’
ability. Thus, it was not to be used lightly, and when used, it had
to kill the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
been fighting with him head on, but because of the poison, Ning could
no longer afford to waste time. Thus, he used his divine will to
control the stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had been on par
in terms of general power. In a life and death battle, one couldn’t
be the slightest bit careless. When that stone had carried boundless
force in smashing down on the black-clothed man’s head, his staff
techniques had become completely chaotic. Naturally, he was even less
able to fend off Ning’s divine, ghost-like swordplay, with the
result being a sword stabbing straight through his fatal point
between his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
began to laugh, raising his head and shouting heroically, “Come!
Each one of you who comes shall die! However many comes, however many
I shall kill! Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Ning
was incomparably crazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in utterly dire
straits, and his clansmen had been trapped here. His chance of
survival was very slim. Ning naturally became all the more frenzied.
Killing an expert of the enemy naturally made him feel incomparably
satisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were deep gouges
everywhere on the ground, with shattered rocks littering everywhere.
After all, prior to this, Ning’s swordplay had activated the power
of the world itself, while the enemy was also incomparably strong.
Naturally, the area around them had been reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Poison?” Ning
could already sense that the corpse essence in his body was being
slowly ground away by the natural life force in his body that was
being created by the Crimsonbright divine power. “It seems it still
can’t do anything against my Fiendgod body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was different from
that black-clothed ‘senior apprentice’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
couldn’t withstand the poison…but Ning trained in the number one
Fiendgod Body Refining technique, while the Crimsonbright divine
power was born from a fusion of the power of the sun and the power of
the moon, while his divine body had been formed and birthed by Solar
Truefire and Lunar Truewater. In terms of quality, his body was
untold times more powerful than other Fiendgod Body Refiner bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That black-clothed
man’s power was clearly much greater than the previous man’s.
Most likely, he has a fairly high status in this place. Perhaps he
has some secrets on this formation on him.” Ning hurriedly began to
search the black-clothed man’s corpse, but unfortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciple
himself actually wasn’t an expert in formations. All he had done
was set up formation flags in a very formulaic way. Ning thus
naturally wasn’t able to find any information regarding this
formation on the corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, he has
quite a few Dao-seals and bottles and elixirs on him.” Ning
collected them all, but didn’t have any time to investigate these
battles. First of all, he didn’t dare to pull out the stoppers for
fear of them being poisoned, and second of all, he himself didn’t
know anything about poisons. It was best for him to spend his time
focusing on the formation and increasing his abilities in formations.
Breaking this formation as soon as possible was what mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six beautifully
dressed men and women were currently, as per the senior apprentice’s
orders, torturing these Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, with our
senior apprentice personally handling this, your young master Ji
Ning’s death is assured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the formation, I
heard senior apprentice say that young master Ji Ning is still a
youth? Little Seven, you are nearly thirty years old this year. Can
it be that this young master Ji Ning is even younger than you?” The
six men and women chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the nearby men
bound to the pillar, a bald man whose body was covered with scars,
howled at them, “Young master Ji Ning of the Ji clan is perhaps
just eleven or twelve years old this year. Compared to him, you are
like worms on the ground while he is like a divine dragon in the
skies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
The nearby servants immediately used heated irons to torture and burn
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six fools! You want
to compare yourselves to young master Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t even begin
to express how inferior you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, almost
thirty years old, but he wants to compare himself to young master Ji
Ning? I’m laughing so hard my stomach hurts!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those nearly hundred
Xiantian lifeforms of the Swallow Mountain area all began to shout
out and mock them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat them, beat
them!” The six men and women shouted angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come! Each one of
you who comes shall die! However many comes, however many I shall
kill! Hahaha…” That wild, frenzied voice was filled with both
hysteria and utter, incomparable madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The faces
of those six changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were certain that
this wasn’t the voice of the senior apprentice. Then…it could be
only the voice of that trapped young master Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that our
senior apprentice-brother died?” They were all in a state of panic.
Without question, the senior apprentice was by far the most powerful
of their group. Even if he didn’t use the many insidious options
available to him, he was still incomparably strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six men and women
shouted outwards, but their senior apprentice-brother didn’t
respond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to find
your senior apprentice-brother, then go to the Netherworld Kingdom!”
That wild, impudent voice rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother died.” The six men and women looked at each
other, their eyes filled with awe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killed by a youth of
just eleven or twelve years of age.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only eleven or
twelve, yet he was able to kill our senior apprentice-brother? Is…is
there such a monstrous talent in the world? Even in our school, there
has never been such a monster. Most likely, only those legendary
top-tier tribes under the protection of Immortals will there be
monsters like this.” The six were completely overawed. After all,
they quite broad experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their own school was a
major school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they had never seen
anyone eleven or twelve years old who was so possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kakaka…” The
iron board in the center of the mountain began to slowly swing open,
revealing that dark, gloomy tunnel. The tunnel had a hint of green
light emanating from within it, and its cold, sinister aura caused
the six men and women to shiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My boy Gan!” That
shrill voice was quavering. “That ‘Ji Ning’ killed my boy Gan.
He will die, definitely die!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six men and women
felt their hearts shake. As for those servants, all of them were
shuddering. None of them could predict what this person would do when
enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ‘Ji Ning’
is only eleven or twelve years old? What a monster. If it weren’t
for the fact that he is an enemy, I would recommend him for entry
into our school. But he killed my boy Gan! He must die!” The shrill
voice was filled with hate. “Little Seven, come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in?” The
handsome youth was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never before
entered the cavern in the mountain. That was a forbidden area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, enter.” The
shrill voice carried anger within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The handsome
youth didn’t dare to hesitate any longer. Clearing his throat, he
hurriedly walked towards the black tunnel, then leapt into the
cavern.

Chapter 19 - Corrosive Heart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark tunnel was
deep and also almost as straight as a pen. It was nearly three
hundred meters deep, and the handsome youth, when jumping down,
released his Xiantian Ki, allowing himself to descend as lightly as a
goose feather, while at the same time, every so often, he would grab
onto the sides of the dark tunnel to slow his descent. After a while,
he finally stepped on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is so deep. Uh,
where is Master’s secret room?” The handsome youth hurriedly
looked everywhere while carefully advancing through the winding
tunnels. Up ahead, there was a dazzling green light. Soon, he reached
an open stone door, behind which was an area filled with green life,
as well as ripples which made the heart tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
handsome youth called out from outside the stone door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter.” The shrill
voice screeched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The handsome
youth suppressed his terror and walked in. This was a sealed stone
room that was ten meters in diameter. In the center of the stone
room, there was an enormous boulder, upon which was a man who wore
loose black robes, had a skinny, pale face, and long, flowing black
hair. The man’s eyes emitted an otherworldly green light, and his
entire body seemed to be made out of solidified evil.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of this person
was an enormous cauldron, and above the cauldron, there was a burning
green flame that emitted a freezing aura. Beneath the green flame,
there lay hovering an unadorned, blood-red cloth banner, which had a
number of either hidden or visible ferocious faces on it. The faces
were either screaming soundlessly or bellowing as they tried to
swallow each other and battled each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire cloth banner
was surrounded by a layer of black light that was visible to the
naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sin!” The handsome
youth’s heart was trembling. “A grave sin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who did good
accumulated karmic merit. Those who did evil accumulated sins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who had committed
grave sins would naturally emanate a heart-shaking evil aura. But the
aura of sin around the cloth banner was actually so strong, it was
visible to the naked eye. This was simply astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a magic
treasure which was born from endless amounts of sin.” The handsome
youth was both terrified as well as desirous. He knew very well that
when one created this sort of magic treasure that was refined from
sins, when one underwent the Three Calamities or Nine Tribulations,
the power of the trials would be incomparably powerful. But this sort
of magic treasure itself was incomparably, astonishingly powerful as
well. This was why some evil schools were clearly committing
countless grave sins, and yet were still able to continue forward in
training to become an Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was because these
evil paths allowed one to advance more quickly, and to even battle
against foes of higher levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Master
said that once his magic treasure is completed, he wouldn’t even
fear a Wanxiang Adept.” The handsome youth couldn’t breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Seven.” The
long-haired man, seated in the lotus position, spoke in a shrill
voice. “My boy Gan was my first disciple. He was like a son to me!
This Ji Ning killed my son. How could I, Bei Goodson, possibly
forgive him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
lowered his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to refine
this magic treasure. I can’t spare any attention.” Bei Goodson’s
green eyes stared at the handsome youth. Creating this sort of deeply
sinful magic treasure was incomparably dangerous to begin with, and
there were constant repercussions from the creation process. There
were some people who were themselves bitten to death and had their
souls dispersed by the dread wraiths they had created. Of course, if
one truly wanted to force a pause, one could, but the price would
also be great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Seven, I
bequeath unto you one Hearteater Powder.” A bottle appeared out of
nowhere in the palm of Goodson’s right hand, and he casually tossed
it towards the handsome youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
accepted it, then stared at the bottle in terror. “Hearteater
Powder?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had heard of the
famous Hearteater Powder before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The price of this one
bottle of Hearteater Powder was more valuable than even a ranked
magic treasure. Countless Zifu Disciples had died to Hearteater
Powder, and it was incredibly hard to procure. Even his own master
had only been able to acquire this terrifying poison because he had
been born into their school and had connections.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
the fact that I can’t be distracted, how would I possibly be
willing to waste this Hearteater Powder?” Goodson said shrilly.
“Remember. Smash the bottle within thirty meters of that Ji Ning,
and he will definitely be poisoned. Once the Hearteater Powder enters
his body, although it takes effect slowly and will need three days,
it is virtually impossible to get rid of it once one has been
poisoned. He, a mere Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner, will die without
question, even if what he is training in is the legendary number one
Fiendgod Body Refining, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
nodded
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. You
yourself need to be careful. Stay far away. If you are poisoned, come
to me. I will give you the antidote.” Goodson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple is
still competent to perform a minor task like releasing poison.” The
handsome youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Goodson’s
gaze fell upon that blood-red cloth banner beneath the swirling green
flames. The countless dread wraiths within the cloth banner
occasionally appeared, extending their necks out towards Goodson and
wildly trying to bite at him, but Goodson’s oily green eyes
remained cold and deadly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome youth
bowed respectfully, then left. When leaving this deep, dark tunnel,
he jumped at high speed, occasionally clamping onto protruding pieces
of rock on the stone walls. Soon afterwards, he left the tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kakaka…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The iron boards turned,
and the tunnel was shut once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the black mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
surrounded him, and Ning’s soul was currently pondering at high
speed, with one hypothetical formation after another appearing within
his mind, and the construction of the formation changing nonstop. As
Ning frantically analyzed these formations, his level of
understanding with regards to formations continued to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
suddenly felt a spike of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a person’s soul
was as powerful as his, one would be able to unconsciously sense
terrifying dangers approaching. The last time his soul had this
feeling was when he was attempting the third trial in the ancient
Aquatic Manor. This time, however, the feeling was even stronger than
last time, as though no matter how he struggled, he still wouldn’t
be able to escape this danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Danger?” Ning
opened his eyes to stare around himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog in front
of him to the right naturally parted, and in that instant, a large
amount of white threads instantly wrapped towards him. In the
distance, that handsome youth could be seen wielding a horsetail
whisk in one hand and a Dao-seal in the other. The white threads of
the horsetail whisk instantly attacked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Twin swords
appeared in Ning’s hands, and the Waterflame Lotus blocked those
white threads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant when
those thousands of white strands and the Waterflame Lotus collided,
it was as though something exploded. Only now did Ning realize that
the thousands of white strands of had contained a bottle within it.
In the instant their attacks had collided, the bottle had been
smashed apart. Seeing the battle smash open, his soul could feeling
that incomparably terrifying danger sense intensify, causing Ning’s
face to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There had to have
been something in the bottle.” Ning was no fool, but he couldn’t
see anything. It was odorless and invisible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant, handsome
youth had immediately retracted his horsetail whisk in that instant
the bottle had smashed open, and had also used his Escape Seal,
immediately fleeing and disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this bottle.”
Ning had an uneasy feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a stabbing
pain appeared in his heart. Ning’s face turned ashen, and he held
his chest. The Crimsonbright divine power in his body immediately
began to search throughout his entire body, but no matter what, it
still couldn’t find any hint of poison. However, his heart
continued to feel that slow, stabbing pain, and his entire body began
to slowly ache. There was no way to stop it at all. Even his head was
starting to hurt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
The poison has invaded my entire body, but my Crimsonbright divine
power isn’t able to sense it, nor can my divine will.” Ning, at
this moment, suddenly remembered the words of that old black bull in
the underwater estate. He had been warned not to underestimate any
opponent, especially those who trained to become Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal practitioners
had varied techniques. One could simply use poison to kill you. No
matter how powerful your ability to fight was, they could simply
refuse to fight you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how Immortal
practitioners were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody knew what anyone
else was truly capable of….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” From
afar, a delighted sound could be heard. “Ji Ning, no matter how
monstrous of a genius you are, you will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that great
formation, Ning’s face was unsightly. Although neither his divine
will nor his Crimsonbright divine power could sense the poisonous
elements, he could feel the pain wracking his entire body. This
invisible poison was slowly, constantly devouring his entire body.
Although the devouring process was slow, it was inexorable in its
progress. Even his incomparably powerful Fiendgod lifeforce in his
body was unable to remove it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fierce
poison. Odorless, colorless, and undetectable.” Ning was surprised.
“Although it isn’t like some other poisons which instantly take
effect, it seems to have embedded itself deep in every single cell.
There’s no way to remove it at all. If this continues, in most
likely just two or three days, my body will be finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two or three days?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes began
wild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the last two or
three days, even if I die, I will destroy this formation.” Ning’s
heart was beginning to blaze with a heaven-reaching fury. “I will
wipe them all out, or if I’m lucky, maybe even find the antidote on
their bodies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nowhere to
run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must destroy this
formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position and closed his eyes. The protective lotus flower
swivelled around him as he once more frantically endeavoured to
analyze formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That handsome youth
walked back, then glanced at Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, and the other
members of the Ji clan, who had looks of shock and fury on their
faces. The other members of the Ji clan of the East Prefecture, North
Prefecture, South Prefecture, and Central Prefecture all looked at
him angrily as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you looking
at? Your young master Ji Ning was poisoned. In three days, he will
definitely die.” The handsome youth was completely confident.
“Forget about him. Even a Zifu Disciple who is poisoned by this
poison will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan’s
Patriarch will definitely come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will definitely
exterminate all of you, and he will also rescue young master Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish and the
others weren’t willing to believe that Ji Ning would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, your clan’s
Patriarch?” The handsome youth laughed wildly. “How could a small
tribe here in your Swallow Mountain possibly have poison of this
level? Even in our school, this sort of poison is hard to obtain.
Stop looking at me. I won’t tell you what poison it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You will all
definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the Ji
clan all cursed at him, and even the other bound Xiantian lifeforms
began to curse in their despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within West Prefecture
City of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan was
currently accompanying his wife, Yuchi Snow. Occasionally, he would
look outside towards the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, through the
door, he could see that from afar, an Azure Firebird appeared in the
skies, with two people on its back. One was the red-clothed Ji
Redflower, while the other was a red-haired, gray-robed elder. At a
single glance, Ji Yichuan recognized him…that was the true pillar
for the entire Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan’s clan
leader, Ji Ninefire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow, Snow, the clan
leader is here.” Yichuan hurriedly shouted.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_20___Wait_For_Your_Child"></A>
Chapter 20 - Wait For Your Child
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Firebird
landed in the courtyard, and the red-haired, gray-robed Ji Ninefire
stepped own, arriving outside the room’s door in just two steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Ninefire
had a smile that would make a person feel peaceful. According to
legend, when Ninefire was young, he had an incomparably explosive
temperament, but because Ninefire had lived nearly four centuries by
now, while the oldest member of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture
was only a century or so in age, the stories of what Ninefire had
been like when young were lost to legends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader.” Ji
Yichuan, upon seeing the clan leader, immediately revealed a look of
urgency in his eyes. “Snow, she…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard from
Redflower.” Ninefire nodded. “Let me take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
immediately led the way forward. At this moment, Snow had already
left her bed, curtseying respectfully. “Snow greets the clan
leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said, “Your
body is very weak right now. First lie down. There’s no need to
stand on empty ceremonies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did Snow half
lie down on the bed, while Ninefire sat on the chair by the side of
the bed. He stretched his hand out, placing it against Snow’s
wrist, gently tapping with his finger…immediately, a spot of red,
fiery light immediately enveloped Snow’s entire body. In this
instant, it seemed as though Snow’s entire body was covered by a
layer of flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan watched
nervously by the side, while Ninefire’s eyes were closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As much time as was
needed for a pot of tea to be brewed passed before the fiery light
surrounding Snow’s body vanished. Only now did Ninefire open his
eyes as well. Facing Yichuan, whose face was filled with
anticipation, Ninefire couldn’t help but let a soft sigh, then
gently shake his head. “The seeds of the illness have taken deep
root. There’s no way for it to be reversed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Yichuan’s
face instantly turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire sighed. “That
year, your wife was a peak Xiantian expert. During that disaster, it
was one thing for her foundation to have been damaged; if she had
been immediately treated, it would have been fine. But your wife then
executed that secret art which took her own life energy…it was like
another blow to her already heavily injured body, causing the illness
to be even more deeply rooted! Unless you can find some sort of pill
suitable for mortals to use to extend their lives…there is no other
method.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Longevity-enhancing
pill for mortals?” Yichuan looked his wife, and Snow looked back at
him. Their gazes intersected, and Snow sighed gently. “Yichuan, I
understand my illness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was just a matter
of consuming a longevity-enhancing pill, although such a pill would
be incomparably expensive, if Yichuan bankrupted himself, sold off
all his possessions as well as the thousands of unranked magic
treasures Ji Ning had given him, and also borrowed some money from
the Ji clan, he might be able to acquire one such pill. But the
additional requirement of ‘suitable for mortals to use’…the
price would instantly rise by several additional levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
medicinal pill, the more powerful the medicinal effect. A pill that
was capable of extending a person’s lifespan was a pill that defied
the natural course of heaven. A pill that not only did this but also
did it in such a way which allowed the weak, fragile bodies of a
mortal to be able to endure the process…the preciousness of such a
pill was far beyond what the likes of the Ji clan could possibly
imagine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Ninefire
said slowly, “I’ve refined some pills. I will immediately arrange
for them to be sent over. Your wife should have another three months
of life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three months!”
Yichuan’s face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow just revealed a
smile. She said, “Yichuan.” Yichuan hurriedly turned to look at
his wife, who laughed and said, “Three months is better than I had
anticipated. I regret nothing. I did what I did that year in order to
give birth to Ning. If I hadn’t given birth to Ning, I might have
been able to live an extra twenty years, but every single day of
those twenty years, I would have been in a hell of regret. But now,
every day of these ten years that I have lived, I have lived happily.
It’s enough, it’s enough. Have Ning come back. I want to see him.
As long as he is by my side, all is well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yichuan
hurriedly nodded, then after pondering for a moment, shouted,
“Brother Black, Azure Firebird.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, from
outside, a black-clothed man and an azure-clothed woman stepped in.
It was the human forms of the black serpent and the Azure Firebird.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Black.”
Yichuan said hurriedly. “Ji Ning will easily be able to recognize
your voice. Thus, ride atop the Azure Firebird and quickly head to
the border region between our Ji clan and the Ironwood clan.” As he
spoke, a map appeared in Yichuan’s hands. He just casually glanced
towards the door, making sure of their directions, then carefully
sensed the location of the jade sword which Ning was holding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Staring at the map,
Yichuan quickly ascertained a location. With a gentle tap of the
finger, he pointed to a mountain on the map, and a spot of blood
stained the map there. “Ji Ning is currently at this location. He
hasn’t moved this entire time. Based on my sense, although there
are slight uncertainties regarding the distance between us, he’s
definitely within a hundred kilometers of this mountain. As long as
you ride the Azure Firebird to the air above the mountain, then call
for him and say that his mother is critically ill and that he is to
quickly return, he will definitely hear it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
black-clothed man said hurriedly. “Yichuan, don’t worry. Ning’s
hearing ability is far beyond that of ordinary people’s. He should
be able to hear my voice from as far as two or three hundred
kilometers away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t possible
for mortals to project their voices a hundred kilometers, but it was
simple for a Xiantian lifeform. For example, when Ning had been at
Serpentwing Lake and shouted at Serpentwing, his voice had also
projected throughout the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Firebird, I’ll
have to trouble you to make a trip.” Yichuan looked at the
azure-garbed woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A small matter.”
The Azure Firebird’s voice was very gentle. “We can’t delay for
even a moment. I’ll immediately head out along with Elder Brother
Black.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
black-clothed man also nodded right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Taking the map with
them, the black-garbed man quickly mounted onto the back of the Azure
Firebird, then quickly flew towards the direction of the borders
between the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” Snow
watched as the Azure Firebird flew high into the sky, and in her
heart she began to miss her son. The closer she drew to death, the
more she wanted to see her son, her dearly beloved son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Firebird’s
speed was astonishingly fast. In less than two hours, she had already
arrived in the air above that mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
mountain.” The black serpent nodded. From high up in the air, it
was very easy to recognize the landscape below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Brother Black,
call for him right away.” The Azure Firebird urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The black
serpent stared below, then immediately infused his voice with
monstrous energy, shouting loudly, “Young master Ji Ning, your
mother is critically ill. Quickly return!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!” This voice
echoed down from the heavens, quickly covering an area of two hundred
kilometers of the forests and mountain below. And directly beneath
them, deep within that mountain…there were a million commoners,
whom the two spirit-beasts didn’t notice at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those Xiantian
lifeforms that were bound to the pillars were still undergoing
countless amounts of torment. They had to endure torture, and yet
they were still kept alive. This was because the longer they were
tortured, the greater the rage and hatred these Xiantian lifeforms
would feel! The more powerful, the deeper their hatred, the fiercer
the dread wraiths their souls would transform into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!” The voice
drifted down from far above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although a great
formation was hidden here, causing the curses and cries of the
million commoners within to be trapped and unable to leave, the
sounds from the outside world could still come in…it was much as
how the Zifu Disciple, ‘Bei Zishan’, was deep within the secret
in the mountain and could hear the sounds from the outside world,
even though the sounds from within the secret room wouldn’t go out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That way, they could
more easily detect what was going on in the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!” The voice
echoed throughout the mountains, the voice shockingly loud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a loud voice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is shouting up
there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six beautifully
dressed men and women all looked upwards towards the sky, with one of
them, a scraggly, bearded man, hurriedly saying, “Fellow
apprentices, do you hear that? They are calling for that Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s mother
is critically ill?” The women with the scorpion said in surprise.
“His mother’s ill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The
most muscular man of the group, a man with cyan hair, began to laugh
loudly. “That Ji Ning is a monstrously talented figure. If he is
allowed to develop, who knows how terrifying he will be in the
future? But he won’t be able to live for more than three days, and
is trapped within the formation. His mother is clearly critically
ill, but even if he shouts until he is hoarse, his voice won’t
escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
handsome youth sighed. “Most likely, he is in a state of extreme
rage right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must say, this Ji
Ning really is a formidable figure. At eleven or twelve years of age,
he was able to kill our senior martial-apprentice. But his final doom
is so pitiful. He will pass away in the midst of despair, rage, pain,
and regret. Hahaha…this is the end of this genius!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These fellow
apprentices chatted amongst themselves. They could imagine how Ji
Ning currently felt, which made them feel all the more delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Madame is critically
ill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yuchi Snow is
critically ill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan of the West
Prefecture’s Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, Poortile, and other members
were all incomparably astonished, enraged, and filled with hate. At
the same time, they felt a hint of pity for Ji Ning. After all, he
had less than three days to live, and his mother was critically ill,
yet he had no way to return…this sort of pain must be
heart-breaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. Everything was
exactly as how those fellow apprentices deep in the mountain
imagined. It was also exactly as Blindfish and the others feared.
Ning was currently feeling utterly agony and grief in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!” Ning’s
tears began to fall down uncontrollably. He was in such pain, his
entire body trembled. His heart felt as though it was being cut by a
knife. That woman who had loved him since he was a child, that woman
who had treated him as her world…that woman who always,
uncontrollably doted on him. She was actually critically ill?
Critically ill?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaah!” Ning
suddenly threw his head upwards, letting out a howl of incomparable
pain. This howl spread throughout the mountain, but no matter what,
it couldn’t spread out from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those six men
and women within the mountain residence, when they heard the howl,
their hearts couldn’t help but tremble. That could sense the
boundless grief and pain contained within that howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning.” Blindfish wept. That precocious, brilliant four year old
toddler who he had personally taught archery…how had he ended up
like this? This was even more agonizing and terrifying that the
torture his body had endured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to
leave, I’m going to leave, I’m going to leave.” Ning’s voice
was quavering. “Break the formation! I’m going to break the
formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning forced his eyes
shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An incomparably
powerful surge of emotion swept his entire body, filling his entire
spirit. He was going to break the formation!!! He had to leave it, he
had to go see that woman who treated him as more important than her
life. He had to see her!!! Otherwise, even if he died and went to the
Netherworld Kingdom, he would feel incomparable guilt and regret!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break the formation.
I’m going to break the formation.” Ning’s closed eyes were
trembling, and his soul, filled with this incomparably powerful
emotion that was even greater than what was felt at the moment
between life and death, reached a new limit as he frantically
visualized methods for the breaking of this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood began to leak out
from Ning’s nose, and blood was coming from his ears as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, this surge of
powerful emotion had injured his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s it!”
Ning’s soul, which had been constantly testing out new formations,
suddenly halted. An incomparably complicated formation model suddenly
appeared in his mind, which contained every possible variable within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!” Ning
raised his head, letting out a frenzied howl. “I will go back to
see you, I will definitely go back to see you! Wait for your child!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, he
transformed into a blur, moving through the formation. Ning moved
like a ghost, quickly reaching a place which was still covered with
thick black mist, but which had a black formation flag inserted into
the earth. The runes atop the formation flag were currently fashing.
Ning reached out, directly grabbing the flag and giving it a powerful
pull.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the black
mist that had been covering the entire world vanished, revealing a
clearly visible mountain scene. From afar, many servants were staring
in astonishment towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.” The six men
and women rushed out of the mountain, staring in his direction with
astonishment. “The formation was destroyed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was holding the
formation flag in his hand, the light of utter madness in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill him! Kill
him at all costs! He cannot be permitted to leave this place alive!”
Suddenly, a shrill voice filled with incomparable rage emanated from
underground.
